Mechanics are on the box or marketing copy, rulebooks are PDF's these days, and there are value judgements applenty. What I rely on reviewers for is to compare, and to show me the landscape.

No game exists in a vacuum. If a hot new deckbuilder is released, I'm interested in the following questions:

* How interactive is it (**Dominion** versus **Star Realms**)?
* Is the market a small sets of curated cards (**Dominion**) or a giant random stack (**Ascension**)?
* Are there auxiliary mechanics (**Clank!**, or **The Quest for El Dorado**)?
* How much variety is in the box?

In short, I'm looking for a comparison to what else is out there, and an overview of what similar games are on offer.

I have taken elses list of categories and put my answers in. Thanks u/qret

Auction - **Ra**. What a fun simple game. So dynamic and straight forward. There is so much tension. Calling an auction, slamming the token down and declaring ""RA!"" to hear everyone moan is a fantastic sensation.

Economic - **Concordia.** Fun, simple, straightforward but with depth. its a good economic eurogame that feels like an economic euro game. Once you get over the first few games and its paralyzing fear, its a very solid game.

Worker placement - **A Feast for Odin.** This game is so good. Even with all the praise I hear of this game I still wonder why i dont see more people talking about it. Especially with Norweigans, tweaking the balance of a few things this game is really a powerhouse, combining worker placement with engine building and spatial puzzle. Having so many paths that are all appealing and promising. 

Combat- **Star Wars: X-Wing 2.0**. The movement system feels so inspired. Learning to play with game, guessing what size template will fit where, predicting where your enemies are going to appear, it really made me feel like I was learning to fly the ships. After a few games I stopped hitting into asteroids all the time, started guessing my opponents moves, getting good shots. It was probably the best example of feeling growth in a game and seeing improvement. I am still trash but whatever,

4X- **Star Trek: Ascendancy:**  A recent acquisition of mine that immediately became my favourite empire building game. You feel like you command a section of space. The rules and the factions feel so thematic. The combat itself is very evocative. When trying to take over a planet you will often destroy a portion of all of the infrastructure raising all sorts of questions. The core loop is fundamentally simple, but the only issue is that our games seem to run about 5 hours long, meaning i wont be able to play it on weeknights.

Abstract/pure strategy - **Chess**  I dont have many abstract games but I would never be able to get rid of all of my chess boards. Too pretty. Too great of a game. Unfortunately its not a very fun game so I dont play it OTB (over the board) much. I am more likely to be doing chess tactics on my phone.

Tableau/engine builder - **Wingspan** It is without a doubt a pleasant game. I always enjoy running my engine and the game is beautiful as games comes. The real reason I would keep it is to show it to new games players. It really has a power to hook people, especially those who have not played dozens of other games. 

Deckbuilder - **The Quest for El Dorado**. Ill admit I dont have too many Deck building games but this one is great and was one of my first games when starting my collection. Very light hearted but also cut throat. Making your own maps is also quite fun.

Trick taking - **The Crew**. Assuming I also get a deck of cards then I would choose this 2019 gem. Instant classic for me. My parents play with me because it is no more complicated than their trick based games. When my copy has fallen apart completely I will probably get the new one.

Family/gateway - **Quacks of Quedlinburg**  a push your luck game that adds the tactile experience of reaching into a bag and feeling for your chips hoping and praying that the one you end up holding is not that big bad white chip that will make you bust. A game that rewards making bad and bold decisions. Easy to get people on board and such a heightened experience.

2p date night - **Memoir 44.** Most of these games are games I play on date night but this is our most played 2p game. This along with **Battlelore 2ed** which has some marked similarities. Fun and swingy and strangely educational. 

Roll-and-write equivalent - I would like to say **Railroad Ink**. Because I find it immensely satisfying and humbling to play. Every game has the round 5 realization of ""there are only 2 rounds left??"". Realistically I would keep **Welcome to** or **Welcome to New Las Vegas**, because my fiance loves those games and they are certainly fun. 

Party/conversational - **Wavelength.**  A beautiful game piece if ever I saw one. People love this game. It just gets people going. They dont need to have ever played a game before to get behind the concept. 

Bluffing - **Coup**. With the house rule ""Call your coup"" where you must declare what character you are couping this game really sings. I love the layered lies. Lying all game to then only be called out when you are telling the truth. The big reveals. Plus its so fast. Slowly I have converted my whole squad into thinking this game is great.

Cooperative - **Spirit Island** A big game with even bigger decision space. So thematic, so variable. I honeslty feel if I could only keep 1 game it would be this one because I could play it 1000 times and still be finding new interesting combos. Luckily for me my fiance loves it too.",,,1616981018,{},gsn2rz1,False,t3_mf00vj,False,True,t3_mf00vj,/r/boardgames/comments/mf00vj/if_you_could_only_have_1_game_of_each_genre_which/gsn2rz1/,1616981029,1,True,False,boardgames,t5_2qmjp,,0,[],
