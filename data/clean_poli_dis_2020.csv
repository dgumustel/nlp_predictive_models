PoliticalDiscussion,Evangelicals as a voting Bloc are tremendous hypocrites I m sure some of them are fine people but anybody who voted for Trump because it was the right moral choice is deluding themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What are you basing your opinion that rural Americans won t have sympathy for urban Americans   Literally everything that has happened since Nov    Donald Trump is nothing if not a vehicle for rural cultural and racial resentment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump could have easily coasted to re election if he showed the minimum amount of human decency and empathy The media grades him on a curve they would have showered him with praise if he did the bare minimum But of course being Donald Trump he can t  Jimmy Carter had a surge in approval rating during the hostage crisis Bush had  approval after   This is the easiest easiest layup handed to Trump on a silver platter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nice excuse for avoiding answering my objections Come back to me when you can come up with a decent response   gt You say Trump isn t taking it seriously but guess who s obstructing the stimulus bill The bi partisan stimulus negotiated by senate dems and republicans Hmm Not Trump or the Republicans Who could it possibly be  Oh Oh Oh I know Currently the  GOP senators who are threatening to block the bill because it helps poor people too much  
PoliticalDiscussion,How does it not makes sense they support a ban even if it s incest or rape They think it s a human life so they don t give a shit Besides the fact that the stereotypical right wingers views on rape are fucking abysmal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In July the group claimed that the medical procedure while  life changing for many families  wasn t  perfect    Not perfect is a far cry from  mass murder    People can say they believe anything If they don t act like they believe it and do thing that are logically consistent with a person who really believes it then they re lying 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not going to happen  The cult won t turn out for Pence  They know that  They are going down with Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry I couldn t even bother reading the whole thing after seeing this   gt The article says specifically that they were merged into other units of the National Security Council which of course has pandemic response as part of a numerous set of other responsibilities  So in other words they can respond to pandemics  Just not under a specific department for it  Just that pandemics aren t the only thing they do  Ok  You re clearly just trying to find ways to be upset for no reason so I won t bother debating anymore    You say Trump isn t taking it seriously but guess who s obstructing the stimulus bill  The bi partisan stimulus negotiated by senate dems and republicans  Hmm  Not Trump or the Republicans  Who could it possibly be  Dems can t even bother to rush this out and help people losing their jobs and you re nitpicking a guy who has a  approval rating for his handling of the virus 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I showed you two candidates that asked for open borders you dont accept the facts thats on you  You showed me AOC saying she doesn t support concentration camps and Beto campaigning in Mexico Neither of those show anyone calling for open borders
PoliticalDiscussion,I really don t agree There are no major underlying problems with the economy it s just on hold We need to bridge the gap from here to there and gov t loans can do that especially in the case of small businesses  Additionally the money directed at the airline industry is imperative That is a fully functional well operating industry that simply does not  and  should not  have the cash on hand to take a  month  or more break They need help covering overheads 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ironically Britain had the opposite problem At the end of WWI Britain owed a large amount of money to the USA but was also itself owed large debts by European wartime allies   Britain decided in the spirit of a new start to forgive the debts of its allies but the US refused to do the same and demanded to be paid in full Hence why Britain went from being the world s creditor nation to being heavily in debt Meanwhile the US was able to make a healthy profit from wartime loans and sales to Europe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah I get what you were trying to say now Still doesn t make sense that you d use the Holocaust as a unit but you do you  And even then your predictions are just as laughable Do you genuinely believe  million Americans will die 
PoliticalDiscussion,Youre removing your own context from the matter You said we would continue to deport them and we would fine them for coming here illegally and still deport them I asked you how do you fine them under your assumptions I didnt change my stances i asked you to back up yours  I showed you two candidates that asked for open borders you dont accept the facts thats on you  Now get your facts straight 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But this is why it should be left to medical professionals to talk about these things  We are in complete agreement then just thought that one distinction warranted comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let me be even more simple so you can really actually grasp this      died in the Holocaust    Half of   is     A Holocaust worth of deaths is    So a Holocaust  and a half is   deaths 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I said  A Holocaust and a half  Although the reality is that   the country actually can contract this at some point 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you clarified everything very well They often ignore it would require a distopian private police state 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Never  not even once  wavered in his worship of Putin  Picky a day or so after the Helsinki press conference with Putin in which Trump said he didn t see any reason why it would be Russia he backtracked and said mean meant why it  wouldn t be Russia Trump only kisses ass when in proximity of autocrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah Unless it makes them resent Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,Too bad the US doesn t have any sort of social safety nets in order to allow people to stay in for a number of weeks Hell alot of the people who are now unemployed have probably lost their health insurance and can t even get treated for the virus without dealing with a   bill Other countries are able to do lockdowns but for the US even what it s doing now with bare social distancing is considered too much for the American people to bear 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right man And he s also done a horrible job managing the coronavirus too right Also you completely ignored and will probably continue to ignore the fact that again Hilary Clinton was a garbage candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is stupid and then there is  this  The investigation paid for itself established clear links between the Trump administration and Russia and clearly stated that the Trump Administration had been obstructing justice in the aftermath of it getting out 
PoliticalDiscussion,You said  a half of Americans with little context except for the holocaust I don t think anyone here knows what you re talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t ignore anything You re ignoring what I just said as well as a  year  million dollar investigation into the Trump Russia collusion Tell me Hilary Clinton was a good candidate Say it  Edit Also since this  evidence is proven why is does Trump have his highest approval rating ever 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow you are ignoring the evidence that has been provided tabulated and collaborated by    several   intelligence agencies including the FBI CIA and NSA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hahaha thats so funny people are still on Russia Here s a fact Trump won less votes than Romney in Michigan and still won Face it Democracts lost  because they put up a garbage candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup That s what I mean by under control 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uh what 
PoliticalDiscussion,So some bars and restaurants in the UK before being ordered to close were complaining that without being explicitly told to close they couldn t claim insurance  so in effect they were having to stay open and lose loads of money running empty establishments because the gov wouldn t just say close 
PoliticalDiscussion,Belgium went without a government for  days nobody even noticed Congress is very small given the size of the USA so it is possible it will face the issues you raise   What will be interesting is if there is a lockdown in November  this might sound like too far away at the current lockdown but there was a more deadly second wave during the Spanish Flu pandemic I also expect the Democrats to complain about not being able to campaign effectively 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think his tweet will have any effect on the scientific community s direction regarding treatment whatsoever Now if people start hoarding those specific chemicals because of the tweet that s a different story 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would be fine with trump not giving any  expert advice on any topic  I do however think chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be an effective treatments for COVID   I d hate for a couple of fish tank cleaner consumers to keep those two drugs from being used in treating COVID  
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhhhhhh you do realize the population of the United States is quite a bit greater than died in the Holocaust do exactly what part of my post remotely suggests  million would die 
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually If there really was a God that can do anything he could stop this 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Partly false The Trump administration disbanded the  pandemic response team but some of the team members were reassigned to roles that included pandemic response    gt So in other words getting rid of that specific group or department but still keeping people that do the same thing under another department Okay  Perhaps the point wasn t clear enough for you There was NO PANDEMIC RESPONSE TEAM anymore The article says specifically that they were merged into other units of the National Security Council which of course has pandemic response as part of a numerous set of other responsibilities The fact that they re still working for the government doing other duties related to general security doesn t mean anything since the US no longer has a combined task force for addressing pandemics specifically Would be nice to have And given that they were appointed by Obama I bet they were alot more competent than the ragtag task force consisting of great health authorities like Mike Pence Steve Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow on the job the latter of whom wants the country to be open in a week or so  This is like saying that disbanding the members of a special nuclear response force is okay because they still have jobs in the military doing things that are related to national defense Hope that helps in the case of a nuclear strike or something   gt But let s put that aside Lets pretend he did do exactly what you said The Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Center for Healthy Security released a study last October asserting that the U S is the most prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic Source So apparently these  cuts didn t do much  Well that study of yours is really showing itself to be very accurate huh Places like Singapore and South Korea did better than places like the UK and Spain despite ranking lower than them  Of course I guess you could also say that Trump somehow bungled the response to the pandemic even though he had great infrastructure to do so which I m honestly willing to grant if it means anything I mean I guess great armies can lose battles if they re being led by incompetent generals   gt Yeah you re talking about a time where the media was saying it wasn t as bad as the flu Back when calling it the  Chinese Wuhan Virus wasn t racist Seems like forever ago huh You can take something seriously and downplay it publicly so people don t panic Stop pretending the two aren t mutually exclusive There wouldn t have even been a task force set up if it weren t taken seriously  He took it so seriously that there wasn t mass testing in place for months letting the virus spread and he s still not doing enough to send supplies to states that need it dragging his feet on implementing things like the Defense Production Act And he s so deadset on addressing the health crisis on the virus now that he s planning to reopen the economy after  days of weak social distancing recommendations which is apparently killing him inside   If not through his actions nor his words in what way is he taking it seriously If all that your argument for him being serious rests upon is the fact that Trump established an ineffectual task force that couldn t get the basic shit done in the first couple of months then I guess we both have different definitions of what that means 
PoliticalDiscussion,Millions of years of evolutionary survival instinct Culture is only a couple thousands years old and shifts on a dime Survival response is infinitely stronger 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump s entire Presidency and his campaign are based around being intentionally divisive Sure he didn t invent it he s just grabbed what the Republicans before him created and has deliberately tried to inflame that for his personal benefit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty much everyone that has interacted with him for any length of time and isn t in line for inheritance working for him or dependent on the Republican base liking them has said he s an absolute fucking moron  All the guys like Mattis Tillerson McMaster people that worked with him on The Apprentice foreign heads of state all agree he s real fucking dumb 
PoliticalDiscussion,At this point I m just going to say I regret my choice of words haha I ve had a number of responses like this and it s clear I made the mistake of over speaking what I meant   tl dr  Trump shouldn t be giving any medical advice or speaking in those terms whatsoever 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they think its murder why don t they protest for something that actually helps solve the problem Anti abortion legislation doesn t reduce abortions 
PoliticalDiscussion,And what the anti abortion activists largely miss is that anti abortion legislation doesn t actually stop abortion it just causes more people to die  If you want to reduce abortions there are better ways to do it they just refuse to listen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wait are you saying half of Americans are going to die or get sick Are you insane 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for that NZ s plan looks very similar to the United States  
PoliticalDiscussion,The BEST thing the US can do is take the proper medically necessary precautions first and foremost People dying over exerting hospitals   these are bad for the economy A healthy economy can be paused and in that pause the government inserts the cash that the market would have and then it unpauses when safe to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the reference 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump makes the problem worse But he didn t create divisiveness 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s reflecting what we all hope  that this is over soon  even if that is unlikely He did say we could have to do this longer Love or hate him he s  largely by his own fault in a damned if you do damned if you don t position If he says we re staying a lot longer people will accuse of power grabbing he keeps it too short then he doesn t care if people die It s absurd when the vast majority of either base cannot let the other side have a win  I m not count this as a win  that sentence is general commentary 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt One of his supporters died from ingesting the chemicals Trump touted as a magical cure   Trump s an  lt insert negative attribute gt but your statement is misleading at best  It is true that they consumed chloroquine phosphate but they did not take the FDA regulated chloroquine under a doctor s supervision but instead consumed fish tank cleaner that contained chloroquine phosphate  At no time did Trump or health officials suggest that fish tank cleaner was an option    Furthermore the difference between medicine and poison is the dosage  The fish tank cleaner probably didn t even indicate on the label the milligrams of chloroquine  That s bad because you can overdose on chloroquine which they did   Evidently they didn t know there is a correct amount to take on each day of the treatment    Whatever the outcome of the couple who thought it was a good idea to take fish tank cleaner just because it contained an unknown amount of a chemical does not change the likelihood that chloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Nobody protests outside of IVF clinics       gt It s about controlling women  Sure but that doesnt change the fact they believe it s murder This position may not be intellectually consistent or even coherent but they still hold it 
PoliticalDiscussion,He just a moron not one country will allow anything US made or people in or out    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Also you do realize that his administration fired the pandemic response team in  right You know established to counter situations like this   No  Reuters sourse      Partly false The Trump administration disbanded the  pandemic response team but some of the team members were reassigned to roles that included pandemic response     So in other words getting rid of that specific group or department but still keeping people that do the same thing under another department  Okay      But let s put that aside  Lets pretend he did do exactly what you said The Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Center for Healthy Security released a study last October asserting that the U S is the most prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic  Source    So apparently these  cuts didn t do much   gt Downplaying by definition isn t taking it seriously I don t know how you could say he s one but not the other It s like saying that I m livid but not angry Just word games  Yeah you re talking about a time where the media was saying it wasn t as bad as the flu  Back when calling it the  Chinese Wuhan Virus wasn t racist  Seems like forever ago huh  You can take something seriously and downplay it publicly so people don t panic  Stop pretending the two aren t mutually exclusive  There wouldn t have even been a task force set up if it weren t taken seriously 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s going to follow the Dow American presidents approval ratings are strongly tied to the economy He will always have the small unwavering base though Nothing will sway them 
PoliticalDiscussion,They hope for Ginsburg to die regularly I wouldn t hold your breath for their benevolence Their identity politics is so strong we might as well be North Korea to them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just hoping that leadership has the resolve to make the right decision despite the politicking  that we are already seeing come back again Making an unpopular decision is going to be a tough call at this point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Opened up on the coroner s table maybe   
PoliticalDiscussion,Sad that some Democrats will also be discounted from the electoral roll 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump hasn t stopped trying to win reelection because you know pending criminal charges No it s not feasible it s going to be months behind Easter that we could hope to get things back to  normal  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m going to respond to my own posting with some lightweight financial analysis   There are approximately  million Americans age   The CFR for this group is down in the     range  with good medical care  If this entire demographic became infected between K K will die  if we are able to provide them with good medical care   I don t have numbers on hospitalizations and ventilator requirements for that age group but here s a SWAG let s say that  require hospitalization of some sort and   require ventilators So we d need to be able to provide hospitalization for  million and ventilators for K over a four month period Assuming an average hospital stay of  weeks we d need to dedicate K hospital beds and need K ventilators This is completely doable for the fed govt if they made it a priority over the next two months  Nevertheless let s be clear  K people in the prime of their life dying of Covid is a terrible price to pay but there are clear benefits not only for America but for those in the  demographic   A lot of essential jobs outside the home are already being performed by people in this demographic but without the medical and financial safety nets This will be a huge benefit to those people   Everyone else in this cohort gets to go back to work and start making money   which they generally want to do   but with a far better financial   and medical   safety net than they would have sitting at home   There should be job opportunities for younger Americans that don t currently exist  especially for those in the CCC  because older Americans will be more likely to want to continue to self isolate and yet businesses need manpower to start cranking back up   Being able to work a job without having to pay for housing is a clear plus This is even more true for those in the CCC which may be able to demand even higher pay initially especially for working support roles in health care and frontline positions in service industries   Saving America   and especially the assess of older Americans   should rightfully impose a generational debt much as happened with Americans who fought in WWII the country should work toward giving this generation increased political and economic power Having said that I m sure they ll have to fight for it  The advantages for the country are clear   we work through herd immunity quickly by relying on our least impacted population to get infected which dramatically reduces   by perhaps        the overall death toll that would come from more infections in older Americans   we get the economy on its feet quickly by getting manufacturing and service businesses up and running quickly and by getting a population that both has money to spend and the ability to be in public to spend it  So what would this cost I m not even going to try to estimate the rapid hospital bed or ventilator construction costs since I frankly have no idea But for the remainder   If this entire  cohort worked outside the home and got infected the  K Covid deaths would cost the federal govt  billion in life insurance Perhaps we triple that to include older Americans who also chose to work outside the home but who have a higher CFR So roughly  billion   If the  million who required hospitalization incurred an average bill of  K that s an additional  billion Again maybe we double that to include Americans who are over  but are working outside the home so  billion   Let s say that all  million average two weeks out of work for Covid  and let s say that the average pay for those two weeks is  K that s another  K And again double that for older Americans so  K  So that s roughly  trillion from the federal govt and that assumes that literally everyone  is working outside the home  in practice it could be   of that  Far less than the   trillion being considered 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are those the gun toting bikey  para military type idiots who want to be Rambo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump in August after  million Americans have died from the virus and  million sickened Americans cannot find a hospital to accept them  Nobody expected the virus to be this bad I accept no responsibility  
PoliticalDiscussion,Gotta keep those evangelicals happy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Feasible   hahahahaha   
PoliticalDiscussion,One of those many mysteries like why don t pro lifers want to outlaw IVF as  mass murder and why don t pro lifers support all the things that are scientifically proven to reduce abortions   You think women don t want to control other women You think women are somehow above slut shaming and religious dogma and  I had to live with this bullshit so don t you dare try to change it to make it better for yourself  
PoliticalDiscussion,Infectious diseases do not care about political affiliation They don t care about race and ethnicity or how affluent you are If the  day lockdown was going to work that would mean everyone would need to lockdown As long as people are still having parties and going to the beach and getting people together for hikes  or even just not taking the recommended precautions while doing essential work or going to get staples there is still opportunity for spread I would love to have my kids back to school by Easter and go have a family gathering Do I think it s going to happen No way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dorothy mantooth is a saint you hear me 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t understand how that follows Incest and rape can be forgiven and murder cannot therefore incest and rape make murder okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s terrible that the morons that listen to the Orange disaster could end up dying   but that s also evolution at its finest  Stupid people that don t listen to reason will die and it is a shame but how do you convince a fanatic   you don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes you believe reality will be acknowledged by right wingers This is a culture war to them this defines their very existence they won t ever admit or acknowledge defeat
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump is good at playing the blame game Some would say he s the best even 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s almost like decades of right wing politics are coming to a head and bringing us to ruin 
PoliticalDiscussion,You seem to be under the impression that his business failing is a result of poor management in a Free Market Capitalist system and as such should be punished as you are also being punished I honestly cannot see a different way to interpret that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think she and a lot of other people believe that a president wouldn t go on tv and announce something like this to the public if it wasn t true Unfortunately we live in a time where we can t believe what our president is saying and it s putting the public s health at risk 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely feasible  This whole thing has been a bit overblown in the first place and the worst should be over next month 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess we will see  I hope you are right  I don t like Biden but would prefer him over any republican
PoliticalDiscussion,You would have said Kentucky but they re shifting bluer along the way    Wyoming is blue in   of the state even though it s pretty rural    Things are much more fluid  In  years when half the boomers silent are dead and the  year olds are  the  year olds are     many of these states you thought were locked red will be blue  And around that time the far left will split with the left and the Republicans will die off and join the moderate conservative Democrats   Unless we have ranked choice voting of course 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you work for any of the above people This sounds way to specific to be a general or random question 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but I would also factor in the degree of liberalism San Diego for example is very moderate overall Indianapolis is another example 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming is nowhere near flipping I believe it gave Trump his biggest margin of victory  something like  to Clinton s   Wyoming isn t just conservative it s the deepest red kind of  conservative  
PoliticalDiscussion,Unlikely As long as Democrats advocate unregulated immigration  both legal and illegal and promising benefits they have pretty much an unlimited supply of voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can guarantee Indiana will most likely stay red Indianapolis and South Bend isn t enough to carry the state and it seems as if southern Indiana close to Louisville KY is growing more red by the day There s a lot of people in Jeffersonville Clarksville and New Albany which would kill any kind of blue momentum from the northern cities 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s also going to be real hard for biden if they have debates and he will have health questions over him the whole campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,South Florida I m liberal and I swear this place is getting more conservative by the year 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt apples to oranges  But you can still compare them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming  We just aren t appealing to your typical  leftists in numerous ways and we don t have a lot of the facilities resources culture and infrastructure that those type of folks prefer  and in some cases require   We appeal to a lot of Libertarians which may eventually push  some   social  politics left but I just can t see this state ever turning  purple in the traditional mixed D R sense  A lot of people say  well it happened to Colorado and is happening to Montana    but it s still comparing apples to oranges  There s nothing here to spur a rapid enough population growth anywhere in the state to start us down the same path  Even our major populatuon centers and tourist traps aren t experiencing much growth  and have actually gone backwards at certain points recently for various reasons   Our population retention is terrible and that s not going to change 
PoliticalDiscussion,It ll be very interesting to see what the electoral landscape looks like if the leftward march of the sun belt continues   If Dems win Arizona and Texas they could lose the entire rust belt Florida and Minnesota and still win the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Iron Range in upstate Minnesota is also blue more often than red 
PoliticalDiscussion,And isn t Wyoming trying to drive their own tech boom The state has so few people that any mediocre tech job could change the state  Or an I thinking of those parts about how Bloomberg could flip winning by just paying for people to move there 
PoliticalDiscussion,NC went for Obama in 
PoliticalDiscussion,as others have mentioned your cousin could go to a myriad of states pretty much any throughout the great planes or the south   but to answer your question other issues besides domestic migration for your cousin is the declining birthrate of white Americans currently at   less than half what it would have to be to maintain current numbers of whites and the high numbers of immigrants that want to come to the United States from abroad Non whites favor democrats in every state and so this article   shows just how fast states are becoming  majority minority  with all but Wyoming the Dakotas Montana and Idaho being solid red states not expected to become minority white in the next  years and with the country overall becoming minority white by    A lot can happen in that time obviously like a change in demographic patterns or Republicans attracting more non whites to their positions Just looking at race also obviously doesn t account for everything But those are the most solid states for your cousin to live in if he wants to stay somewhere safely and solidly conservative 
PoliticalDiscussion,And OKC usually has a liberal mayor
PoliticalDiscussion,you showed bernie saying he would decriminalize border crossings which is again very different from open borders castro said the same thing at the end of the day we are disagreeing about whether decriminalizing the border while still deporting people can be considered open borders it s literally not open borders as opposed to what freedom of movement actually looks like but you dogmatically stick to your beliefs anyway
PoliticalDiscussion,Suburbs have begun to start trending blue however The migration of college educated voters into the Democratic party might be able to turn some states that don t have major urban areas more blue if this trend continues  it s how Virginia went from a state that hadn t gone blue since Truman to a solid Democratic state  While more rural states might stay red the suburbs truly becoming blue would put put states like North Carolina and Arizona in the more solidly blue column 
PoliticalDiscussion,Likely We ll see if the disaster flag rally holds to November 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also post Trump the suburbs rapidly turned blue They were one of the biggest factors in the  House Blue Wave  
PoliticalDiscussion,What Off the top of my head there have been  economic downturns in the last  years and only  of those have been during elections and both those elections a Democrat won  Clinton in  and Obama in  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not really a  problem per se it s the Democratic Party realizing its identity Many moderates were more than willing to throw their weight behind the progressives but when the youth vote didn t show up to back policies that overwhelmingly favored them the pragmatic voters of the party decided very quickly they weren t reliable and quickly shifted to fully back the center   The jury s still out about whether the factory worker in the rust belt will back Biden But that s absolutely his play And TBH it s Trump s play too 
PoliticalDiscussion,You must not know too many Republicans Trump has  approval from within the Republican party and nationwide his approval is   according to  At least right now the GOP is fairly united around Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,So Trump wins again  
PoliticalDiscussion,Parties and geographic areas are always in constant realignment Parts of the south and southwest are becoming more friendly to Democrats while parts of the industrial midwest are becoming more friendly to Republicans Trump won Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin and he nearly won Minnesota and New Hampshire as well   Dems can look at states like Arizona Georgia North Carolina and Texas as targets over the next  or so years but the GOP can look at states like MI WI PA OH and NH as targets as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas has too many large cities that are growing rapidly Dems get closer and closer each statewide election  No way it stays red into the s In  Beto Dem lost to Cruz  Rep   to     The only thing keeping Texas red is the vast expanse of small towns and rural areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Three criteria for a successful Republican migration   The state is very white well above the national average  The white population of that state by and large did not go to college and isn t going to college in any significant numbers  The state has no significant population growth Better yet the population is declining  Based on that criteria I m going to say the best bet for such a person that you re describing would be   West Virginia  Edit Also I m not saying any of this to be insulting to anyone I m merely saying that these criteria are generally what makes up Republicans in America  white people whose highest level of education is high school 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is unlikely we see any impact at all While there has been a lot of anecdotal talk of this effect there is little evidence that the moment is coming with any actual weight People aren t moving in the amounts that matter  Plus the red counties are Vast So the effect is also greatly dispersed The only one that Might have impact is Puerto Rican refugees that have permanently moved to Florida That could cause some shifts in what is already an unstable state depending on voting laws it might even make Florida reliably blue though their last election was Packed with weird voting issues so it might just be out of play entirely  As for the reverse There is both an economic and a psychological barrier to established red voters moving to blue cities A lot of motion actually does happen out of red territory and it is mostly young people leaving the dead ends of their towns and heading to cities for work But largely these people don t vote and when they do they vote blue  For reliably red voters to head to cities they would need to be able to afford to do so and with how impoverished most red towns are that is a Tall order Add onto that most Republican voters value tradition highly Moving to a city most likely means abandoning those traditions and social circles On top of that tactically land grab is where they have their power weakening that even a little is detrimental to their ability to win elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,And even the most conservative states tend to have blue urban centers  Jackson isn t what you d call progressive but it leans blue pretty hard  Same with Birmingham and definitely in Atlanta 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well Trump is going to get re elected  I m not a Trump Supporter but I ve gotten used to the guy  I did that by getting off social media because his supporters are toxic  I also stopped watching cable news because they are sensational in their exploitation of covering the guy  America has seen worse like Herbert Hoover Nixon debatably G W Bush who created two wars we had a surplus before then  So honestly I focus on state and local  Even our governor calls our state of California a Nation State  Honestly I m not a stakeholder there is nothing government can do to ruin or enhance my life  And again any bad decisions economically or militarily this guy makes will effect Red States more than Blue States  I m grateful not to be in a Red State  My only concern right now is with the toilet paper hoarders  OK if the economy is destroyed by this guy I fear people will panic and pandemonium and anarchy will arise  I know a lot of people in California are rethinking their gun stance again that is why Red States have so many guns they grew up with a community of toilet paper hoarders they know the dark side of man more than some Suburbanite in a Coastal city  Shits survival there  I myself am a religious man and would never purchase a gun  Again I m Blue State religious so that logic makes sense to me Red State religious state I should own a gun  The cultures don t mix  Read Jack Kerouac and look at the painting American Gothic shit there doesn t change 
PoliticalDiscussion,colorado was traditionally pretty red but growth and migration of denver slowly turned it blue i see idaho going the way of colorado if boise s growth continues
PoliticalDiscussion, gt TBF both parties are facing tension between the moderate center and the extreme elements in each  This is absolutely true There are real populist factions within both parties that started rearing their heads around   The RNC managed to sort of placate right wing populism because the party didn t step in to throw the weight of the entire machine against Trump in the primary in the same way the DNC did Of course the RNC did try just not nearly as effectively as the DNC did and some of the RNC rules from  would have prevented a super delegate coup in the primary So Trump gets elected on a populist wave   The DNC s problem is coming to a head now because it was slapped down in  and it s only grown in antipathy towards establishment Democrats Even if the midterm wins failed to materialize Muh Blue Wave was significant but still almost  seats fewer than the  house flip from Dem to Rep And of those seats which flipped from D to R none were Justice Democrats or any flavor of further left Those  Justice Democrat candidates won in safe blue seats In AOC s case her primary opponent didn t even campaign and primary turn out was extremely low 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not think that Democrats are turning Red areas Purple I think they are just Occupying their small Blue districts with more and more people essentially giving them increasing voting powers Hence why every big city district in every Red state is still Blue 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt during recessions people tend to vote for Republicans Republicans viewed as better with money and at helping the economy  Do you have an actual data source for this Because the biggest recession of my lifetime was in  and it resulted in a democratic president a supermajority in the senate and the largest house majority held by any party since  
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the correct answer  The Democrat Republican divide is rural vs urban  There aren t any major cities that vote republican  Oklahoma City is the largest Republican dominant city and is rank  in population Even the most liberal states will usually have staunchly conservative small town rural areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,That would be nice to see I don t know which would shrivel up and die  of the three parties but I d suspect the GOP simply due to age attrition 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly every Republican I know has totally given up because of Trump They are upset because they can t trust Fox and how all of this is happening when Trump and Fox were clearly lying to them     People who were proud full on always vote nothing but Republican are questioning if they should just not vote this election They re scared about getting sick because their insurance sucks and they are scared for their jobs They talked about Dems blocking the recovery bill but when they learn that Dems basically made and charged the bill up her help to everyone first and then work on the bigger stuff later they flat out duck out    I m sure if Trump loses the election Republicans will treat Trump like they did Bush By pretending he never happened and go back to blaming Democrats for everything   Yes they are that level of brainwashed 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no point trying to win over the hard red areas they re a lost cause for the time being since their belief system isn t rooted in the advantages or disadvantages and they re okay being harmed by their chosen leaders You don t reason with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,TBF both parties are facing tension between the moderate center and the extreme elements in each I would not be the least bit surprised to see the center being carved out of both parties to form a third In fact since the progressives seem to have wilted in the primaries this is what Biden s play will likely be The GOP will become the party of the far right Democrats will be the center moderates and the social Democrats will occupy the progressive left 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oklahoma
PoliticalDiscussion,He could move to ND SD Wyoming UT WV MS AL I don t see any of those states going blue Stay away from MN It seems red but isn t because of Minneapolis 
PoliticalDiscussion,never heard the word aughties     Man do I feel old
PoliticalDiscussion,States without major urban areas Those metropolitan areas tend to be blue and can turn an entire state blue just through sheer numbers Like Illinois is pretty red outside of Chicago but Chicago is freaking huge It s why Georgia and Texas will be blue within a decade they have major cities that will soon outweigh the rural areas  But i don t see Mississippi ever being blue Or Oklahoma South Carolina Wyoming Probably a dozen others States that just don t have any very large cities to dominate them will probably be safe red for the foreseeable future 
PoliticalDiscussion,The economy has already tanked and people are already losing their jobs and his ratings are rising Arguably the unemployment rate is at its peak because we will probably start slowly opening up sectors of the economy soon Currently the unemployment rate is exceeding the unemployment rate during the great depression   during recessions people tend to vote for Republicans Republicans viewed as better with money and at helping the economy while Democrats are viewed as better at dealing with social justice issues  Not to mention that Trump has already proven to be good at improving markets   The left is currently f      up more than Trump Nancy pelosi s little stunt this weekend was head bangingly awful The left is doing its normal thing and trying to find any possible reason to make Trump look bad Including apparently blaming Trump because a couple decided to eat fish tank cleaner But it s not fooling anyone   I think if one of these  treatments we are looking at ends up working or being effective at least  Several of them look very promising This whole thing will be over way sooner than it s we thought and it will guarantee his presidency 
PoliticalDiscussion,He walked off the stage at a different event after this comment and called them illegal aliens  wasn t talking about the rating s just your predictions
PoliticalDiscussion,NV and NM have voted Democratic in the last  presidential elections AZ is getting bluer But ID and much of TX are pretty red 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you want a longer look at this phenomenon take a look at the Big Sort a book by Bill Bishop that came out in the mid aughties 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem now is that the Democratic Party is too divided and burdened with infighting to be able to even begin to think about appealing to hard red areas As has been said in this thread already polarization will only continue to get worse and the fact that the Democrats have trouble appealing to all of their own base does not bode well for red areas turning purple 
PoliticalDiscussion,A sensible take  The proof in the pudding is in the eating so when this all resolves is going to tell us the long term take  Though this will be complicated because we re going to keep up all of this social distancing for at least  months keeping these events at the forefront of our minds  edit phrase correction
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel that swing voters that actually decide an election will wait until the th hour It will largely depend on body counts and stock gains more than any other indicator Call it what you will the stock market decides many folks feelings regardless of their own participation in the market Trump isn t the first to tie himself to that metric but it has been the hill he decided to live or die upon If enough big swingers feel he handled that market well then the swing voters will get in lime It s also a soft cushion for liberals to swing at as the biggest movers in the virus response were governors and they are only v gor good actors being democracts Enough republican governors are responding well that it blunts the effects of party attack ads 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think if the treatment they re looking at works it will guarantee his presidency
PoliticalDiscussion,According to polls  Biden and Bernie did about the same   with people saying that Biden did a little bit better  But like why are you responding to two week old comments 
PoliticalDiscussion,Arizona and North Carolina would be the least surprising states to flip for the first time in a while 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think people are rallying to the flag right now We aren t anywhere near   levels yet or anything like that   If Trump can parlay this tinge of goodwill into the perception he handled this crisis well it ll certainly help him in November  That being said a lot of this is too early We still haven t ironed out the economic ramifications and the pandemic is still running its course  Another point I ve seen made is that if this is the ceiling of a rally to the flag crisis for Trump it s not good for him  I ve seen some brutal attack ads with the contradictory statements and horrible timeline of things he has said If Democrats were good at messaging they would be blasting them out more than they are   tl dr  still too early to really know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it depends on how much money your hypothetical cousin has  A lot of the Blue States are the centers of wealth especially when you talk about the West Coast the New England area and the Tri State Region  These places are becoming more expensive to live in and hence people tend to move out of state looking for a cheaper place to live with a comparable way of life  I m from California and I hear people have been moving out of California to Idaho Arizona Nevada New Mexico and Texas  All those places are solid Red States  Again they move there because they can no longer afford California which is overpopulated and are looking for something cheaper with a comparable way of life  So for your hypothetical family member he can move to the South or the Midwest  Places like Missouri Tennessee West Virginia or Oklahoma Utah Nebraska  Again there are places to go in this country if you are a Republican and don t like the direction your state is going  But it all depends on how much money your hypothetical relative has and what kind of skill sets he has  I think with this whole online and social networking people are realizing their experience of America isn t the same based on region  I wouldn t go to any Red State myself  Thankfully I don t have to  Again I never understand why Conservatives would call Liberals Authoritarian  I think the reason the Red States say that is because they don t live by the same values as the Blue States so any suggestion which may be made towards Blue States may be oppressive to them  Again for a long time the media was seen from the Perspective of the Blue State  That s no longer the case the Blue is starting to see the Media from the perspective of the Red State  The Blue Stater shouldn t be so frightened just don t move there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Overall things are becoming more geographically polarized not less There are lots of areas that have become more red over the past few years Most states that Trump won by a significant margin particularly rural or exurban parts of those states  urban areas tend to be blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t kid yourself The reason why Trump and a growing number of Republicans are talking about  go back to work don t let the cure be worse than the disease is because they think the disease is going to affect mostly blue cities and that  real Americans should not be punished to save the lives of  coastal elites   We have eyes and ears We know what it means when they say  coastal elites and  real Americans over and over again We know that as long as the disease isn t well into red America territory Republicans and their voters wouldn t lift a finger   gt Both parties are being too divisive right now  This is some classic  both sides false equivalency bs 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Trump s original tweet presented information out of context  Probably He s not exactly good at communicating technical information   gt and led to those people doing something stupid  Partially led I just dispute this recent narrative which I ve seen all over the place lately that Trump hyped up a miracle cure and thereby killed this unfortunate person 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump The Ides of Corona have come political polls  Political Polls Aye Caesar but they have not gone  This crisis is no where near started Once the bodies start stacking polls may still shift 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s still early and most people arent too affected by this yet Once people s families start getting infected and dying and Trump keeps acting this way things aren t going to last Same thing if the economy tanks and people lose their jobs
PoliticalDiscussion,Given how things are shaping up i would predict a result largely along the lines of  but perhaps a larger turnout especially if vote by mail becomes a nationwide thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,That bitter terrible people aren t going to pick up the ball and help society 
PoliticalDiscussion,The premise of the question is wrong  Trump would of course like the entire country to open for business and if possible he would work towards that date However he never said it that the entire country would be re opened He mentioned that some areas like   fly over states have very little virus activity and it may be possible to re open some of the country in sections Besides at this point everyone is guessing how this will develop  It s possible things will get much worse and the virus may spread to even more of the country or the mitigation steps might contain it  No one knows if tomorrow or next week scientists will come up with a treatment or cure for the virus that will turn everything upside down   Is Trump concerned with his re election prospects naturally as any politician is right now However he understand the damage this is having on the country as a whole  Entire industries employing millions are teetering on going under No American wants to go back to    The lives of real people of all colors ages religions and even political persuasions are being severely affected  He is right in saying that the longer we stay closed the harder it will be to re start things The law of inertia also applies to the economy    The one thing we must ALL learn from this is that we cannot be dependent on one source for key items and materials In a bi partisan manner politicians should move to mandate the manufacturing of critical items and medicines here in the US  Maybe not  but at least  and make sure no one country is producing more than  of our needs  Supply chains for medicines and medical equipment has to be diversified  Let China continue to make toys household good and all the cheap products 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Way too old
PoliticalDiscussion,I so agree
PoliticalDiscussion,Not every rural person is white and not every rural person supports Trump  Turn off the TV and don t fall for the narrative the media is pushing  Granted I m rural white and vote Republican but I can t imagine not helping any part of the country if they are in need  I don t know if you re old enough to have been an adult on   but people in rural areas lined up to give blood money and to send resources to New York and Washington   Both parties are being too divisive right now  Don t fall for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,We also basically need a lockdown to get to the point where doing that is viable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not every rural person is white and not every rural person supports Trump  Turn off the TV and don t fall for the narrative the media is pushing  Granted I m rural white and vote Republican but I can t imagine not helping any part of the country if they are in need  I don t know if you re old enough to have been an adult on   but people in rural areas lined up to give blood money and to send resources to New York and Washington   Both parties are being too divisive right now  Don t fall for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we institute a  day isolation period this model suggests that  million people could contract the coronavirus across the United States between January and late October  with  million at the peak on May   More than  million people would die under these conditions  so you are right in this hypothetical death rate about   and  million people would recover       The death rate will fluctuate a little bit depending on how much we flatten the curve 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like this will be a soft opening This benefits small businesses who are taking a hit of course but this also is highly risky I m sure this will be negotiated to either a limited opening or none at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Showed bernie and castro both saying for open borders but you chose to ignore them i see 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree and I don t agree that evangelicals consider abortion mass murder I think it s more about controlling woman and punishing woman for having  irresponsible sex  It s amazing how many of these pro lifers are now willing to die for the stock market all of the sudden 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I mean if u think it s murder then exceptions don t make sense
PoliticalDiscussion,Without a complete lockdown and prevention There will too many moving parts at any one time with a risk no matter where 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Not only are blue collar whites a smaller share of the electorate than in  they also behave differently As American University political scientist David Lublin notes  The early s were the height of weak partisanship with voters much more willing to defect from their party in elections than today  Back then Democrats were less homogenously liberal Lots of whites with fairly conservative views on race gender and national security still identified with the party So ideologically voting for Reagan wasn t much of a stretch   Since then however American politics has witnessed a massive ideological  sorting  The kind of conservative blue collar whites who would once have been  Reagan Democrats are now mostly Republicans As The Washington Post s Phillip Bump notes working class whites are almost  percentage points more likely to identify with the GOP than they were in  Those blue collar whites who remain Democrats are more liberal It may be because they re members of unions and thus more sympathetic to a pro government message It may be because they re Millennials who even in the white working class tend to be more secular more pro gay marriage and less racially resentful than their parents and grandparents It may because they are women who are somewhat more liberal than men overall     The point is that because of this  sorting  notes Emory s Alan Abramowitz  Party ID  now predicts vote choice very well  In  Mitt Romney won Republicans  to  percent Obama won Democrats  to  percent Not many people cross party lines in presidential elections anymore    There was a flip in Dixiecrats to Republicans  Trent Lott etc  we re kicked out of the Democratic Party for being racist  The Democrats that switched parties back then did so because they were segregationist Republicans and Democrats weren t willing to keep them as Democrats anymore  That s all sorted now  There are very few Joe Manchin Democrats in swing states and no Trent Lott Democrats in any state 
PoliticalDiscussion,You do realize that would make sense Even logical Two things this administration and Trump supporters lack Let alone understand 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cue dad with belt meme
PoliticalDiscussion,Not even fascist This is what happens when we find have a purge every four years It wasn t a movie but a blueprint for thinning out the herds of mass stupid 
PoliticalDiscussion,They always want the D so why not
PoliticalDiscussion,Welcome to America where the leaders are stupid and or president is a sentient can if spray on tan Sanding times we live in  s
PoliticalDiscussion, Why flip one state when you can flip    
PoliticalDiscussion,Screw people that like things the way they are Change for the sake of change 
PoliticalDiscussion,can confirm boatloads of people are moving here into Texas from California more than any other state I am aware of
PoliticalDiscussion,The Rust Belt MI WI PA swings back blue along with Iowa and Arizona We might see North Carolina and Florida flip as well but that s largely it for map changes The idea that Trump wins the  rust belt states again is highly unlikely considering his super razor thin margin of victory there in  against a historically unpopular opponent and having to run on a scandal filled record and in a potential recession Because the virus is not expected to fade for quite some time and I have trouble seeing Trump somehow form a competent response already talking about reopening the country by Easter which would lead to thousands more dead and with the economy faltering further because of that and a recession likely in that event Trump loses easily and states like GA and TX come into play 
PoliticalDiscussion,it s not fair to say they don t  vote republican  They don t vote as MUCH The divide is small in many cases  Houston is the th largest city in America and only leaned blue by  in the  presidential election 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Young people oscillated between Republican and Democrat until recently The ones that hated Nixon and Republicans didn t switch over there were plenty of  year olds back then that voted R  Millions of Democrats voted for Reagan at that time it s why he was able to win reelection while carrying  states 
PoliticalDiscussion,for the first time in my life I considered going out to buy a gun in case mob mentality breaks out  then our sheriff closed down all the gun shops aa  non essential     this makes me feel like I need a gun even more now
PoliticalDiscussion,You would say he s more progressive than Obama Some of his proposals may be but his rhetoric and record don t quite match up I m interested to see how that shakes out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Coronavirus might cause those cities to reduce in population one way or another
PoliticalDiscussion,That might be indicative of this particular electoral period rather than a long term trend 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I d really like to see that come to fruition and see what factors contribute to geopolitical growth of a city progressive or conservative
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t bet on San Diego being moderate going forward It s true they  we currently have a Republican mayor but party membership and local elections are trending strong blue with increasingly liberal candidates Politics are changing in that city 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there might be a certain appeal to building up a new progressive community from scratch 
PoliticalDiscussion,It could but the turnaround on developing and distributing new drugs is such that well likely already be through the peak of a sharp or flattened curve before they become widely available It would take a miracle at this point on par with winning the lottery for us to not see a completely overwhelmed healthcare system and a seven figure death toll 
PoliticalDiscussion,It also gives us time to develop discover effective drug treatment This could massively push down the mortality rate as well as shorten ICU stays 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shouldn t significant changes in population affect the number of electoral votes the state represents 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Trump is basically thinking that he has a better chance to win reelection running against mass death than he does running against the economy that his mismanagement of the Coronavirus ruined  I don t think the economy is ruined specifically because of the mismanagement of the response to the pandemic Look at Germany their response has been widely lauded but small companies are already starting to fold some bigger ones too the DAX is in freefall  A lot of companies cannot hold out for  months without income and this is a phenomenon all over the world 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lower taxes are priorities to conservatives though so it s more cyclical than that The rural areas are redder and therefore republican policies such as low taxes are common 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is generally true but the trend that should be concerning for Republicans is the suburbs As GOP loses more and more white college educated voters the suburbs become more and more blue or purple   Pair that with decreasing rural population and increased city population and we are already seeing states like Colorado Virginia and Arizona turn blue The urban rural areas have stayed largely the same while the suburbs have turned purple from red 
PoliticalDiscussion,The main driver actually isn t the cities  It is the taxation and cost of living that is driving this  The red states are just cheaper to live in and to retire to  People living in major cities which are way more expensive to live in than rural red states want to get the fuck out of the cities when they retire  And they want their retirement dollars to go as far as possible  So the move to states where their retirements will last a long while  Ad the red states are the states where that is possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hello from Tennessee 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kentucky Both the perception of Kentucky  we re all dumb hillbillies barefoot and pregnant all most of us are coal miners etc and the conservative politics will keep most Dems from wanting to settle here It s viewed largely as a lost cause Same would apply to places like Alabama and Mississippi 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Joe Biden wins the national vote by  points he loses He has to win by a more significant margin 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s disgusting
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He s the most progressive general election candidate we have ever had  In anyone s lifetime sure but he isn t FDR
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends on how well he campaigns here but also on the state Anecdotally I live in Michigan  and actually know a couple Obama Trump voters who are probably voting third party or abstaining this year  The feeling I get is that the hardcore Trump base is still around but a lot of the  silent soft Trump voters were basically independents who aren t happy with either party s establishment and given that Biden s an establishment figure I don t know that Obama Trump voters would go for him as a bloc I think Biden should be focused on turnout more than anything else Michigan has a pretty big population and still leans blue as a state Clinton s biggest issue in  was turnout and she was  extremely unpopular here in ways that Biden won t be So as long as Biden campaigns well and the Dem base is energized he should be able to win MI and MN somewhat comfortably I think WI will be hard as it s much whiter less populated and more rural than MI MN are  All that said Biden s platform should address the following things a wealth tax ACA expansion student debt relief easing the trade war with China and investment in rural infrastructure These are winning positions among a wide swath of voters  including the wealth tax  He should de emphasize immigration and social issues to the extent that he can obviously he ll need to affirm stances on abortion gun rights visa laws DACA amnesty etc but those should not be the primary focus of his campaign Biden should probably also reiterate that Obama era policies caused a lot of the economic growth under Trump tl dr the Midwest has a ton of economic anxiety and a winning platform for Biden is to address that anxiety 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not in any way that matters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t fixing gerrymandering be more efficient 
PoliticalDiscussion,The American dream has always been sort of a grey area swindle  Small  or all businesses rely on the consumer being a wasteful idiot and they go out of their way advertising and pressuring consumers to spend as much as possible  Of course the terms become nicer  Supporting local businesses  It all goes belly up the moment people watch what they spend instead of blindly charge their credit cards 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe that this recent attitude on reddit and Twitter that Democrats are only good for social justice and believe in nothing else is just a media bubble thing I ve seen little to no evidence that most Democrats Americans actually believe this   I think the younger generations particularly those on social media underestimate how moderate to right wing most Democratic voters are The  impotence seems to be more or less what their voters want for the time being though things like MA and maybe even UBI will become more popular as time goes on judging by how many voters under  approve of them compared to older cohorts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Itll effect   either way distancing only slows down the rate  flatten the curve so that instead of  patients for every ICU bed it s only   I dont think the reality of how bad the next few weeks are going to be has really sunk in yet with most people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it s a good thing for Biden s chances in PA that he was Pennsylvania s third senator 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Landlords get to operate as business as normal especially when they  should have the capital to weather a delay in rent payment and they don t really offer much to the local economy in the short term  Pretty much that s why they got into the landlord business to begin with  Less risky passive income which competes against other forms of passive income 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it might actually help him get reelected 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of wealthy retired people in those areas like him or  the democrats forced me to vote for him types
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a lie   Young people oscillated between Republican and Democrat until recently  The ones that hated Nixon and Republicans didn t switch over there were plenty of  year olds back then that voted R    There majority of  year olds have voted D for  decades now  And they re not switching as they get older just as they historically have not  The boomers parents voted Democrat they are the last generation of Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fair enough I support your line of inquisitive thinking But hope your underlying questioning is in the support of the common person 
PoliticalDiscussion,Daily briefings where people can watch snippets and interpret that as presidential during a crisis can be helpful to temporarily boost ones popularity As the problem gets worse and there is time to reflect on why thats when popularity goes down  His handling of the coronavirus is easily one of his most obvious weaknesses when exposed correctly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well most deportations are already civil not criminal So are you asking me how the existing law already works The whole point of decriminalizing border crossings is that the deportations that are still criminal just become criminal as well We re already doing it we just aren t doing it  of the time most deportations are already civil so yes people are being deported without being criminally charged How is this hard to wrap your head around 
PoliticalDiscussion,It d go a long long way in taking back the senate and it d be one of the cheapest states to possibly swing 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would characterize the Ds differently They are a diverse coalition not divided The GOP is almost exclusively white older and rural The GOP appears united simply because the white older and rural vote has coalesced around the GOP   The two parties are by their nature different 
PoliticalDiscussion,In my humble opinion  All places tend to shift towards the left ever so slightly as we move further and further into the future So in that sense maybe you as an individual can migrate to a more conservative area and enjoy most of your life without too much shifting in terms of the political landscape but even then as you get old you would notice some change I think the best thing republicans conservatives can do is to evolve rather than constantly move Conservatives will remain relevant in this country as long as they can innovate in terms of their policy platforms while staying true to some of their most important values and principles 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Trump was smart to listen to his health team of advisors and shut off travel from infected countries early on  Trump shut off travel to the countries that he had ideological beef with then sat back like it was job done   Remind us again how well that stopped that virus from spreading in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,And the inverse Salt Lake City is a huge liberal area absolutely contrary to the rest of Utah 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see Democrats turning MI WI and PA and perhaps even NC and AR OH and IA are trending red so winning there is not going to be easy at all Florida is as much of a tossup as ever and Biden is the strongest candidate there out of everyone that ran in the primaries it just seems like that last  of people there or so just don t like voting Democrat for whatever reason The Dems probably keep hold of NH NV VA and CO It ll be more difficult to hold MN and ME since these states nearly went for Trump in  
PoliticalDiscussion,the  senators would be the real prize
PoliticalDiscussion,It would also be low return on investment since Wyoming is only  electoral votes 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt People under  that hate everything the Republican Party stands for wont go Republican with a face lift They ll never vote Republican in their life that ship has sailed  You re extremely optimistic  Young people hated Nixon s ass and voted for Reagan happily less than a decade later 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re asking for areas that always stay blue I couldn t give you an entire state because most liberal states have very diverse populations But I will say Berkeley San Fran will probably remain the liberal hub for a while 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok you just said it you dont get arrested so how do you deport someone if you cant detain them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh absolutely That s not the argument It s their population They have sick a small population that a focused migration could flip the state easily The  election meme around this is basically that Bloomberg could have spent the same amount of money to permanently flip Wyoming instead of all of the campaign ads that amounted to nothing for him  MATH  Their total population is   Voting population was  in  Of that population only  are registered to vote Of those only  people voted  Given a   split So  people voted for Clinton  voted for Trump For a difference of  votes  Let s say we round that up to an even  to lock the vote in  m was spent by Bloomberg for his campaign He could have  to  to move to Wyoming  I mean it d take way more than that to get me to move to Wyoming so I don t think that math checks out But investing m into building a tech hub in Wyoming would result in the same effect 
PoliticalDiscussion,My nontraditional and pretty far left family has been looking at Wyoming lately   Pretty and clean as you say The internet and cheap travel makes living in a big city less important than it once was 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden isn t really that moderate  He s the most progressive general election candidate we have ever had 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the new Manhattan 
PoliticalDiscussion,Find one Democratic platform that supports unregulated immigration   This is Fox News fiction designed to scare low info voters 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt s long as Democrats advocate unregulated immigration  both legal and illegal  Would you mind pointing to where that s a policy that Democrats advocate for 
PoliticalDiscussion,Probably both with a slight edge towards Biden but not by enough to swing the balance of the general election
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Talking points of diversity measurements  It s easy to find a way to trigger them that will deflect from the actual substance of the Bill which is helping people rather than helping Wall Street 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting I m in west palm beach and live two minutes away from trump and people hate him here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Man just imagine a presidential election in the next decade where Dems win the northeast the rustbelt the west coast AND Texas Talk about a landslide 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re turning purple because the Republicans are turning people away from their party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming is a beautiful state that has plenty to attract someone who wants to visit Yellowstone or the Tetons but yeah   From a coastal perspective there s no work and you wouldn t really want to live there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Immigrants cannot vote in most elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,That won t work    People under  that hate everything the Republican Party stands for wont go Republican with a face lift They ll never vote Republican in their life that ship has sailed    That s not every Democrat but it s enough of them and we re a big enough majority under  that when it s under  in  years they ll cease to be viable 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know I checked and I m actually wrong Republicans are more likely to serve during recessions but are more likely to be elected when confidence in markets is high Recessions are more likely to happen under republican presidents because they are usually elected at a peak 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t like to give out too much personal information online but I think I m a fair bit younger than you think I take your comment as a compliment though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump got   of the vote in  Clinton got   Gary Johnson got   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s also possible the parties will switch again  obviously not on social issues but maybe economic A right wing populist who isn t outwardly anti immigrant and plays to the working class and gets disaffected Bernie supporters can build upon Trump s coalition and turn the Republican party into an economic left social right party whereas a Democratic party that keeps playing for suburban and educated voters will probably continue moving towards social left economic center or even economic right in some cases I think it would take a very long time for that to happen completely but it would almost lead us to a complete reversal of the  s Democrats and Republicans which switched on social issues in the  s but not economic and now may switch on economic issues but not social   And by economic left and right here I guess I m meaning left as populism and right as neoliberal for which there is some overlap with traditional economic left right in terms of government interventionism   If democrats want to win long term they have to find a way to simultaneously satisfy progressives working class people of all races and neoliberals That leaves Republicans with evangelicals and libertarians which is increasingly not enough to win 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see  being a pessimist I will accept your response for now Your formatted question and it s grammatical construction suggests you work in a similar profession 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean   sure you  can   But trying to draw specific parallels above and beyond  both are fairly rural western states is disingenuous  or just lacking in in depth knowledge of the area   Lol 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Rust Belt That s the only part of the country that I can possibly see swinging in the other direction Funny enough those contain the states that Joe Biden  has to win in order to become president  Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin  People might say things like  Joe can campaign harder in Florida North Carolina Arizona and then he wouldn t need the Rust Belt    No  Between  and  PA MI and WI consistently voted for the Democrat Not once did a Democratic candidate win without these states Not once did a Democrat lose any of those states but win FL NC AZ Not once did a Democrat do better in any of FL NC AZ than in PA MI WI  If Joe loses  any of the Rust Belt trifecta then his chances diminish rapidly If he loses Pennsylvania it s over That state right there is his linchpin his only hope for victory He only has a chance to win FL NC AZ if he wins the other three  He s going to most likely spend the bulk of his time and resources getting the Rust Belt back so if anything s going to flip it has to be those He has to bring up his background his centrist credentials throw everything and the kitchen sink in order to get them back He s got sort of an uphill battle though and I can absolutely see this race coming right down to the wire again in those states 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And TBH it s Trump s play too  I think it s in Trump s favor even if only a little bit considering his historical position on free trade compared to the bog standard Dem position of the last  years 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And around that time the far left will split with the left and the Republicans will die off and join the moderate conservative Democrats  Nah if things really hit the fan for the Republicans I would think they would tone the religious crazy way down and start moving back to either secular conservatism or Rockefeller Republicanism to get moderate Democrats to come over 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes And nearly all the swing district are suburbs around the city It s a rural vs city divide
PoliticalDiscussion,Who do you think that turnout would benefit 
PoliticalDiscussion,How well do you think Biden would be at winning back Obama Trump Rust Belt voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,because not everything right now that punishes people is criminal we have civil charges they still stop people from doing things if you hop a turnstile of the subway you don t get arrested you pay a fine you re not allowed to do it but you don t get arrested for it the subways aren t  open  they just don t have a criminal charge for breaking the rules but there is still a punishment
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I am going to echo the other guy   you appear to not know many Republicans    gt They are upset because they can t trust Fox  Why would they suddenly not trust Fox What has changed in their typical programming or reporting that would cause them to shift   gt They re scared about getting sick because their insurance sucks and they are scared for their jobs  Jobs are blamed on the external factor of coronavirus and they look at government run insurance as being worse Additionally I would argue that many Republicans actually are not totally against their private insurance as you seem to imply   gt They talked about Dems blocking the recovery bill but when they learn that Dems basically made and charged the bill up her help to everyone first and then work on the bigger stuff later they flat out duck out  Trust me it is not seen that way by many Republicans Talking points of diversity measurements required minimum wage levels carbon emission standards and other riders on the House bill unrelated to direct recovery are trotted out while pointing to how the first recovery bill failed along party lines I am not saying the bill currently running through is not better but it is  how the process was painted and perceived by many Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Haha No I m just somebody who likes looking at a lot of maps and has made a hobby out of pouring over election maps 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are the on being a dogmatic individual here You saying you can deport these people somehow after you remove a law that does exactly that Again explain to me how decriminalizing something means you can still enforce it as if it was  This idea of treating someone who comes to this country civil is what exactly if you come into a home youre not welcomed are you going to welcomed with open arms and told to stay as long as you want Youre not explaining how making something not illegal can still be enforced   If we suddenly decriminalize punching you in the face tell me how you can still arrest them or even defend yourself at that point 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Same thing if the economy tanks and people lose their jobs  Half my town  Laramie and a huge chunk of my state  Wyoming is unemployed and has been for a while now and no one here has changed their minds either way  We also saw a  very nasty economic downturn a couple of years ago  spurred by coal s collapse that went unnoticed by most of the outside world and we were are still firmly entrenched in our support of Trump Republicans in general    There s not as many potential fence sitters as you d think 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know if that s a hard rule though especially in the midwest States like Indiana Kentucky Tennessee all have metro cities that are pale blue at best  I also noticed that southwest states tend to be more homogeneous  Nevada Arizona New Mexico  Their big cities are only slightly blue and the states are only slightly red 
PoliticalDiscussion,My guess is that the Democrats strengthen their grip on the suburbs due to Biden s strength there Trump still wins Texas by  points and Georgia by   but the Republicans potentially lose House seats in both states Arizona and Michigan will vote blue while Wisconsin stays red and PA NC will end up deciding the election   The  realistic dream scenario for Democrats is winning MI AZ NC WI PA being competitive in TX GA  still too early for those states to flip red  and flipping Senate seats in CO AZ NC ME  Doug Jones winning re election is probably a fantasy  for Republicans it s winning all of those states being competitive in MN again taking the House back and retaining their Senate seats while flipping Michigan s seat held by Gary Peters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Rural areas Small communities are hard to make your way in if you aren t religious 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not even real democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a rally around the flag effect right now in the time of crisis People try to get behind their leaders who they view as stable in uncertain times It s more of an instinctive reaction more than anything  One thing that s been noted by some analyists though is that the boost Trump got from the crisis isn t as high as other presidents Bush got a  point boost during   and Carter had his approval rating spike when the Iran Hostage Crisis started With respect to the current situation other world leaders are also seeing better gains in their approval ratings too For instance Conte has approval ratings as high as  percent and Johnson was reported to have a  point shift in his polling as a result of the coronavirus  I don t think it will last though The way I see it there are two ways this could go Either the problem resolves itself and people forget about it causing the rally effect to dissipate Or the crisis can continue and get worse while people get tired or impatient with their leader for not addressing it It looks like we re headed for the second option here As people start dying and the economic toll of the recession really starts to dig in I don t expect Trump s approval ratings to hold 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree having a big tent is only a bad thing as long as the GOP use it to point to the extremes and paint the entire party in that light Sure Joe Manchin and Bernie may both be Democrats but are they ideologically similar I think the division in the party has become a strength in governing but a weakness while campaigning against those who will be intellectually dishonest about the race they are in hence GOP candidates running ads saying blue dogs are basically socialists If a Democrat gets in and shows they are blue but have a backbone for certain issues like Manchin they can hold a seat in a red state imo especially running against a Trump republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,How many people no longer identify as a republican because of him though Many people say they are independent in times like these and with how divisive he is I wouldn t be surprised if those numbers shifted especially in suburban areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,While this is true I think property costs are driving young Democrats to mid sized cities as well Charleston is growing at a rapid pace as well as Greenville and the whole state may not turn blue but South Carolina could be less red in the future as more people move in Mississippi Alabama and Louisiana probably not
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I was just looking up past election results and I noticed that Obama actually won Indiana in  which seems inconceivable now I also noticed that Indiana actually had a Democratic Senator who lost reelection in  It seems the state is trending more red but some not so distant history shows that it can be blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you I edited my comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you mean Wyoming given that Wisconsin has no oil 
PoliticalDiscussion,I took that statement more as a goal to achieve not as a hard in place command 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indiana leans pretty red I live in NWI about an hour east of Chicago so we tend to lean a little more blue in my region Gary is big part of that Back in  I think Gary had their highest ever voter turn out So it s possible to flip Indiana if you can get the NWI area to go out and vote blue We ve got a lot of people in this area that spend a lot of time in Chicago either for work or for entertainment 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Was Trump s quote That was a lie It has not been approved by the FDA Nothing will be made almost immediately  You re right It was false But it s not him telling anyone to drink eat fishbowl cleaner I ll keep my     We re not in disagreement that Trump said some bullshit What we re in disagreement about is that he didn t tell stupid people to do even more stupid shit 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Do you just not grasp the concept that if a person of authority  someone like the President of the United States of America the highest office in the nation the most powerful man in the world  says that there s maybe a miracle cure that there could be  a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine that people will act upon that  No I grasp the concept But I also grasp the concept that the people who would do this are fucking idiots to go drink fish bowl cleaner because that s  clearly not what they were told or suggested to do  Thus while I agree Trump s enthusiasm about this malaria treatment isn t backed by solid data as Dr Fauci said right after Trump said that shit I also don t blame him for idiots being idiots 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll be interested to see if this stay at home situation has any implications in opening up more roles to be remote only  In that case I could see younger remote workers start to consider places like WY similar to the digital nomad lifestyle but with less moving    lots of outdoor recreation opportunities and low cost of living for a population that doesn t necessarily need all the bells and whistles of a super advanced medical infrastructure 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tennessee lol I have lived here all my life and the people here are obsessed with Trump and will vote for him no matter what They really hated Obama too 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the key to a Biden victory in the electoral college and Democrats success in Senate is to repeat their success in the Suburbs from the  Mid Terms      The article states that the Democrats were able to gain  House Seats in districts that were classified as  Sparse Suburban or  Dense Suburban  The Democrats had massive success in Romney Clinton districts here Romney won in  but Clinton won in  which are primarily found in the suburbs However Democrats also won several seats in Romney Trump districts districts that were typically solid Republican This seems to signal a more permanent shift of suburban voters to the Democratic party While Democrats did win many Obama Trump districts in  it was mainly incumbents maintaining their seats indicating that these voters are not changing their votes in large numbers So far there are few signs of this shift reversing in the  election with the economy tanking because of COVID and Trump containing to be Trump even during a crisis   As we get closer to the  election I could see much of the analysis being the impact of these Suburb voters typically college educated women that Biden has fone well with in the primary impact the swing state vote I believe that it will be these voters not Obama Trump voters that will cause states like Pennsylvania Michigan and maybe states like Ohio North Carolina and even Arizona to flip blue in  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m in Virginia and it s much of an annoyance here as well It used to be that this tri State area was somewhat perfect Maryland was mega Democrat with their high taxes and hippy like vibes With some areas are extremely wealthy and others are falling apart while government keeps running more programs that never actually do much   In DC it is a mounding of everything range of the political spectrum and a government that is endlessly trying to appear relevant   Then Virginia was the  safe space for Republicans Where even though there is heavy taxation government services focus on economic prosperities and enforcement of existing laws rather than always making new ones You could literally see and feel the differences when you crossed state borders  And now Virginia has for the first time gone full Blue even though the blue districts only make up like  of the state And they immediately went to work to start changing the entire Republican fabric of Virginia and people are seriously up in arms about it Including   of counties openly state that they will not enforce new legislation enacted by the state But the state still making moves to ensure their continued hold on power by moves such as allowing felons to vote in the range of hundreds of thousands and offering grandstanding moves to defy federal immigration laws   Overall the state went from a stable prosperous self reliant environment to a test case for progressive agendas It s very disconcerting not having a remote idea of what the state will look like in  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,To add to your analysis I do not see Louisiana ever being blue either New Orleans is relatively small with a population of only about  people and due to spacial restrictions cannot really grow The suburbs yes have been and expanding but the suburbs are all heavily republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this assumption is ignoring the tendency for voters to get more conservative as they age Just think about how rapidly the Democratic Party has moved to the left on issues like immigration  open borders taxpayer funded health insurance for illegal aliens not removing criminal aliens etc  Climate change  Green New Deal  and the push towards socialism within their ranks since the  election How long before more moderate Democrats share more in common with moderate Republicans I think the voter creep can certainly extend in both directions  That being said it seems that culturally the country as a whole seems to be getting more liberal it will be interesting to see if and when that trend stops and if there will be a pendulum swing in the opposite direction 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Clinton s biggest issue in  was turnout and she was extremely unpopular here in ways that Biden won t be  This is so fundamental to Biden winning it s hilarious   Otherwise your post is an excellent write up    gt the Midwest has a ton of economic anxiety and a winning platform for Biden is to address that anxiety directly  Dead on the midwest has lagged the rest of the country in economic growth and Biden needs to hit that hard I m originally from Ohio so I follow their scene 
PoliticalDiscussion,IMO it will be more impressive if NC goes blue this year  was a wave year Obama was on the ticket and just as importantly Republican turnout was depressed   Republican turnout will not be depressed this year 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s because coalitions change We we were talking about the blue wall for  years and then Trump crashed through it like the kool aid man That s why it s always unwise to try and project this state will be blue or that one red in the near future Because coalitions shift every  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s because coalitions change We we were talking about the blue wall for  years and then Trump crashed through it like the kool aid man That s why it s always unwise to try and project this state will be blue or that one red in the near future Because coalitions shift every  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hate the US electoral system
PoliticalDiscussion,Wisconsin is red because of oil and resource extraction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alaska 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure how much of a difference young people will make I mean look at Bernie Sanders He s the  young people s candidate  yet young people can t even be bothered to go to the polls for him Not really surprising considering youth voter turnout has historically been lower than everyone else s 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t read too much into disliking Trump There are a ton of  never Trumpers still I d guess there are more now then there were in  actually but he is the sitting President 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but that depends on how many people move in and out There s usually a threshold on the number of people gained or lost before they consider whether a state should gain or lose electoral votes
PoliticalDiscussion,Missouri  apparently we re getting a lot of conservative immigration from the west coast 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I thought as well I m really not sure where OP is getting this  Democrats migrating thing from 
PoliticalDiscussion,Could the economy be reopened Yes It would kill people but of course it could be done  But could Trump order it reopened Probably not because it was not him who ordered it closed  he was fiddling as Rome burned and Governors took the initiative 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think WV will be interesting to watch I own an AirBnB in Fayetteville That town is a liberal as Asheville NC As I ve spent time in the state I can see it changing Tourism is the only growth industry and lots of young people from the surrounding states are actually moving in and starting small tourism focused businesses 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh I don t know about that at least in Kentucky I live in Kentucky and have lived in every city town in the state at one point or another Louisville by far the biggest metro area is hard blue while Lexington the only other truly urban area in the state is solid blue but definitely not as blue as Louisville Our Governor s race was won by a Democrat primarily because he won those two cities by huge margins The third biggest town Bowling Green  around  people so not close to being a true urban area but the closest town to being a metro area is already purple thanks to a mid sized university being there Its county was won by Governor Beshear by a slim margin in  but in national elections goes red   I don t know much about Indiana or Tennessee but I believe that Nashville is definitely shifting from pale blue to hard blue with the huge growth it s experiencing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Visit in the dead of winter before you go for good 
PoliticalDiscussion,Idk Laramie has a hell of a rail yard 
PoliticalDiscussion,McConnell said that about Obama in  not John Boehner 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Spanish Flu which lasted for almost  years and was much more deadly and contagious than COVID didn t infect   of the population It infected   of the population and killed   adjusted to today that would be       I would be very very surprised if this virus came close to the worst influensa outbreak in human history  death rate of   especially when you consider antibiotics didn t exist back then and not ventilators 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes All those without huge urban areas and cities where a lot people immigrate to 
PoliticalDiscussion,A few things       Trump actively downplayed or ignored warnings about the virus to try and basically brush past the crisis hoping it would not be so major and that the fear wouldn t tank the economy       Early on his best decision was to close travel to China That was smart  something he always brings up but it was not the only action he should have taken       He made several key early mistakes He had already underfunded the CDC and NIH and cut the pandemic response team Early in the crisis January especially he should have directed COVID testing to increase exponentially and started stockpiling medical supplies This wasn t a secret Democrats in congress were asking him to do this and the CDC was ringing alarm bells       He should have really taken things seriously after the first few cases of community spread the state of emergency was over a month too late       Most importantly his main problem was messaging He did not really take this seriously publicly until early March over two months too late He continued to downplay it publicly and even openly contradict his health advisers       Even now he still routinely makes false or misleading statements  reopening by Easter  game changing drugs        In regards to Nevada s executive order it really makes sense from a medical perspective First it still permits the experimental use of hydroxychloroquine in an inpatient  i e inside the hospital setting so the sickest patients can be supplied the medication if their doctor deems it necessary Second it prevents outpatient doctors from prescribing for people who are not sick enough to be in the hospital We have only a limited supply of these drugs which are used for other things like Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis we can t be throwing these drugs around when we don t even have any solid trials showing their effectiveness 
PoliticalDiscussion,At under  percent that still is bad news if this is his highest for Trump and it s only going to get worse for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,He isn t going to get re elected If he keeps going the way he is going he might be pulled due to he ravaging the economy because of the death count spiraling upward   People are watching more news than before as they should A new ad just was released that is real bad for Trump and they are trying to stop it from airing It s not even from Bloomberg s camp Just wait until Bloomberg starts airing ads against Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,You think campaign strategists are looking through political Reddit for valid information and advice Eesh 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry but I asked for any policy platform supporting  unregulated immigration  as you claimed   Quote one Provide a link Anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats rely heavily on ballot harvesting and voter fraud to win
PoliticalDiscussion,No he called the Democratic response to Coronavirus a hoax 
PoliticalDiscussion,This Trump administration is a nightmare the Republican party is going to feel it in November as they have become the party of death There is no way they can save any face over this Not that they won t try   What is ironic Rand Paul not because he got COVID Is that as a guy who thinks he is Libertarian  yet could not pass up free gym and lunches provided by the government 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Colorado Virginia and Arizona  Aren t those states all examples of what OP is talking about though Throw in Nevada and those are explained by people from other states moving in and changing the votes of the state  Virginia is entirely decided by the super wealthy counties adjacent to DC which have gained a ton of population from government jobs and lobbyists Nevada is full of fleeing Californians  Reno is no longer the nd largest city thanks to this  and the same can be said for Arizona and Colorado though the latter has more from other areas due to marijuana legalization  They re not really cases of Democrats changing anyone s minds but just their voters moving into the states and changing them much to the annoyance of the existing people who really hate Californians 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden definitely The Democrats won nationally by   in the  midterms If that holds nationally Clinton won by   All things being equal   increase across the board evenly obviously now how it would work in reality  that would give Biden in my quick count  EV flipping PA MI WI NC GA FL and AZ   Given the difference in support Biden has shown in the upper Midwest and the South it seems plausible that only Florida Arizona and Georgia are toss ups or lean right 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not necessarily true Hillary won by   and it was close in a few states There s a wide margin of popular vote results where Biden could win or lose it really just comes down to a handful of states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Looks like Biden got the nod    Was pretty clear to see really    Don t know how someone so wise could ve missed it 
PoliticalDiscussion,His initial response was good  But after that he kept giving medical advise which was inaccurate dangerous and gotten people killed  So yeah started good then Kruger Dunning took over 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I have run into that quite a bit   politics is notorious if you aren t a progressive loving Bernie worshipping hipster you get shouted down  When you point out flaws in there logic like yeah Biden dies it still won t be Bernie because the majority didn t vote for him so why are you spitting on there face by electing him didn t go over well whent he person told me I was spitting in the face of Bernie supporters when I said Democrats still wouldn t likely throw Bernie up if Biden died 
PoliticalDiscussion,He got a bump at the start of the Crisis which can be seen around March    Then he went loco after that and has had a steady decline as newer polls are further away from his starting point where he got that bump  Given it another week and its likely to be much much worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why not spend this on Michigan or Pennsylvania k more voters can make the difference 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is correct It seems like a permanent reality that rural areas vote Republican but the trend has really intensified over the past  years The current Democratic message doesn t work in rural areas I wonder if over the next decade the message will get worse or if Democrats figure out a way to stop alienating this voter base 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah during  they pretty much wiped out a lot of the possible moderates in the party because of the viking stadium 
PoliticalDiscussion,High turnout Biden definitely  As I have been saying  This election isn t so much about Biden  But how much you hate Trump  And while you might have a week candidate normally  Trump endears that kind of visceral hatred amongst liberals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politics are far less stable than you might think and as long as there is a two party system both parties will have over  of the vote I would recommend urban areas in general maybe Alaska but an urban rural or white ethnic divide will not necessarily be the most important difference in  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Polling is not trending well for Trump  Its been trending down for the past week after his initial pump  Around  to now between    And I don t see it improving unless Mununchin and Parscale can limit his press conferences 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its true that illegal immigrants can t vote but that was never the goal in the first place  The real object is changing the political demographics of the country  Its a huge reason why traditionally red areas in the Southwest are turning purple and even blue in some districts
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And his virus response has not been bad so far I  He called it a  Democratic Hoax    These deaths are on your shoulders now 
PoliticalDiscussion,One thing to keep an eye on is with Fracking markets going up in smoke it could change dynamics  Why have fracking if you no company is going to frack in the first place 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump has absolutely no chance in Minnesota  That I am positive of  Too many people like myself work in healthcare and there is no chance we are going to shoot ourselves in the foot and lose our jobs at our insurance companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I remember during one of the debates back in the summer one of the candidates said they should repeal the statute that makes entering the country illegally a crime and when asked if they agreed most of the candidates raised their hands  And that s just one of many policy positions that favor deregulation of immigration
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigan will got to the Democrats  Arizona and North Carolina as well  Wisconsin is a coinflip I think it will stick with Trump  I also wouldn t be shocked if Trump loses Texas also  I also wouldn t be surprised if he lost by  Million votes and wins the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or a successful Troll  Hard to tell which 
PoliticalDiscussion,Virtually every one of Bernie Sander s immigration policy positions points to deregulating immigration and decriminalizing illegal entry and neither Biden nor Sanders support deportations for serious crimes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah  But Cruz is a hard candidate to quantify  He frankly hard to like in the fist place  And Texas retail politics don t really suit him that well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but the problem is that he DID turn out his base and barely won  And the other candidate was historically unpopular and he still lost the popular vote  This bodes poorly for him since he hasn t really gotten any traction with other voters  And his democraphics are dying off since Baby boomers are shrinking  Not because of the virus but just life in general 
PoliticalDiscussion,They can be gotten  But that would literally mean pissing off the gun control crowd 
PoliticalDiscussion,The auditing alone is going to be a nightmare 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it will go purple  But Cruz was a historically unpopular Senator  So those numbers might take awhile again  Except against the Lt Governor  His ass is gone next election 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think one could get through the primary process for the foreseeable future 
PoliticalDiscussion,A moderate republican could win the state again  But those dinosaurs are long gone now a days 
PoliticalDiscussion,People have been predicting that my entire adult life  When Bush was prez  It can t get worse than this then John Boehner  my top priority is to make Obama a one term president  led the party and people remembered Bush fondly because he reached accross the isle a few times  Then Boehner quit in disgust because his caucus was even crazier than he was and Trump wins the election with a minority of the votes and they had to beg Paul Ryan to be the adult on the room    They aren t getting more moderate they are getting more extreme  Every year they get worse  I will believe they can change when they do so not before 
PoliticalDiscussion,They weren t really Democrats though  Those same voters went republican  And a lot of Democrats switched parties particularly in the south once they saw the wind blowing that way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Utah  Population there is not conducive to a purple shift  People can t move fast enough to outpopulate the mormons 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And his virus response has not been bad so far  His response so far has been to not give a fuck that Americans are dying and to focus on the stock market   There were  cases today In two days time we ll pass the number of cases in Italy and the day after that it will be bigger in the US than it ever was in China   And Trump doesn t care he s disinterested in the human impact and only cares about Wall Street    gt governors banning medicine after Trump stated it shows promise that is bad  Trump s not a Doctor dude Trump s not a medical expert and will talk up any snakeoil like the sleazebag salesman he is 
PoliticalDiscussion,It wasn t passive aggressive you legitimately seemed confused He was talking about how attempts by the Fed to use monetary policy to stimulate markets has done nothing and you were talking about the stimulus measures by congress which are entirely separate I honestly thought that you didn t understand that those were two different things I m sorry if you felt offended  I think really then it just comes down do a different reading of what OP said When I read   gt This was why the   fed cuts and trillion dollar stimulus measures  didn t do anything to bring the markets up  I immediately assumed it was read as  cuts and stimulus measures enacted by the fed  not  cuts enacted by the fed and all stimulus measures from government  The first reading makes sense to me in this case because those were the things that fit into the category of  not addressing the health crisis  and it seems like OP meant it that way as well It seems that you read it in the second way which going back and reading it   I can definitely see how it reads like that It s ambiguous phrasing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden IMO if elected will be spending most of his first  maybe only term fixing all the broken china Trump left behind having to rebuild the state department fixing what DeVoss dismantled etc  while also rebuilding the ACA I don t know how much  progressive he would achieve since a single payer option has been a Liberal idea since Clinton as FLOTUS I don t know what progressive ideas are any different from Liberal ideas Paying off college debt That s not a  progressive action That s a regressive action but more than likely one that would stem from the economic recession due to COVID   At least Biden was there during the last recession but this time the Democrats are demanding the general population being the benefactor of bailouts The amount of stimulus packages to keep from a true economic depression post COVID could amount well above  trillion just by the end of this year So I don t see much  progressive action under the guise of it s politics It could very well be just due to the economics of a global pandemic where government will take the huge role over health care and increased wages just to get the country back on track 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you I knew it was roughly a  difference with about  times as many Trump voters as Clinton voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s an intentionally divisive false narrative that is fed to the right because they themselves are obsessed with straight white male identity politics and are very easily triggered 
PoliticalDiscussion,The iron range is changing and will continue to do so as labor and environmentalism continue to clash but the growth of the twin cities will cancel that out  It looks a lot closer because of the  presidential election but that seems to be an anomaly both before and after 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah the suburbs that shifted to Democrats were not primarily a result of Democrats moving to them Suburban white voters moving towards the Democratic party is part of what s been happening recently  In fact didn t an exit poll in the  Senate race in Texas actually show people who grew up in Texas voted slightly in favor of Beto while people who moved to Texas voted for Cruz 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not a clean analogy but didn t didn t Bush s reelection plan in  partially rely on increasing turnout along his conservative base I feel like Trump is gonna have something like that but on a different level 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt All places tend to shift towards the left ever so slightly as we move further and further into the future  I agree with that assertion for social policies but for economic policies I feel like that isn t necessarily the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,The two destinations you named are both in the northwest corner of the state It s a good thing the map wasn t divided up slightly differently because if Yellowstone and Tetons ended up in Montana or Idaho Wyoming would have nothing left 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good news is that any questions about your mental state hold up poorly when being asked by Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,So did Indiana
PoliticalDiscussion,I d like to point out the same people who called him a tyrannical dictator before this are demanding he invoke all his presidential power to lock the nation down   And his virus response has not been bad so far It s governors banning medicine after Trump stated it shows promise that is bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas has changed because of California voters fleeing the state and its taxes As urban population grows Texas is getting more purple 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree completely He has been beyond incompetent in his response and people will die as a result  I just think we should be accurate in our facts while criticising him He wanted the CDC to have less funding but Congress said no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whose fault is that This is what happens when you decide to be president for only the people that voted for you and everybody else can go fuck themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not so sure Bernie and the progressives have done a pretty good job of laying bare the greed and excess of the billionaire class Trump with his ego and narcissism has played into that narrative quite well And regardless whether joe rustbelt supports progressive policy or not he s at least seen that 
PoliticalDiscussion,The politics of N ME are not well aligned with Romney They are very well aligned with Trump   The Trump v Biden polling in OH has been unexpected and quite interesting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Much of it are the media networks carrying his briefings with no fact checking He s lying about what s happening so people approve of how he is handling The lie gets more coverage than the fact check
PoliticalDiscussion,That is true What s also true is he disbanded the pandemic response team and removed people such as our CDC expert in China   And it s still a relevant conversation about his leadership as this was heavily stressed to his admin as a potential big issue when he first cane to office and every year his budget requested to slash CDC funding 
PoliticalDiscussion,Arkansas voted  red this last primary The only big cities we have are Fayetteville Bentonville and Little Rock 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump won OH by a considerable margin in  and their state legislature is pretty darn red at this point Biden will almost assuredly do better there than HRC but will it be enough to overturn the  or so margin Trump won by in   ME may split again who knows Their one electoral vote that went to Trump also went for Obama in  iirc 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting I didn t really know for sure 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a managed plutocratic democracy
PoliticalDiscussion,And Democrats were absolutely correct in their response and he was absolutely wrong That s been made more than evident 
PoliticalDiscussion,Young people turn old and become more likely to vote but their beliefs likely won t change 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah and PA had been in play for a while Romney spent a lot trying to win that state and Hilary campaigned there a lot too The decision to ignore WI by her campaign was unwise though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am genuinely worried there are people out there who hate Trump so much they would be willing to make the pandemic worse to harm his re election chances  Scientists and public health people are heavy technocratic progressives I have a lot of friends in these fields and they are near unanimously anti Trump I have no doubt they all want to do the right thing and there s no evil conspiracy but unconscious bias and groupthink are very real phenomena that not even scientists are immune to 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree  unless Bernie somehow won the nom Those people just want a return to normalcy not a massive swing in the other direction 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean you re certainly right But republican s are far less likely to believe Covid is a threat than other side   But there is plenty of time for change I suppose 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well seeing as Trump is topping the ticket this year it will absolutely keep them blue this year 
PoliticalDiscussion,I lived in Phoenix that had plenty of Republicans all over the place  I m a pretty well traveled person and that was the best example I could find of a Republican urban area 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but I believe that Nashville is definitely shifting from pale blue to hard blue   I live in TN and can confirm this Nashville and Memphis are hard blue The next  largest cities Knoxville and Chattanooga are pale blue at best 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please tell me if I m misinterpreting this data I m not an economist  According to the OECD the US deficit was the highest among member countries in  at    of GDP     The debt to GDP ration is one of the highest in the world as well at       Could a recession combined with massive government expenditure lead to a debt crisis in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Houston is the th largest city in America and only leaned blue by  in the  presidential election  This really depends on what you mean by  Houston  and I m not sure what definition you re using Clinton won Harris County by more than   but if you include the entirety of  Greater Houston  she actually lost there  mainly due to Montgomery County the suburbs north of Houston  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure it s a good idea to be making predictions on turnout right now The impact of Covid is still very uncertain If it s still a factor in November then who knows what will happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden wins by winning every state Clinton won then Michigan Pennslyvania and either Wisconsin Arizona Florida or North Carolina He ll campaign in all four of those states to maximise his chances  There is not much need to debate it further than that if Biden wins Texas or Iowa or if Trump wins Minnesota and Maine then the election is already over 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely on the money here but I d add places with growing  micro metros around colleges  You re seeing a slow shift in Montana with this and you re seeing it more and more in Wisconsin too  which to be fair is already purple  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s too early to say if they will stay blue or if they just hate Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dems flip MI PA and better than even chance of flipping OH NC AZ and a better than even chance of keeping NH VA ME stays split Republicans flip nothing and have a better than even chance of keeping FL WI Biden will win the popular vote by more than Hillary maybe as much as    Trump could easily still win although I d have to favor Biden at this point  states are going to be extremely close 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will be interesting to see what this virus does to these red blue landscapes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed I m just saying it s largely due to an urban area It s the same phenomena that Atlanta turns Georgia blue Chicago keeps Illinois blue DC largely made Virginia blue  I don t think similarly sized cities would have as much of an effect that DC does on VA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where LOL   that s a joke My wife is born and raised in Minnesota I m pretty sure the state is a typical example of a roadmap for how large states are  blue purple but most  Areas are red  ie Washington Oregon Illinois etc and even California Lots of land lots of red space but big blue cities make the majority of the pop 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right that Trump and the GOP are going to go all in on the  Biden has dementia bullshit but we ll see if it works      Everyone thought Biden would shit the bed against Bernie  on  and he did surprisingly well      Biden s going to say some dumb shit stutter gaffe etc etc but he s always done that He s been known as a gaffe machine for decades     xB  Trump s own ramblefuckery and incoherence is going to greatly reduce the effectiveness of this attack line against Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah MSP and Duluth are both blue and the rest of the state  which includes Rochester tends to go Red Republicans have begun to push and the margins are slimmer but I don t see it flipping
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it actually would I believe in community over authoritarianism Communities are coordinated locally by people with shared vested interests In an authoritarian environment it is only a single clustered mass of powerful people that get to rule over all other disconnected localities So yeah I d feel much better if for example  of districts were blue  were purple and the other  were red At least it would be a significant share of  of districts that have similar positions as opposed  of localized  communities taking control over  of other communities throughout the state I also believe in equality and I believe that size alone doesn t make any one community more valuable or entitled than another 
PoliticalDiscussion,Recent polling in WI leads me to believe Trump s going to win there again but I hope I m wrong  The state seems to be trending GOP and Trump is pretty popular there     xB  The lack of major urban centers in the state don t help dems either Lot of rural whites that bought into the GOP culture war     xB  Biden can still win but it will be tough 
PoliticalDiscussion,ME split in  and will likely do so again Oddly the two March OH polls on  are taken together even and fall summer polling had Biden up FL on the other hand seems slightly but persistently red
PoliticalDiscussion,The Deep South excluding Texas  There are two reasons One is because the South is not developed enough to make it a consideration for moving to And two is because it is so red it would take a massive wave of Democrats to even hope to turn them purple 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cheap travel  not for long 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like Laramie  especially the Snowy Range Cheyenne sucks ass 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wish you were right but there are far too many redditors obsessed with their A rights for this ever to be the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was speaking more about a long term   years or so trend as opposed to a blip on the radar
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree I watched that press conference live I know very little about medicine health virology and all assorted things But I know that even if Trump is touting some drug as a possible  miracle treatment that it s something I should ask my doctor about It didn t take my university education or high IQ for me to understand that I shouldn t take a non doctor s hyperbolic statements and go chug fish bowl cleaner to cure a viral infection  Trump s word never said to take this shit on your own without getting it administered by a medical doctor Not once did he say anything even that could be construed as that These people are morons Period These are the people who get fooled by Nigerian prince scams via e mail or tech support scams from India This is Darwinism at work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton lost by k votes in  Obama lost by k in  On the Senate side Enzi won by k in  and Barasso won by k in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is why it becoming a solid blue state is a sign of suburban shift to Democrats prior to Obama the state had not gone blue for  years Because of the suburban shift  especially from the DC crowd  it s no longer a battleground state 
PoliticalDiscussion,There was a kid in his s that interned where I work He s moving to Wyoming this summer with a bunch of friends They re just gonna save a shitton of money and hike all the time Makes sense there s really affordable mountain towns there You could never afford these in Colorado now
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming is actually gorgeous And it s still very affordable The problem is it doesn t offer much for families But for  year Olds working remotely WY and Idaho are great Seriously Just drive through if you don t believe me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But I also grasp the concept that the people who would do this are fucking idiots  Sure We don t disagree on that point  However idiots exist A responsible government accounts for that By extension that s also why we have entire departments and legislation dedicated to protecting consumers workers taxpayers  The problem here is that in an elevated threat scenario people  including idiots  cannot trust the word of the President of the United States of America  That s pretty bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,I actually kept my eye on that with the rhetoric around this Covid response I was wondering if maybe the GOP leadership would throw a bone to the working class families  and not just the rural ones they ve labeled  real americans  but the urban more minority ones who are always and have always been struggling  But they simply can t bring themselves to do anything that substantially benefits anybody other than the rich Not even as a strategic tactic  They also know that to keep their base rallied against the  others they  have to keep playing the hits on every talk show and every event  That doesn t comport with any of the ideas from the left I don t see any policies they could borrow without taking heat from both their donor class they depend on for money and the working poor they depend on for votes 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree but having a large part of your state economy in resource extraction reinforces the support for conservatism in the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ballot harvesting can be abused in some states like CA  But those laws don t seem to be the norm in other states  Evidence of voter fraud 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m pretty sure Wyoming was conservative before Oil   Gas moved in Its a rural place with very few people The land itself lends itself to self sufficiency and independence which appeals to and breeds a more conservative mindset 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed   Progressives had some headwind coming into this year but their standard bearer squandered  years of building infrastructure fundraising and free media   I will always argue if Bernie ran a unity campaign he could ve crushed the primary Progressives need a new face 
PoliticalDiscussion,Virginia had DC though a unique suburb dominated city 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think what s happened is that the republicans are now considered even farther away from the youth than they ve ever been but that the democrats are now beginning to align less and less with the youth as well They re still miles closer to the desires of the youth but is that enough to to keep them passionate motivated engaged and   to actually VOTE The polling numbers don t seem clear on that and the youth don t vote much anyways  If they get annoyed any more than they are apathy rather than voting republican can be the downfall of the democrat party 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And now Virginia has for the first time gone full Blue even though the blue districts only make up like  of the state  Would it make any difference to you if they were more spread out geographically rather than clustered together in less land mass 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whenever a family member of mine from NY has had it with Cuomo and the restrictive gun laws they move to the Carolinas They say bc it s cheaper but the politics are a huge part
PoliticalDiscussion,I thought that had more to do with changing voting patterns than people moving is all  Well except for maybe Carolina 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I m asking for places that will always stay Red 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it will be purple for a while  The last AG election was quite close but other statewide offices still had healthy margins  The statehouse could fall to Democrats in the foreseeable future  it would be nice in  so they have a say in redistricting 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a lot of wealthy people and then a lot of New Yorkers who fled NY the same reason Trump did resident wise Mainly here for tax purposes and gives nothing back to the community
PoliticalDiscussion,My friends parents live over in antique row and their obsessed with Trump Not even religious and they started going to that church he goes to just because he goes to it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Fed is part of the executive branch  Someone is definitely confused here It s not me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I think if Biden ran this sort of  more Obama years campaign in  he would ve gotten clobbered since people just went through  years of it Now I think alot are desperate to return to that time I think that that was also why Bernie s message didn t resonate with people as much as it did in   that and the fact that he wasn t running against Clinton  People wanted change in  but now they just want to go back to normal first which is reflected in the polling which shows  of people wanting  to beat Trump over  who want policies enacted It sucks but I guess the time for progressive change is set back a bit because of the Trump took the country in a wrong turn off a cliff and now they re just trying to get back to that fork in the road in  
PoliticalDiscussion,       xB  I d point out that Trump has the highest approval rating of his presidency today excluding the first few weeks of  let s give him a chance  Talking about a blue a wave or turning red states purple seems premature 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes   I observed this first hand  People moving from the West coast and moving to Alabama and Georgia turning cities  blue   The blue states become too expensive to live in which causes artist class to migrate to affordable areas  It s deurbanization 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be clear I m not describing a thing I want  I m describing a thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will probably get worse as Democrats have no need to pander to a decreasing minority that is so unlikely to vote for them  Instead they have to care about maintaining their current coalition of minorities urban college educated suburban voters  The part they need to control the bleed of is white working class voters  Minorities can make up the difference over time but they still need them for now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree   I think this year was built for Biden in a way Democrats want a return to normal  no one embodies a return to normal more than Joe    We live in a post Trump era so no one gives a shit about gaffes anymore Biden s campaign would be dead ten times over if the politics of just  years ago were still in effect  I say all this admitting his campaign has been nothing short of awful That being said their strategy paid off completely so who am I to criticize 
PoliticalDiscussion,On point  Trump did not underfund refund or modify the CDC and NIH budgets in any way   Those changes were part of Trump s budget  i e the presidential wish list but Congress decides the budget and did not make those changes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unless that sparks a long term change because it keeps mutating forcing us to have to live less densely the overall effect of c virus shouldn t change the overall trajectory  Older people will probably die more  Rural growth rates are not going to catch up  People keep moving to cities as that is where job and wealth growth is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Source   Gallup poll Tuesday had his corona response at  and his overall approval at the highest they polled     I m assuming that  is from the ABC poll which should be being conducted for this week right now  mar    
PoliticalDiscussion,And that Democratic response was  this is serious and we need Federal action now   To call that a hoax is pretty bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,Probably referring to states like Virginia  once red now pretty solidly blue  NC  once deep red now a swing state and probably blue in  years  and Texas  still red but turning purple fast  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oof that s painting with a pretty wide brush buddy I live in a swing state and I know more young Republicans who really care about politics  which is key than young Democrats Most of the young Democrats in my state just don t show up to vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Damn that s an angle I hadn t considered Intriguing
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is so fundamental to Biden winning it s hilarious  I honestly think that alot of the turnout on the left will be based on just ousting Trump It doesn t matter who they vote for since they will vote for a paper bag over him I mean there was a huge anti Trump vote in  but there was also a strong anti Hillary vote then that kind of neutralized it Just so long as they don t put on someone who s toxic like a Bloomberg or Gabbard then average Joe will probably suffice 
PoliticalDiscussion,Won t the young people in small red states continue to flee 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming technically only needs  k Democrats to move there to flip it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It should be noted that his bump isn t as big as other leaders during the time of a crisis Just look at the double digit gains of the leaders in Europe Boris Johnson was at net  in February and now he s at net   Trump went up by a few points and this is when the rally behind the flag effect is most strongest when people are in shock and act on instinct 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would Indianapolis be because the state artificially incorporated a lot of the surrounding areas into it way back to make it red but over time it has gotten bluer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Border it against another neighbouring red state so it spills over to them too so you get senators and house members too 
PoliticalDiscussion,He already killed one of his idiot supporters who consumed aquarium cleaner because it contained that sweet sweet chloroquine
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s why Georgia and Texas will be blue within a decade they have major cities that will soon outweigh the rural areas  I thought they already did in TX  Rural in TX is only about  of the population           I guess the remainder is officially urban but it is split between actual urban and suburban  The suburbs are also split between inner and outer ring 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well they might be dead 
PoliticalDiscussion,So eventually they ll just be out of luck and they might have individual conservative enclaves left but that s about it  assuming those small towns haven t died altogether  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I d like to point out the same people who called him a tyrannical dictator before this are demanding he invoke all his presidential power to lock the nation down  It s almost as if the country is in a moment of crisis that demands fast and strong decisions be made or something   
PoliticalDiscussion,Nebraska Not worth it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The reason people are talking Bout going back to work is because our economy can t shut down for an extended period without falling into a serious depression  I expect we will have a phased return to work based on how contained the virus is and how much the virus is spreading  Parts of the country that aren t hit hard could return to work faster  Those areas that need to stay locked down will stay locked down  That isn t ignoring the urban areas that is making sure people stay home when they need to this isn t some kind of class warfare And yes the Democrats absolutely do play towards people based on their identity  They say if you re black you should be a Democrat Hispanic well you belong with us too  There isn t a Democratic agenda as such just different identities  When that is all you have that is what speak to so identity politics  Us versus them  It doesn t have to be that way 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The economy has already tanked and people are already losing their jobs and his ratings are rising Arguably the unemployment rate is at its peak because we will probably start slowly opening up sectors of the economy soon Currently the unemployment rate is exceeding the unemployment rate during the great depression  The rally effect isn t exactly rational It s a kneejerk response to a crisis which is what s on people s minds right now The actual pain of Trump s response is yet to be fully felt yet so it s way too early to tell what people think about this    gt during recessions people tend to vote for Republicans Republicans viewed as better with money and at helping the economy while Democrats are viewed as better at dealing with social justice issues Not to mention that Trump has already proven to be good at improving markets  Yeah just look at  or  or  which kicked off a wave of  consecutive wins for the GOP in a row Oh wait that last one was a depression and had the democrats winning sorry about that If the economy tanks here than it will be perceived as being Trump s fault and his subsequent handling of the economic crisis and how much he can fix it will also be judged   gt The left is currently f      up more than Trump Nancy pelosi s little stunt this weekend was head bangingly awful The left is doing its normal thing and trying to find any possible reason to make Trump look bad Including apparently blaming Trump because a couple decided to eat fish tank cleaner But it s not fooling anyone  Trump is doing a pretty good job of doing that himself He downplayed the crisis early on didn t do anything to get mass testing out fired the pandemic response team in  is not doing everything he can to get much needed supplies to states that need them and is planning to reopen the economy by Easter against the wishes of his scientists    gt I think if one of these  treatments we are looking at ends up working or being effective at least  Several of them look very promising This whole thing will be over way sooner than it s we thought and it will guarantee his presidency  People are saying it will take months and at best a year to get a workable vaccine And it s best not to trust the cures that Trump is spewing out 
PoliticalDiscussion,The percentages are huge but the numbers are low  Five Wyoming s is the population of Brooklyn  If as many Californians moved to Wyoming as have moved to Texas it just wouldn t matter at all what the natives thought because they d be outnumbered 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt People under  that hate everything the Republican Party stands for wont go Republican with a face lift They ll never vote Republican in their life that ship has sailed    Depends how left the Democrats keep going Obama s  platform and rhetoric would be torn apart by the current popular left wing media activists etc  As someone who s never voted for a Republican in my life if the election was between someone like Charlie Baker  Republican governor of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders or an AOC type I would really have to think hard 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of folks pointing out states like WY MT MS LA AL etc are Corrext right now and very near future But eventually I think it will happen  Right now we re experiencing the brain drain from rural to urban However when these generations retire many will want to either move back home for nostalgia and to be with family or they will want to retire somewhere affordable and less dense population wise The boomers are doing this now but many are still conservative Future generations will be more liberal when they retire from urban areas and move back to rural areas I think 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you kidding The airlines will have crazy surplus capacity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolute fucking horseshit no one knew You re saying  no one knew the same way Trump does as in  I personally didn t know therefore no one knew   Plenty of people knew the potential for this virus while it was largely still in China Experts and most Democrats were calling on Trump to take more drastic actions for  weeks while he was telling us that we only had  cases in the US and that they were going to go down from there  You don t get to call Democrats telling you to take more serious action a  hoax designed to hurt you politically and then cry that no one knew how bad this was going to get when the results of your head in the sand dithering start to manifest 
PoliticalDiscussion,But you re not worried about the President sabotaging for political reasons 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it is more likely that they ll really change their attitude on it if someone high profile within their party media catches it and dies from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Non sequitur  Wyoming is an extremely beautiful state  A one time payment probably wouldn t be enough for me but any kind of local thriving economy would make it a very interesting decision  And I say that as someone in the suburbs of NYC who would suffer the worst culture shock 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You ve changed the goalposts to be about the fish bowl cleaner that wasn t mentioned in the original comment  gt   gt 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess I couldn t say for sure but I don t the suburbs are as much a result of people moving from other states like cities are  Cities continue to grow but have always been overwhelmingly liberal Most people that leave big cities still want to live in a city setting which is why places like Boise continue to grow   That does help run up the vote total but suburbs have usually been a balance to that Millennials are much more liberal than previous generations Many have started moving back to suburban communities they grew up in and as previous generations especially the Baby Boomers and the silents start to die the demographics of the suburbs haven t really changed but they ve become a lot more purple which is a killer for the GOP 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think Trump s victory is locked in any way While Biden has weaknesses they mostly overlap with some of Trump s  buffoonery women  And he is beating Trump in polls for the most part   gt So honestly I focus on state and local  A man of culture I see 
PoliticalDiscussion,With Tony Evers in Wisconsin I don t think they re getting more conservative at all Ohio and Indiana definitely are though 
PoliticalDiscussion,His platform is  far more liberal than Obama s   minimum wage nationwide  assualt weapons ban  free college for most students 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not just Cali lol   Educated people from everywhere Are coming to Texas Low taxes great property cheap real estate  and the urban and suburban areas have great schools   UT Austin and A M both are very biased to in state students and UT especially is top  in almost every major STEM or finance major   Not to mention tuition is dirt cheap   Texas has a ton going for it but the backwards image cultivated by our governor and the rural parts of the state keep people thinking Texas is Bama with cities
PoliticalDiscussion,Governors are banning it because there are people  lupus patients among others who need the drug They can t get it if all patients pressure their doctors to prescribe it for anything looking like a cold  Once the supply ramps up and the studies confirm its effectiveness then we can start using it for coronavirus medication For now we can t deny treatment for the people that we  know need it Regular antivirals seem to help for coronavirus too so hcq isn t the only option  Remains to be seen whether the public understands it though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am worried about technocratic progressives self sabotaging for emotional reasons People often act irrationally 
PoliticalDiscussion,Significantly higher disapprovals however 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you re seeing is how limited our ability to test is not a slowing in new cases The majority of tests done in California haven t even been processed yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kevin McCarthy and Devin Nunes are both from California 
PoliticalDiscussion,So are you more or less worried about Trump compared to technocratic progressives  Only one has something to gain while the others don t 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Then Henry Bellmon  R triggered a sea change in   Was that Henry doing it or the universal shift in party dynamics and platform around the Civil Rights movement 
PoliticalDiscussion,  yes i found it something you probably could of linked ages ago even if its from a bias source If the source for decriminalizing it is true then it changes nothing So its a miss leading talking point or they are doing what some assume which is open the border  and probably should remain for the reasons explained   I will stand down on it till they clarify it better as that is not how they are talking FYI Bernie would give children that cross the border citizenship  I dont think this is a good idea as it gives the parents the right to stay which defeats the purpose of a border   You on the other hand should learn to research resources you drew out an argument with no sources its annoying and doesn t help you 
PoliticalDiscussion,found it   
PoliticalDiscussion,Your president is trying to kill you your prefeered democratic candidate biden is a joke and your pariah sanders is the voice of reason in these trying times when leadership is needed     Think about that It is not too late 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I really don t agree There are no major underlying problems with the economy it s just on hold We need to bridge the gap from here to there and gov t loans can do that especially in the case of small businesses  That s a serious enough problem in the american economy that  just really isn t an appropriate phrase to use America s economy is entirely dependent on consumer spending If american s aren t getting money they aren t buying If they re not buying companies aren t getting money If companies aren t getting money their employees aren t getting paid  creating a viscous cycle  investments aren t getting made and they might go under If investments aren t being made the stock market goes down which affects people s ks   blah blah blah In short the chain of consequences is gigantic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed
PoliticalDiscussion,He s  percentage points lower than Obama was at this stage It s not much of a rally  I cannot imagine many independents in most states thinking of risking another term with Trump especially when they have a chance to get back to normalcy with Biden They ll rally now just to give him enough confidence to not worsen the current disaster Come election time he s likely gone regardless of what polls say now 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think people will blame Trump for this though which makes this unique  He will be held accountable if they link the economic damage to his failing response The crisis wouldn t have blown up the way it did if he had responded early that s a fact    gt If he had closed the economy in January people would have thought he was a dictator  If he instituted mass testing and enact social distancing measures early on then we would ve been able to keep the virus contained like South Korea We didn t do that   gt He called a national emergency as soon as the first American died  False   The first American died on Feb  and he downplayed their death and said they were already sick      weeks later on March  he declared a national emergency       gt Yeah the media is trying really hard to find reasons to blame him  I just gave a bunch of reasons off the top of my head and I wasn t even trying that hard You don t need to go far in order to find things wrong with his response or to find that he s the one responsible for the mess the country is dealing with now    gt He responded way earlier than Obama by the way and he never said he was planning on reopening the economy by Easter but he was hoping to  I just told you that he spent  months downplaying the situation and now he s downplaying it again as he wants to reopen the economy This as other countries are struggling with the disease and have enacted lockdowns   gt The job of the president is to instill hope  The job of the president is also to listen to the experts and not downplay and mislead people in a crisis situation   gt Vaccines are not cures vaccines are preventatives Cures actually alleviate the symptoms of somebody who already has the disease the drugs that they re testing have already gone through human testing for other diseases And some of these drugs are looking very promising They have already sent a bunch to New York for trials  And it will take months and a year to get them available to the public 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we look at the places Biden s generally won in the primary elections its notable that on top of his strength amongst suburban middle class whites and black voters he s also consistently won rural counties with overwhelmingly white populations Now while primary voting is not a great determinant of general election outcome I would argue it shows the problem Democrats faced in  was a strong anti Clinton sentiment something that made Bernie Sanders more appealing as the single viable non Clinton Democratic candidate For proof in  Sanders won Michigan by less than  point thanks to his overwhelmingly strength in rural counties In  Biden won every single county in Michigan Similarly notable was that primary turnout increased massively from about  million in  to just under  million in  with Biden benefitting overwhelmingly from the increased turnout The other important take away is that the Democrats base is energized This should be fairly obvious given turnout in nearly every primary contest has matched or even exceeded  levels Some of it is due to many of the states scrapping caucuses in favor of primaries  Minnesota and Washington for instance but even in the primary contests there has been consistently higher turnout Regardless of whether this energization is anti Trump sentiment or from there being an actual contest rather than just a perception of an inevitable coronation as in  it indicates that Biden is unlikely to struggle with voter enthusiasm the way Clinton did in   So what might this bode for November For a start it is likely that Biden is much stronger in the Midwest than Clinton was in  and is likely to receive sufficient turnout to capture states Trump narrowly won in  Also helping Biden this year was the defeat of large numbers of GOP governors and state executive branch officials in  something that is likely to result in structural factors benefitting him against Trump My personal prediction is that the states of Michigan and Pennsylvania are far more likely to vote for Biden than for Trump this November   When it comes to the overall outcome my prediction is the tipping point states will be Arizona and Wisconsin with a good possibility of North Carolina flipping too Wisconsin is the most likely to go Biden of the three given its traditional electoral preference for Democrats and the Party s successes there in  including the ouster of Scott Walker However it also has a largely white working class non college educated voter base which could greatly help Trump this November Ultimately the question will be whether Biden is successful at prying enough of those voters out of the Trump camp to add to his base Arizona is the second most likely to flip given the strong presence of hispanics in that state and Trump s constant alienation of them Democrats also enjoyed success in  winning a Senate race and the majority of the House delegation Biden is also likely to get help from Mark Kelly s candidacy for Arizona s Class II Senate seat However Arizona has not voted Democrat since  and its state gov t is still controlled by Republicans North Carolina is the least likely of the three to flip though there are several good factors for Biden Its state executive branch is mostly controlled by Democrats and its electorate has a large proportion of black voters with suburban middle class whites making up much of the remainder However North Carolina is also a traditionally Republican state with strongly socially conservative attitudes something less of a factor to either Arizona or Wisconsin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Could you elaborate I would think Republican party policies would be better for the health insurance industry 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean the only things they ever talk about are social justice They were good at women s rights good at gay rights now it s all about immigrants rights minority rights and environment and the poor Those are currently they re largest platforms And they are all social justice issues    gt I think the younger generations particularly those on social media underestimate how moderate to right wing most Democratic voters are The  impotence seems to be more or less what their voters want for the time being though things like MA and maybe even UBI will become more popular as time goes on judging by how many voters under  approve of them compared to older cohorts  So a lot of States are turning purple because the Democratic party has been divided into two and the liberals are shouting louder than the traditional Democrats we re seeing socialism and all these things that have never been part of the Democratic ideal And the modern Republican ideal is looking closer to the traditional Democratic ideal And then the red side has started adopting things like gay rights women s rights they just have a more economic solution  like improving job markets than an emotional one  let s just tax the rich  It s actually a very dangerous game for the Democratic party because it s been divided into two You have people like AOC and Bernie Sanders in their own little bubble fighting against people who are more traditional Democrats So now they re arguing against each other and they re arguing against the Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That isn t ignoring the urban areas that is making sure people stay home when they need to  Florida Governor  R is still refusing to shut down even though the disease is spreading like fire  Mississippi Governor literally overrode local mayors and made the state keep open  Donald Trump s entire existence is rural white identity politics but you don t see it that way because white and male has been always  default in America From abortion to the caravan to the wall Mexicans shithole countries  go back to where you came from  citizenship question on the census guns conservative judges everything he does is about giving a middle finger to cosmopolitan liberal cities and their residents while taking their money and resources and giving them to his rural white supporters   gt They say if you re black you should be a Democrat Hispanic well you belong with us too   Nobody says that But POC voters from virtually every background who have little in common with each other from African Americans in the rural South to wealthy Asians in the Bay area to Hispanics along the Mexican border to Native reserves whether they are rural urban wealthy poor native born recent immigrants etc the one thing they have in common is they don t vote Republican  Let me repeat myself  We know that as long as the disease isn t well into red America territory Republicans and their voters wouldn t lift a finger 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yeah just look at  or  or  which kicked off a wave of  consecutive wins for the GOP in a row Oh wait that last one was a depression and had the democrats winning sorry about that If the economy tanks here than it will be perceived as being Trump s fault and his subsequent handling of the economic crisis and how much he can fix it will also be judged  Somebody else pointed that out and I was wrong Republicans are more likely to serve during recessions but they aren t more likely to be elected during recessions I don t think people will blame Trump for this though which makes this unique If he had closed the economy in January people would have thought he was a dictator He called a national emergency as soon as the first American died    gt He downplayed the crisis early on didn t do anything to get mass testing out fired the pandemic response team in  is not doing everything he can to get much needed supplies to states that need them and is planning to reopen the economy by Easter against the wishes of his scientists  Yeah the media is trying really hard to find reasons to blame him But like I said most people would have thought he was a dictator in January if he had shut the economy down He responded way earlier than Obama by the way and he never said he was planning on reopening the economy by Easter but he was hoping to Which he should The job of the president is to instill hope    gt People are saying it will take months and at best a year to get a workable vaccine And it s best not to trust the cures that Trump is spewing out if they re just based on anecdotal evidence  Vaccines are not cures vaccines are preventatives Cures actually alleviate the symptoms of somebody who already has the disease the drugs that they re testing have already gone through human testing for other diseases And some of these drugs are looking very promising They have already sent a bunch to New York for trials 
PoliticalDiscussion,They ll just move onto the next cultural war wedge issue It s never about the guns it s about cultural resentment Guns are just an easy excuse to rally around  This isn t  Democrats have less and less to fear from the gun crowd 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah Wyoming
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah for the most part
PoliticalDiscussion,Given his recent absence from the public eye and the fact that Biden is leading him in delegates I m going to guess the only people feeling the Bern are his supporters  many of whom will probably vote Trump again sigh 
PoliticalDiscussion, blue senators 
PoliticalDiscussion,North Carolina will be 
PoliticalDiscussion,It really does seem that identity politics values play a much bigger role in voter s minds than economic benefit I wonder when we may see a political realignment or return to stronger labour movements 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I ve been calling it an oligarchy but plutocracy is more accurate   I think it would be a good idea to switch to some form of ranked voting with no electoral college and no gerrymandering Each person s vote should be counted directly not given to representatives to vote for us And they shouldn t be able to move the district lines to make their party win 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah so it was a Doug Jones in Alabama kind of situation Really bad Republican candidate combined with a conservative Democrat 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is that they can t be reasoned with on  any front There ll always be more issues to exploit short of going full right wing extremist and the propaganda already has its hooks in them  To put it bluntly waiting for their voter base to shrink on its own is a better scenario than hoping they realize they ve been had 
PoliticalDiscussion, I know more young Republicans therefore there s going to be a majority of young Republicans  that s what painting with a wide brush looks like    There isn t a swing state in the country with more young Republicans that care about politics  Read a poll instead of trying to be right with anecdotal arguments  And get some non white friends  There isn t even a red state with more young Republicans in it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hillary lost those states because she did no campaigning there I think of Biden has a smart focus on these states it will reward him 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not an opinion it s a poll      of millennials vote Republican   vote Democrat  That gets worse for Republicans with Zoomers   It doesn t mean no one will vote R it means they re not viable There s no path for a majority 
PoliticalDiscussion, Pretty similar  in fact VERY similar to Obama s ratings in  during his reelection year  
PoliticalDiscussion,Truth is only as good as trust in the people telling it I m not excusing science deniers but the holier than thou attitudes of a lot of scientists many of whom are my friends and colleagues played a part in the rise of climate change deniers and anti vaxxers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Look at the congressional district map for MN in   Democrats were reelected to rural iron range and agrarian districts while the  republicans were in twin cities suburbs and exurbs
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually it hasn t been If you look at it state by state states are seeing a lower increase in cases every day For example five days ago New York saw a  increase in cases Yesterday it saw  increase Today a  increase California had  increase and today it had a  increase  We are still not in the negatives This is true but there are so many states that only have   ish cases That can probably start reopening soon   and if this drug works out then we can really open up the economy because it seems to alleviate symptoms a lot And we should know by the end of this week They ve already administered a bunch to New York for trials 
PoliticalDiscussion,He always considered himself a backup Biden in case Biden s campaign continued to flounder After Super Tuesday when Biden became the front runner there was no sense in continuing  The only thing Bloomberg hated more than the idea of Trump winning another term is Bernie becoming President 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you are in a position of trust during this pandemic and you fail to act in the public s interests for political purposes then it s your fault 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anecdotally some of my family in North East Indiana have always been quite socially conservative but they voted Democratic because they were union members Lately it seems like the  social conservative outweighs the  union member identity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t surprise me if Colorado continues to just sprawl northward  I had a coworker in Boulder who commuted daily from Cheyenne Granted that s not the norm at all but as Ft Collins continues to grow I could absolutely see someone coming down from Southern Wyoming  Wasn t too long ago that Ft Collins felt like the cow town with the Ag university relative to Boulder It changed a lot over  years and I could see Cheyenne going likewise 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve lived on the coast my whole life The majority of it has been spent less than  miles from a coast From the top of my building I can see the Atlantic ocean There s something about living far away from that fills me with anxiety I wouldn t be able to do it long term I don t even like the beach 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have family in OKC and from what I understand it s changing pretty rapidly There are lot of younger  and  somethings moving in to the area because it s super affordable and there s a ton of med tech in the area  seriously I think hospitals are the new Starbucks in the greater OKC region  Are these people moving in mostly of the red variety or would you say they lean more purple My aunt is stubbornly red but her well educated children seem to be pretty open minded  though that doesn t necessarily mean they d ever dare vote Democrat  the horror  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ehh Donnelly  the senator originally won because his opponent said that rape was god s will The state is still pretty red with Indianapolis and NW Indiana  basically chicago suburbs being the exception Even Fort Wayne the nd largest city in the state is only lean blue Its going to take a lot of growth in Indianapolis Fort Wayne and NWI to push us to the blue column 
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats are escaping from democrat states and cities to live in Republican areas Then they turn these areas Democrat and the cycle repeats 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think one large piece missing from analysis like this is that there are conservatives migrating out of blue states to Red states and I think it might be a higher proportion than many people give credit to   New Hampshire is a great example of this but I don t think it is alone My favorite  stat is that native Texans preferred Beto over Cruz It was the transplants that put Cruz over the top according to exit polls   What is really causing former red States to become blue is because the Republican party is becoming a less welcoming place for educated suburbanites and our politics more and more are becoming an urban vs rural phenomenon The Republican party is also not that welcoming to non white people despite the fact that it is the one of the fastest growing parts of the American population As Atlanta Houston and Dallas become more diverse their state becomes more purple 
PoliticalDiscussion,The definition of  evolving and  progress is completely defined by Democrats Leftists However what it means to evolve or progress is completely subjective If the entire world converted to Mormonism a Mormon missionary would see that as progress and as the world evolving An anti industrialist could easily see going back to an agrarian society to be a form of evolution and progress especially after we have lived in an industrial society for several hundred years now The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia saw going back to an agricultural society and killing or re educating people in urban areas as progress and evolving 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there might be something about OH which works for Biden better than the other Dems Like PA but less so WI is whiter and more rural than OH     Trump winning WI and OH wouldn t shock me either  My father who is  a lifelong independent and a Biden guy is convinced that the poles are way off and Trump is going to win win Az FL NC VA PA OH WI NH MI Mn but lose the popular vote Rally round the flag   We ll see 
PoliticalDiscussion,And we re on track to have one of the worst outbreaks of any country on the planet we re certainly going to pass Italy and probably going to pass China in terms of total cases deaths from this  Some hoax huh Definitely doesn t make your  well actually    look completely pedantic and pathetic does it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s possible to believe in the necessary use of emergency powers to deal with a crisis and also think that the person that would currently wield those powers is a wannabe authoritarian  Donald Trump doing everything he can to attack the free press and abuse the powers of his office to swing an election in his favorite while regularly obstructing justice has nothing to do with me wanting the president to be able to take drastic action to contain a virus outbreak 
PoliticalDiscussion,From OKC here  Even Okla City occasionally elects Democrats for various offices  ex current Rep Kendra Horn  but it is always red in presidential elections and almost always in gubernatorial elections  From    all of Oklahoma s governors were Democrats  Then Henry Bellmon  R triggered a sea change in  and the state has had only five Democratic governors since  David Hall David Boren George Nigh David Walters and Brad Henry  The other  counties  mostly rural except for Tulsa County are solidly red  I m hoping that some other Democrat preferably named David will run for governor  He might have a chance 
PoliticalDiscussion,The polls seem to have Biden up somewhere from between  points to down  so that s a big spread I d agree that it looks favorable to a switch though 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you think the unemployment has peaked and that things are going to start reopening soon then you simply aren t paying attention This virus is out and it is spreading  exponentially  which means it is fucking everywhere and cases are  doubling every two days The only reason it doesn t look so bad is it takes time for symptoms to develop and we re so short of testing we re missing tons of positive cases  This is not the end this is the beginning The health crises and subsequent economic crisis are going to get worse a lot worse before they get better Any political analysis that isn t predicated on this getting bad isn t a useful one We re about to be the new Italy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Counterpoint Ohio and Iow voted for Obama twice and it s very hard to see either not voting for Trump this time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio is weird Trump really stole Democrats thunder on labor and trade in that state   That being said my family who lives in NE Ohio especially Trumbull country have soured on Trump really badly   Trumbull flipped hard from Blue to Red in    If Democrats ran competent campaigns they could win Ohio I honestly just don t see it happening though  The only one smart enough is Sherrod Brown and for some reason the party media would rather focus on AOC 
PoliticalDiscussion,You might be right but I just feel like eventually even economic policy is going to evolve within the Conservative party precisely because they are conservative I think they will realize that we can t just get rid of social programs and they will need to come up with policies that change the way wealth is distributed to be the most effective and efficient while ensuring a good business environment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t that the pot calling the kettle black  We ve got a mismanaged pandemic because some people were so desperate to disagree with the media scientists that they decided that a pandemic was a hoax 
PoliticalDiscussion,Latest poll has it at a tossup and even Biden by  is dangerously close to a tossup and WAY closer than it should be    
PoliticalDiscussion,That s why the   number is important It shows where his approval is for the public in general regardless of which party people ID as 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Arizona is tossup tilt D Kelly might win by big enough numbers to get Biden over the finish line McSally is extremely unpopular in Arizona 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump s trade wars has hit agriculture hard and his approval there is horrible Iowa is a swing state and the last
PoliticalDiscussion,The only good thing about Cheyenne is how close it is to the Colorado border so you can drive down to Fort Collins or Denver to actually do something interesting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Iowa   The only way Iowa flips is if we have another year like  where democratic turnout is through the roof and republican turnout is way down 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes Biden s leads are specially interesting in these polls Conversely WI polls Trump leading narrowly but I think come election time it s going to swing in the favor of the Dems and Ohio in favor of the GOP Biden winning both OH and WI won t be surprising though 
PoliticalDiscussion, Recent polling  Last poll I saw showed Biden up by  
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure where you re getting your info but this is from Wikipedia   gt The Spanish flu also known as the  flu pandemic   was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic Lasting from January  to December  it infected  million people about a quarter of the world s population at the time   The death toll is estimated to have been anywhere from  million  to  million and possibly as high as  million making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history  BTW According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  antibiotics only treat bacterial infections  not viruses like the coronavirus And ventilators are great but we don t have enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re less likely to believe it s a threat now Let s see what they are saying when total deaths goes over k which it almost certainly will given the rate of spread 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ironic since they gave women the vote before getting statehood 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you think Biden s chances are in Ohio I think Ohio is a very underrated state Trump seems popular here but I think if the economy does not improve that much by November Trump is doomed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believed for years that Sanders was as strong as he was because of his policy positions and his authenticity but after watching him get absolutely slaughtered in Michigan in the  democratic primaries I now believe that he won because he was the Hillary Clinton alternative   I think Biden is going to a much bigger test for Trump than Hillary Clinton I can see PA and MI flipping back Arizona may decide the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is better than one delegate in the primary This would have been a better return than he got 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or even the corollary here  if Democrats are moving from somewhere that place should be getting more republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stop blaming everything on the media damn it You are lazy at proving your points and lack any sources for anything that you have claimied 
PoliticalDiscussion,Devastating indictment of the Democrats They re either unable or unwilling to stand up to Trump Their current frontrunner literally disappeared for an entire week and when he finally showed up again one of the first things he said was that he didn t want to fight with Trump  Trump bungled the response to the coronavirus in numerous and awful ways He personally is responsible for more people becoming infected getting sick and dying and the fact that apparently no Democrat is willing to point this out explains his rising approval rating and really reveals just what feckless dipshits the Democrats are They re useless as an opposition party this should be their moment to show everyone how  self evidently destructive Republican policies are and how their own ideas would be better for the country but they can t even do that 
PoliticalDiscussion,It also highly depends on what the other side is offering
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah yeah I agree with your assessment 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s not much of a rally  Agreed   gt I cannot imagine many independents in most states thinking of risking another term with Trump especially when they have a chance to get back to normalcy with Biden  Biden is in a fundamentally good position If he loses it ll be because of a lackluster campaign and the Republican Party s grip on the media immovable   And those things could very well happen 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Republicans attracting more non whites to their positions  This will definitely happen as the population continues to become less white I have to imagine that when forced they ll begin to make inroads with Latino and East Southeast Asian voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing about the pork is that I think people are willfully looking away from what was actually in it because it s a Sanders wing wet dream not identity politics The main thrust of the pork was that if corporations get relief they had better pass it on to their workers instead of using it for stock buybacks and fucking their workers with lay offs anyway   The problem is optics and ethics That stuff will never pass and it s not a given that it s a good idea in the first place I don t know macroeconomics but I feel like we can t for instance give all workers a  minimum wage if their company took government relief Even if we can that s never going to pass This is a pandemic and the need to pass the relief was dire      And on the other  other hand the Senate has now left until April th so this is all we get for now Maybe that was why Pelosi thought to do the delay I don t know None of this makes much sense to me But I feel like the idea that  they just crammed in identity politics is badly misrepresentation of what actually happened 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry that was confusing I meant to imply that Biden did far and away better in rust belt state primaries thant Hillary even drawing a surge of voters who didn t come out  He did that without much campaigning at all That seems to bode very well for the general and suggests that a lot of white working class moderates sat out or voted Trump in  but are happy to vote for Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wrote this comment on a deleted post But I think it fits here too so    I wish people would realize that this message of Trump s is not smart or factual but I suspect that Trump s messaging over this crisis is actually going to be very relatable to many people in the United States   Truth is no we wont be  open for business by easter unless we want to make this crisis much worse  But we have to be factual here    of Americans dont have  in emergency funds    Even with the economic boost from the government I fear that if this keeps going long enough a lot of people will be hurting   And I think a lot of our most vulnerable would be of the mind that they would rather risk catching COVID  to go back to work and provide for their families Many will feel like they have no choice that if they cant start getting paid they will end up homeless and hungry once all of this passes over   Now I dont agree with Trump on this at all But he is hitting a cord which a lot of people will emphasize with Same as when he was talking about bringing manufacturing back in  It doesnt matter that he is doing so only out of selfish desires that is not how many will see it  We can either do the same as in  and believe that the average voter is intelligent enough to see the reality and the lies Or we can pivot  We need to focus less on the disease at least outwardly We need to focus on offering a path forward towards normalcy before the republicans make this a fight between Trump wanting to  reopen the economy and the democrats talking about flattening the curve and keeping people home   We need a message that we want everything to open up as soon as possible We need to outline our plans to get to that point focus on finding a timetable for that Give people hope that we can both beat this virus and get them back to work after that Outline how we will help them  Its something the democratic party struggles with We all to often talk in political speach  about what will be be best for the country and our goals  while the Republicans run laps around us because they talk about what they will do for the regular man  whether realistic or even true   Take  Clinton spent a lot of time talking about she wanted to see ex industrial workers get retrained and working in other successful fields while Trump was telling that demographic exactly what they wanted to hear that elect him and their jobs would be back and they would be making good money Both are saying basically the same thing but Trump won them over because he was direct They would be employed again making good money For Clinton they had to think about it Retraining What would that mean Other fields What other fields   Why didnt Clinton simply say that her goal was to offer ex industrial folks well paid jobs that would benefit them Because in the democrat lingo that would not be seen as being an actual plan Everything has to be explained Even when doing so puts off the people you want to help Not everyone is interested in nuance  a lot of people just want to hear that we care about their needs and the state of their lives  That said how long will his numbers go up Its not gonna be permanant and once mass death start happening they will go back down But in all reality Trymp can sit up there and keep pushing for everything to open back up as long as he wants but this is a state by state issue and most states will act to protect their residents So it becomes a situation where Trump can say what people want to hear without feeling the pain of his suggestions actually being implimented 
PoliticalDiscussion,Americans aren t very smart and Trump will win reelection 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly Corporate America needs to shed its dead weight
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing is the US economy is not a naturally healthy one its propped up by trickle down economics which has historically proven to only yield a short term boost to the economy but a downturn at the end of many Republican Presidents terms Trickle down economics is a farce of a theory and has not isn t and will never be sustainable 
PoliticalDiscussion,The stock market is an essential metric for tracking the status of the economy If the economy is doing well even superficially the market will for the most part respond accordingly The economy is about to enter a very bad place very soon the bear stock market is reflecting that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pull yourselves up by the straps on the back of your masks Americans 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s in the President s political interests to handle the crisis as best he can  Not really  As in all things political the outcome is not nearly as important as public perception  When I watch him speak tweet I see him mostly just trying to shape public perception  not useful in crisis and doing very little practical work effective or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,You ve seen this in Nevada Vegas is largely democratic and the major population of the state Recently the political rule of thumb is that if you either D R win Washoe County where Reno is located you win the state   As a Reno ite a lot of folks from the Bay Area have moved in and haven t left their more liberal tendencies Reno has pretty much been a   split of Dems and Republicans but you can see an obvious shift in the Federal elections   Nevada is basically blue Constitutional officers excluding the SOS are Dems Legislature is Dem Both U S Senators are Dems and one of the  Congressional members is a Republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s in the President s political interests to handle the crisis as best he can and he seems to understand that Whether he is effective is another question  I suppose he could choose to let the pandemic hit progressive cities hard intentionally out of spite but even then I don t see any evidence of malice State and local officials have more power over what happens in cities anyways 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wisconsin will decide the election AZ FL NC Trump will win again by narrow margins OH and Iowa stay red MI and PA go to Joe WI will be the state to decide it all and I m not sure which way it ll go 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there s an important distinction to be made between people wishing the crisis would get worse to harm Turmp versus people being excited with the possibility that Trump might finally    FINALLY   be held accountable in some way for his lies and incompetence You can take pleasure in hoping Trump pays the price for this without hoping the crisis gets worse Trump has and will continue to do plenty of things to defeat himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Idk about  the Rapture  but it s sure as hell a sign reminding us of who s running the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the correct answer  Both parties are actually progressive in the sense that their views change over time and pretty much always toward the more socially liberal direction  Republicans in  years will probably be a lot like today s social progressives 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like Trump went up like George W Bush was with  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think they re point is that Democrats are perceived as only advocating for identity politics which is unfortunately the only thing that matters   I don t just blindly follow the media narrative  But I do pay attention to how the general media makes me feel and the news from this weekend makes me feel like the Republicans were trying to get a reasonable albeit unideal measure passed and the Democrats were trying to stuff it full of pork  I don t think this is true but I think it s a reasonable view point of the way it s being presented  The thing is I have seen very intelligent political people on reddit say  I don t have to read the primary sources because I don t have time for that I just read a few different sources and get a sense of what s going on for that  That may be a good strategy for climate change but it s not a great strategy for the rest of politics and I think most people blur their ears and listen to the general sense of what the media is saying they don t dig in deeper  Hillary Clinton s entire election was a perfect example of this  There were so many moments where she said and did the right thing but you had to dig underneath the story or watch the original video or read her platform it wasn t grokkable from the collective concious 
PoliticalDiscussion,But realistically people will not stay at home for an unspecified number of time We also can t keep the economy closed forever unless you want worse problems than WuFlu 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming s  tech boom will be in companies building datacenters there to take advantage of cheap wind and solar power Obviously these still require employees to operate but nowhere near as many as the R D offices that people think of when they imagine tech jobs  Personally I think the next phase of the tech boom will be in midwestern states with plenty of colleges but relatively low costs of living Places like Detroit Pittsburgh Milwaukee Cleveland etc will start to attract the midsize tech companies that are being priced out of the labor and real estate markets in SF Seattle LA 
PoliticalDiscussion,RCP has a right leaning bias I go off of  which is pretty neutral and they have his approval at   And not winning the popular vote a second time and winning the electoral college again isnt going to be easily repeated especially with downward economic growth We are at record unemployment numbers today and the fears are no longer about a recession they are about a depression The complete mishandling of this crisis and the plummeting of the economy make Trump a lock to lose and this situation wont be over by summer either  months is the expectation and while Iowa wont be what decides the election it will flip Iowa is incredibly elastic at the presidential level and itll be like  all over again Except this going to be way worse than  million jobs lost It s expected to be  million 
PoliticalDiscussion,that s fine you don t have to agree with decriminalizing the border a lot of smart people don t i m just pointing out that it doesn t mean open borders
PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t Obama come close to carrying South Carolina  Other Deep South states like Alabama and Arkansas are probably never turning blue though Yeah probably Wyoming and Montana either due to gun ownership Can probably forget about Utah and Idaho while you re at it 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s studies suggesting people don t really get more conservative as they age their ideals just stop changing after their s and society gets more progressive which makes them look conservative in comparison by standing still 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t care what any democrat says Texas is not turning  purple  You can also forget about Alabama Arkansas Mississippi and probably Louisiana
PoliticalDiscussion,Alabama 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is why the left right spectrum is so hard to define  In some ways conservative democrats make the most sense to me as the  true conservatives the opposite of which would be libertarians    Out of all the political alignments libertarians would probably introduce the most change and progress into a system  Communists the least  It s what makes US politics so interesting in some ways I think of your typical Republican as being economically liberal and socially conservative  defining  liberal and  conservative simply in terms of change and freedom and Democrats as being economically conservative and socially liberal  I think this opposing alignment in each party is actually what creates balance  Economic conservatism tends to sort of lead to more socially conservative policies as well  So the further you drag the party economically left the more you may turn off those who are more socially liberal  On the flip side there are plenty of Republicans who don t give two shits about social policies they re just there for the free market capitalism and that s impacting young Republicans view of the party 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt One poll is a snapshot in time and his approval is    at the moment    Not a single poll in the RCP average has him lower than  actually   gt It should worry him that his approval hasn t gone positive  Trump doesn t need to win the popular vote to win At  nationally he s likely at    in enough states necessary to carry the electoral college which mean he likely wins even without a polarizing and disliked Democratic nominee This is an old article but it s using the same  figure     gt We are pretty much in a recession and unemployment has hit the highest since  The economic impact is gonna stick no matter what and that is the reason Iowa will flip  I mean maybe It s also possible this metoo thing ends up sinking Biden I can t count it out it just doesn t strike me as very likely But almost certainly Iowa will not be the tipping point state 
PoliticalDiscussion,If it does not then the millions who will die from this plague that trump ignored and spread lies about will be deserved 
PoliticalDiscussion, was a long time ago politically Many former Dems who supported immigration enforcement now favor more open policies  Here is the story I mentioned    
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure but I think labels like left right progressive conservative get confusing when they include economics and social issues I was referring to economic issues 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right now it looks like it s at   which is the highest it s been in awhile    But I was referring to the coronavirus approval I haven t ever seen his overall approval rating at 
PoliticalDiscussion,One poll is a snapshot in time and his approval is   hardly great or impressive It should worry him that his approval hasn t gone positive We are pretty much in a recession and unemployment has hit the highest since  The economic impact is gonna stick no matter what and that is the reason Iowa will flip 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump has never been above  percent So your point doesn t take 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh look your first source congratulations Lol i dont see the problem with keeping it a crime btw 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course it is Creating new job markets is a progressive action as it creates the value of higher education Paying off your debt doesn t create any value it just pays off a debt where if a degree was attained didn t have any job openings for thus why you re in debt 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think one large piece missing from analysis like this is that there are conservatives migrating out of blue states to Red states and I think it might be a higher proportion than many people give credit to   I think people are just moving states a lot Red to red blue to blue blue to red red to blue and every permutation of conservative and liberal in that mix People move to where their lives take them whether it s a new job or an employer moving offices or economic or other social forces encouraging particular classes of people to make particular moves  In the  state to state migrations table that the Census put out it estimated that Texas had the following stats  Population  million   Total inflow from out of state    Total outflow to out of state   So for the net inflow of about  to Texas that doesn t really capture the fact that Texas was involved in about  million people changing states And all in all about  million people changed states that year   And in another data set also from  the Census estimates that  Texas Population  million  note this is different from above   American residents born in Texas  million   Born in Texas and still living in Texas  million   Born in Texas but not living in Texas  million  implied assumes negligible number living overseas Living in Texas but not born in Texas  million  implied  What s also interesting to me is how Republicans have lost a lot of their Latino and Asian voters in recent decades Plus the polarization by education and age of the white electorate has been fascinating as well These are real demographic shifts and they re showing up in different ways  not all favoring one party or the other  
PoliticalDiscussion,And they also stop buying things 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that again you re getting your news from a very filtered source if you believe that Democrats only advocate identity politics This is simply not true and a few minutes of C Span should make this clear   I m also curious why you consider taxing the rich to be an emotional rather than econonic solution Wealth inequality is at almost unprecedented levels and the wealth isn t really trickling down to those who need it it s just sitting around while the ultra rich continue to accrue wealth The GOP and Trump consistently argue in favor of this status quo more than Democrats   And Republicans have been pulled left on some social issues but they are absolutely not the champions of it and thus I find it dubious to hand them credit Their efforts are usually focused upon resisting the next social change    I do agree that Democratic in fighting is very bad I am by no means a moderate I want MA yesterday But the progressive wing has entered into a strange worldview on American politics that has given them a warped view of what each party believes says does and has stamped on their platform The moderates have been no better but having a warped view on the progressive wing is par for the course    There is a rift between the Sanders and Biden wings and there is a chasm between the Sanders and Trump and GOP wings Sanders himself has been trying to point this out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Paying off college debt isn t a regressive action 
PoliticalDiscussion,Once the price of new regulations and debt is calculated airline tickets will go up 
PoliticalDiscussion,I genuinely do not believe your annecdote   Would you mind providing a link to any actual policy that Democrats are on support of that  completely deregulates immigration like you claim  Do you think that you might be completely misrepresenting Democrat policy   After all Democrats passed the secure border act of  the one that funded the existing fence and during the Obama administration the arrival of undocumented immigrants was successfully blocked to the point where there was a net decrease in the number here   Clinton s policy in  was essentially the policy from the Gang of Eight a bipartisan group headed by Marco Rubio and neither of the Democrat front leaders Biden or Sanders seem to have anything that resembles your wild claim 
PoliticalDiscussion,FDR ran on balancing the budget and was a whole lot less progressive on social issues Biden got the sitting President to support gay marriage  called trans rights the next civil rights movement and is a major black alley 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah all that stuff will happen   if we don t do anything about it I used the word  just because even though it s a huge problem it s a straightforward one Again there isn t an underlying inefficiency or misallocation of resources and that is what makes me think fiscal policy is appropriate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats aren t for open borders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Native Texans broke for Beto while migrant Americans broke for Cruz Internal immigrants kept Texas red 
PoliticalDiscussion,Look at  and the trends he had a bump then it goes back to the usual 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hm maybe it s just my phone but I m not seeing that when manipulating the graph Anytime I move the slider it shows he is at the highest he has ever been right now I sure hope I m wrong because I really don t want four more years of this lol
PoliticalDiscussion,When linking something best to make make sure it supports your arguments  Last week either  this week down to  and as old poll results from between the  th fade the worse it gets 
PoliticalDiscussion,Great post the urban suburban and sparse suburban rural split has become a huge cultural and political one in the US   If Biden is basing his campaign on driving the same kind of older urban suburban wave that produced the democratic mid term victory the effect could be smaller Historically mid term turn outs are lower even in the huge turn out in  was  or so points behind   the presidential election nationally and that seems to hold for states like Michigan    in  and   in   The mid term electorate is also more educated and suburban than in presidential ones and includes less  occasional voters  the NYT upshot s famous poll designed to catch occasional voters showed a close race with Biden and Trump with Biden ahead or even but  within the margin of error in most of the battleground states apart form Arizona      Another problem could be that Biden seems to have little enthusiasm among those under  and successful democratic presidential campaigns in the recent past have been about melding the enthusiasm of younger people who volunteer etc with the habitual voting of older ones in the democratic base Biden has time to do this and it seems like less of a problem than Clinton s  paths of least resistance one with non college educated white voters I think there is a lot of talk about surrogates like O rourke on gun control but so far it doesn t seem like making an effort to drive under  enthusiasm and turn out is a large part of his plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,True Will he follow through or is it just talk for the primary s Would Obama have been this progressive or more so if he was running today Seems like he may just be adjusting with the Democratic ideology of the times 
PoliticalDiscussion,Come on rand paul    
PoliticalDiscussion,But how do we get there from here 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see the major urban centers in Tennessee being able to turn the state anything other than a bright shade of red anytime soon I love this state but the people are fucking stupid 
PoliticalDiscussion,All of those can and probably are true and it still doesnt mean that trump has done a good job after calling it a hoax 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hillary did win Minnesota by  point  In a Trump wave election he wins Minnesota and New Hampshire and competes in Colorado and Nevada like Abrams competes in Georgia and Beto competes in Texas    But if Minnesota is flipping there is a very good chance that Biden doesn t have a shot  Conceivably he could win via AZ NC and FL  or AZ NC  of MI PA GA if you really want to go crazy if he were to lose Minnesota but that would be pretty crazy about as crazy as Trump winning in  actually  It would be a similar sort of shock 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dont understand You are talking as if the election is already over and not in  months He will campaign there as soon as people can get out and travel again 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am talking about USA not the whole world     And of course antibiotics doesn t work for viruses but most cases of people dying from corona virus spanish flu didn t just die from the virus but rather co morbidities like secondary infections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed
PoliticalDiscussion,The latest poll for the Des Moines Register  had Trump over Biden   and he s gotten more popular nationally since then 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did Biden really campaign there Or anywhere Or was him being a man enough to bring people who were already moderate Democrats to the polls 
PoliticalDiscussion,There won t be anymore  lesser hit states if they reopen the economy They are just gonna spread the virus quicker
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No cause facts Not hard to understand  Yeah facts at the media stretched as far as they could to make it Trump s fault China lied and that delayed our ability to respond   gt Nice whataboutism in response to your false claim Also that Obama hit wasn t really true Obama addressed the problem of HN early on and declared a public health emergency that same month it rose  They declared it a public health emergency But they waited to declare a national emergency until  months after Not to mention that the response under the Trump administration has been about  times more aggressive I don t recall any stay at home orders during Obama administration
PoliticalDiscussion,Wisconsin also kept reelecting Scott Walker  There also seems to be a general expectation that Trump is going to win Wisconsin 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s much harder with our country   You can look at South Korea and be impressed but that s essentially like saying that Vermont did a good job at containing the virus The United States has a very diverse population with a lot of diverse ideals Nobody is going to agree on how we should handle this and that will make it harder Sweden is a very conservative country and they are all business as usual And that s seen as fine in that country But it s a very small country China also lied to us and that made it less avoidable 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have It is crawling with lowlife Klan members  There are other local economies that deserve our business much more 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes because media    No cause facts Not hard to understand   gt yeah it would be very hard to put that much restriction on an American population that early Like I said if he had tried to force restaurants to do take out only and only allow people to leave their homes for groceries in January people would have thought he was a dictator  Yet every other country is able to do it Mass testing is not hard to do but Trump didn t want to implement mass testing cause he was concerned about numbers and their optics No one would claim that doing mass tests is dictatorial so please stop it with that line   gt Sure but thousands of Americans had died before Obama declared an emergency He waited  months after the st American died before calling an emergency Which makes biden a really awful candidate because they can t use this against Trump now without him sounding like a hypocrite  Nice whataboutism in response to your false claim Also that Obama hit wasn t really true Obama addressed the problem of HN early on and declared a public health emergency that same month it rose      gt Hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine it is a possible treatment we already have  doses and  million more on the way this drug has already gone through all of its testing we know it s safe on humans   It s not clear if it s safe for public use by people with COVID  Clinical tests take a long time to implement to be sure Please stop it with these claims Someone died cause they took Trump s advice on the drug for god sake   gt Trump hasn t been down playing this for a while But he is trying to encourage hope which is his job What did you want him to say  we re all going to die  there is no solution to this problem   Responding like the governors and nearly every other world leader would be a start They are able to calm their people by being blunt and honest Sending false promises of what s going to happen and sending false hopes that the virus would go away  like a miracle one day is just gonna make people more panicky when it doesn t happen   I ll just cut off this conversation here since I don t think there s any way to get through to you at this point Just know that what s gonna happen in the coming weeks and months is Trump s fault That s all I ll have to say 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not like we can t see how other nations handled it and how some succeeded and some  like us are currently failing This wasnt unavoidable  It looks bad because it is bad It was his first real crisis 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think there might be something about OH which works for Biden better than the other Dems Like PA but less so WI is whiter and more rural than OH     Well   Biden s directly from PA and used to be called their third senator which explains his popularity there fairly well I think WI seems to respond well to populist figures economic liberalism is trending very well there which might explain Sanders and Trump s popularity there MI was supposed to be similar but went for Biden though so who knows   gt Trump winning WI and OH wouldn t shock me either  Yeah but I d say that s a little more unlikely to happen than Biden winning both those states    gt My father who is  a lifelong independent and a Biden guy is convinced that the poles are way off and Trump is going to win win Az FL NC VA PA OH WI NH MI Mn but lose the popular vote Rally round the flag  I don t even know if it s even remotely plausible for something like that to happen if Trump s winning all those states he s probably winning in a  Obama esque landslide which won t happen unless something really drastic happens imo because Trump s super divisive and hasn t done much to grow his base from  
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing is you can still put in an effort to check even if you don t believe someone   Yeah the scientists tend to be jerks but on some of what they do you can check their work to a degree  Most conservatives have little to no faith in China s government to do the right thing for their people If China s government will massively damage their economy to save their people it should be setting off massive alarm bells  Let s say  out of  scientists hate Trump That still leaves tons of scientists that like him that could be used to provide him with advice 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well yes but cost of living also goes up when government spending regulation and taxation goes up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cost of living goes up bc salary goes up   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not great for everyone   I ve driven through and kept driving because I value my life They don t offer much for families and they also don t offer much for minorities 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nah 
PoliticalDiscussion,It Shouldn t though Because our testing kits have become more available If anything we should be seeing more because over the last week our testing capacity has increased So no it s not because of testing kits 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m w u pharma bro
PoliticalDiscussion,Naw   People who are self sufficient and aren t interested in govt handouts are more likely to lean red 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see any decline here only rise  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m very comfortable with doing research but our argument was about a very simple thing which is whether decriminalizing the border is the same as opening the border It s frankly not    While most immigration cases are treated as civil or administrative matters the federal government has long prosecuted some cases criminally a trend that has accelerated greatly since the s     Here you go Most cases are civil Deportations happen with civil case The goal is to make all cases civil Deportations will still happen Thus not an open border This has been an interesting exercise in futility but I think I ve wasted enough of my quarantine arguing with one person about this Good bye
PoliticalDiscussion,Where are you getting that     He is doing a lot better 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well yes it s not just Cali but like you said a lot of people are moving to Texas to flee high cost of living and taxes that they voted for in their old states and continue to vote for in Texas 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I just gave a bunch of reasons off the top of my head and I wasn t even trying that hard You don t need to go far in order to find things wrong with his response or to find that he s the one responsible for the mess the country is dealing with now  Yes because media      gt If he instituted mass testing and enact social distancing measures early on then we would ve been able to keep the virus contained like South Korea We didn t do that  yeah it would be very hard to put that much restriction on an American population that early Like I said if he had tried to force restaurants to do take out only and only allow people to leave their homes for groceries in January people would have thought he was a dictator    gt The first American died on Feb  and he downplayed their death and said they were already sick     Sure but thousands of Americans had died before Obama declared an emergency He waited  months after the st American died before calling an emergency Which makes biden a really awful candidate because they can t use this against Trump now without him sounding like a hypocrite    gt And it will take months and a year to get them available to the public   The  vaccine will take about  months to be developed because it s in development Hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine it is a possible treatment we already have  doses and  million more on the way this drug has already gone through all of its testing we know it s safe on humans We just don t know exactly how effective it is on Corona virus patients But it looks very promising It s showing well in test tubes and a lot of people who took it had a good response It should be tested within a week we ll have a better idea of how effective it is  He already sent  to New York for testing It s already being used all over China and several other countries  Trump hasn t been down playing this for a while But he is trying to encourage hope which is his job What did you want him to say  we re all going to die  there is no solution to this problem   We re just going to allow the country to go through a great depression  Several of the medical experts that he works with have come out publicly and said that he is listening very well We ve been promised a plan by the end of the week so hopefully that will give some clarity on the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have lived in colder places I can tunnel through snow 
PoliticalDiscussion,My understanding is that he can t but I m not at all sure he ll comply with any law Just after the election he said  Now I have the military and the police  
PoliticalDiscussion,It does  Suburban demographic voters did not turn out any higher than they did in   White without college voters sat out the midterms 
PoliticalDiscussion,You must really want more people to get sick and die huh 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why unfortunately 
PoliticalDiscussion,No
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the data supports that
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I was thinking more for this election  BUT I do have a feeling this unmasked the REAL GOP for a lot of people I always saw them for the monsters they are but they ve revealed exactly how corrupt they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope he cannot force States to comply
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thinking he means AZ These names get confusing sometimes
PoliticalDiscussion,No but it does say our testing has increased And for the number of infected to slow in percentage but increase in testing is a good sign 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like I guess but did you read the rest of the article It does not paint a pretty picture 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think suburbs trend blue because liberal people move to large cities for work but live in the surrounding suburbs States where there s a lot of suburb but not much density in the center of it will probably not attract those types of people 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d doesn t matter how many people get it if nobody dies If this drug works it could substantially decrease death rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was mainly due to the Trump base not voting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why in your opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good point covid is going to have a HUGE impact on some issues that could otherwise decide the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Restaurants gyms and salons are shut down in Ohio The only thing keeping those employees from being out on the street is unemployment wages and the only thing keeping them from working is government  Because there will be people who will still do hair nails and what have you even if it s a bad idea And there are those who will pay 
PoliticalDiscussion,Macron is enjoying some very high approval as well considering it s France which tends to be a rather combative country   It s also worth considering exactly who makes up those numbers In most cases it s people across the board similarly to   whereas Trump seems to again be inspiring confidence primarily in GOP voters and a couple independents I d be really curious to see his approval rating amongst Democrats Republicans and Independents right now  both overall and regarding how he is handling the crisis  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right on the cuts I got that wrong He only proposed them      I think people right now are rallying around the flag I think they see him right now trying to get a better handle on it which is he doing and during times of crisis people will look to their leaders His support will gradually go up at least initially      However do you acknowledge his initial response was poor As cases get worse and hospitals continue to get overwhelmed across the country there will be pundits and attack ads showing how he delayed his response and ignored the warnings Reaction to Trump is hard to predict he can get away with a lot because his base just doesnt care Hes doing better now  still not great but he genuinely dropped the ball for two months and it is now costing Americans billions of dollars and thousands of lives The severity of this could have been avoided but it wasnt and Democrats should point that out at every opportunity      It regards to the  racism against Chinese thing that was silly I m glad he closed travel to China at the time Just like he shouldn t be blamed for people overdosing on an fish bowl cleaner But that doesnt absolve him of the many mistakes hes made
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be bad business to not charge what the market will bare even if it s just  or  dollars more Why not charge  or  dollars more Limited supply high demand   Well a libertarian would say  with more demand will come more supply as if it s an instantaneous action of the market    Then of course suppliers would price gouge so the markets would need to more so    
PoliticalDiscussion,You should probably just not pay attention to these polls right now They mean nothing until a few weeks before the election Too much can and will change between now and November and this particular election is going to be determined by the death toll and economic fallout of a pandemic It s a unique situation that warps the reliability of polls this far out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah
PoliticalDiscussion, We just hit  worldwide cases with an over  increase in cases in one day nationwide    If you think this is the worst it s going to get you re not understanding the exponential nature of the problem  increase is roughly doubling the number of cases every  days And these test positives that are now showing up are people that were mostly tested a week ago that s how long most of these tests are taking to come through in that time plenty of those people have been walking around infecting even more The  k confirmed cases in the US are only a small piece of the number of people that have it this very second 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump has a team of doctors who say he listens to them And his  response approval rate says otherwise People who hate him for no reason like Reddit are the ones who disagree 
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah they tried to after Romney lost the general and I think that had a huge backlash with Trump They ll have to go back to those efforts at some point
PoliticalDiscussion,How are you taking the  approval rate to his response Few things though people like you called him racist for that response He didn t entirely cut the programs they were moved around And his doctor whose been there for  or  administrations now says he listens to him
PoliticalDiscussion,Please explain how anything but a race to the bottom will occur again 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt When I hear Sanders talk about the establishment I don t interpret that is  Democratic voters  Perhaps others do I don t think he s talking about me my friends my parents etc But he is referring to my Senator most likely  Yeah I ve had a lot of Sanders supporters say this to me This is what happens when you create a faceless monster to attack   So who  is the Democratic establishment elites  The answer turns out to be a number of  elected officials who have a base of support that actually likes them So these voters ask the same question who is Bernie actually talking about  After SC he railed against the establishment trying to hold him back Uhhh what is he saying The voters can t decide for themselves   I think a unity campaign would ve worked much better 
PoliticalDiscussion,After hearing what from Trump about what  But you don t want to the answer to that   Because I HAVE done the research   So yeah sorry that I am accurate in what I am saying  Sucks though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dude you can t believe everything you read on the democratic media That s not what he said And his approval rating on his response is now   They re on China and China alones shoulders
PoliticalDiscussion,People got killed for drinking fish tank cleaner Not because of Trump You need to research things you claim
PoliticalDiscussion,Nevada s Governor for one
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know
PoliticalDiscussion,They were not NY governor could have saved lives if he had responded earlier
PoliticalDiscussion,Very timely podcast    Where Do We Get       Planet Money Duration  Published Thu  Mar     Episode    Media    Podcast    The government s economic rescue package will cost so much it s worth writing out the full number       Where will that money come from And what will happen next        Sent from Podcast Republic   R  
PoliticalDiscussion,When I hear Sanders talk about the establishment I don t interpret that is  Democratic voters  Perhaps others do I don t think he s talking about me my friends my parents etc But he is referring to my Senator    gt but people don t just vote policy they vote for someone they trust and know  That s a good point 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t think you wanted it it just merely a natural evolution Like you said why should doctors risk money now A majority of the people hospitalized are older relying on Medicare and Medicaid Why should doctors help them and risk themselves This virus could seriously kill  of our nation s medical staff Only serve those who can pay extra like a lot extra   Libertarians depend on people being both selfish and selfless and perfect actors with perfect information   I say police state because when you make people desperate they ll do what they have to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do agree that he is being pulled more leftward than he would otherwise be by the current political climate
PoliticalDiscussion,No meta discussion All comments containing meta discussion will be removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it seems as though alot of analysts are noting the same thing Trump got only like a  approval bump when other people like Boris Johnson got like a  approval bump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for starters he would have to try  This   is the perfect summary of why Clyburn and his base didn t really trust Sanders to be the head of the party   Look at Bernie s reaction in the article to the voters He is dismissing them outright as the establishment This is the perfect encapsulation of why the vast majority of Democratic voters rejected him His language is toxic to them Earn the trust and support of good Democrats and the voters will follow    gt I ve seen Clyburn mentioned in Bernie s rural policy page  That s a nice policy position Bernie included but people don t just vote policy they vote for someone they trust and know   Bernie didn t make an effort to get to know these people He basically said  this is my policy take it or leave it  while campaigning negatively 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s also just the simple rallying to the flag that occurs whenever there s a crisis We ve seen it in almost every country hit by the virus with Italy reporting some of the highest if not the highest approval ratings in its history as a democracy Taking that into consideration you could also ask why Trump s bump has been so low  approval of how he s managing the crisis and  overall Compare to   which similarly shook the US to its core and gave Bush an astonishing   approval rating Considering how quickly Bush s approval rating deteriorated afterwards though I d be worried though then again the majority of the people he lost were democrats whereas Trump is already basically at the floor 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We also saw a very nasty economic downturn a couple of years ago  spurred by coal s collapse that went unnoticed by most of the outside world  but was a very big deal here  and we were are still firmly entrenched in our support of Trump Republicans in general  Thanks for this story I ve said it time and again but the Republican base is at the point where they would rather watch the country burn to the ground under Republican rule than prosper under anyone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,What would Bernie have had to do to get Clyburn s endorsement Say nicer things or make substantial policy changes  Not super related but I ve seen Clyburn mentioned in Bernie s rural policy page    gt When we are in White House we will take Rep Jim Clyburn s   approach to federal investments Under this plan at least  of funding for any program would need to go to counties where at least  of the population has lived below the federal poverty level for at least  years These nearly  counties span the rural and racial divide including majority black counties in the deep South predominantly Hispanic counties in the Southwest Native American communities in the West and largely white counties in Appalachia As much as  of the counties targeted by the policy can be defined as rural 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hillary won by   This is not true The final margin was    You are not entitled to your own facts on this subreddit 
PoliticalDiscussion,AR Trump won there by  in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Iowa I d say that out of all the states Biden  could win Iowa is the least likely A win in Ohio is more probable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Building coalitions Instead of throwing red meat to his base by raging about the  establishment and  elites he could ve tried to build a stronger Democratic Party and stronger relationships within the Democratic Party   Think about how powerful Jim Clyburn s endorsement was No it wasn t the only reason why people from SC voted for Biden but it goes to show you a lot of voters actually like their elected officials   When Bernie rages about the establishment or super delegates he is directly indirectly talking about these well liked elected officials   After Nevada Bernie even tweeted he was coming after the Democratic elites or establishment  can t remember which  It rubbed a lot of people in the party the wrong way and Sanders supporters are still scratching their heads trying to figure out why the vast majority of Democratic voters don t want Bernie  Maybe actually try to work with the party you want to be a the leader of 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe rustbelt is not joe Biden It s joe average working dude who has seen the true colors of the billionaire class in the White House Dunno if joe rustbelt will support joe Biden but Biden ain t no Trump Sad it s not Bernie but let s pave the way for AOC Trump and his two more SCOTUS noms will make sure that never happens 
PoliticalDiscussion, was a Trump wave election We won every single state that was supposed to be close I don t think he could hope for better this year 
PoliticalDiscussion,What does  unity campaign mean 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which facts would you like me to back up   That China silenced to doctor who could have stopped all of this      That trump didn t fire the CDC task force here     That he said he hoped for Easter but didn t plan on it here     at Obama waited for thousands to die before finally calling a national emergency He declared a public health emergency but then waited  months before declaring a national emergency    
PoliticalDiscussion,I totally understand your view In this instance when I say  evolve  I mean for Conservatives to gradually change their policies into a new form that would essentially still be  conservative  based on the principles or values that are considered the most important to them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt now favor more open policies  For example    gt While some Democrats have argued for the repeal of the illegal entry statute as the most direct means of quashing Trump s hard line immigration agenda others don t support decriminalization  It s Trump tearing apart families and deliberately harming children that they have a problem with   And anyway   Who cares You think anyone is coming to the epicenter of a pandemic illegally   Does border security matter when there s a disease about to decimate America Mexico and Canada are trying to keep Americans out now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that the left right spectrum is hard to define and I like your analysis although in this day and age I tend to see the political landscape with an added level of complexity  but remember I m just a guy with an opinion    In today s politics I tend to observe and analyze political events primarily through a  populist elitist or  populist technocratic lens before I attach a liberal conservative label I believe that right now you could roughly divide the major political ideologies into four which would consist of a populist left technocratic left technocratic right and a populist right  which I would argue got Trump elected  I would even go so far as to say that the populist left and populist right have many things in common and could potentially be a stronger force than any other I believe this because the populist sides tend to fight for agendas that primarily benefit regular folks On the contrary the technocratic left  which in my view essentially are the Conservative Democrats and the technocratic right  establishment Republicans such as Lindsey Graham  tend to primarily fight for the interests of  elites  albeit not the same  elites  And btw when I say  elites  I don t mean to add any negative connotations to word I m simply referring to what we would consider to be the political economic cultural and media establishments of this country all of which have a great amount of influence in the legislation and direction of this country 
PoliticalDiscussion,Umm no  Republicans and Democrats stayed over the weekend to negotiate the bill  Pelosi blocked it twice  and as of yesterday  times after getting back  It passed unanimously today  You have to skip over  different Democrat obstructions to even get to whatever that article is talking about having happened on the  and th     gt Trump s ire came after the  New York Times changed the original headline on an article  Democrats Block Action on   Trillion Stimulus  to  Democrats Block Action on Stimulus Plan Seeking Worker Protections and then to  Partisan Divide Threatens Deal on Rescue Plan  The coronavirus stimulus package which is designed to help offset potentially catastrophic economic impacts of the virus is still being negotiated   after Senate Democrats blocked a procedural vote on the measure late Sunday    Source    You live in a bubble  You won t come to terms with it  You ll probably vomit another  paragraphs of nonsense at me but there it is  Trumps approval rating    is literally the highest it s ever been and a vast majority of Americans approve his handling of the virus     Gallup Source    The RCP average is closer to  which is still higher than it s ever been  And higher than Obama at this point  And that s before considering we re in what is perhaps the worst crisis of our lifetimes    Reddit and Twitter doesn t reflect real life  Either you ll come to terms with that or have an aneurysm in November  The choice is yours 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden is not Sanders and has spent the primary shitting on his positions every time he could muster the mental capacity to do so It isn t generic Dem against Trump it s Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shaping public perception is critical in a crisis and it s not nefarious when done ethically and effectively  not implying Trump is doing either  Perception is important to encouraging certain public behaviors during and after a crisis such as social distancing and self quarantine  The US government is highly decentralized with practical power delegated to federal agencies The President can order the agencies to do things but it s up to the agency employees themselves to execute commands like shipping out ventilators A legal maneuver like invoking the Defense Authorization Act doesn t physically deliver ventilators to patients in need Much of the President s power derives from the bully pulpit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really awesome information I m really interested in how the suburbs movement to Democrats might be muted by higher turnout In regards to seeing lower enthusiasm amongst under  voters I believe Biden may be correct in not needing to focus too much on increasing that turnout Trump is probably the most unpopular President amongst that age group in modern history and that there will be higher than average turnout with under  voters based on voting against Trump not necessarily for Biden If anything I believe that Biden should avoid actively courting these voters through transparent efforts to relate to the  young crowd I believe he would only lose voters he already had as these voters are turned off by the disingenuous posturing I think this may have hurt Clinton since she primarily focused on the  woke bloc of voters These people will already be motivated to vote against Trump so as long as Biden s message is focused on  I ll beat Trump  these voters will turnout The strategy on turning out more voters in over  and winning over more of that demographic  since it s a larger portion of the electorate is a better use of resources 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s in the President s political interests to handle the crisis as best he can and he seems to understand that   I highly doubt that
PoliticalDiscussion,The complication there is remote work Those other tech hubs are reaching out across the US and they aren t paying differently for people in different states I m in SLC and the cost of developers has exploded due to competition for a limited resources and Silicon Valley paying remote workers here k more Wyoming is well positioned in timezones to serve both the east and west coasts for collaboration 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s governors banning medicine after Trump stated it shows promise that is bad  Source What medicine are they banning Cause I have not seen anything from the CDC NIH WHO or any other medical institute regarding  medicine  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because our testing kits have become more available  Please provide a source for this because I haven t seen anything about this 
PoliticalDiscussion,My hope is Tammy Duckworth 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is specially in regards to constitutional laws for which there is an overlap and neither the states nor the feds is unconstitutional A law that gives the President general executive rule over states as far as I understand it would be unconstitutional So he d need a constitutional law that would fit   
PoliticalDiscussion,What is an Obamaphone 
PoliticalDiscussion,The question becomes what laws do we have on the books during war time  He keeps calling this a war  If we are at war then Federal rules can take over many state rules  I just don t know what those laws are    But he also has the military to back him up but I am not sure if the military leaders will follow him i e which military leaders will follow and which will decide that it is an unlawful order  It could be very bad very fast 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know she s probably too old but I think Warren would probably be the best choice at this point She seems the most capable of generating hype among the voter base apart from Sanders Adding Warren to the ticket might also win over some Sanders voters who wouldn t otherwise support Biden I can t think of any other potential running mates who has real progressive credentials and a following like Warren
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure I agree on the conservative front I would agree with you more back when Scalia was on the bench but Thomas is much more deferential to federal powers so we ll see what ends up happening 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that is entirely possible and as you ve pointed out has been done before That would not be mandating unemployment though it would be mitigating unemployment through federally guaranteed jobs   As previously stated the Feds can withhold future funding but can t do much more than that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks very helpful

PoliticalDiscussion,I doubt it occurred to him to consider what he means 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can imagine the governors saying  then we ll do without your funding  and hoping that a saner president and Senate will come along to reimburse them  Not that they ll be denied funding unless there is a power Congress has already given to the president in some past law that he can use to do that Otherwise Congress would need a new law and the House isn t going to pass anything that take takes funding away from states that are shut down 
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems pretty open and shut especially when you consider the commerce clause   Any business done within a state affects business in another state  thus giving the federal government a degree of oversight over each state s commerce   If I remember correctly it was something about wheat or farming around the time of the New Deal and a Supreme Court threat of Court packing Not entirely positive though 
PoliticalDiscussion,But they already hold fee title to the right of way for US Highways The states are in second place

PoliticalDiscussion,This just brought to mind my memories of L Con Law Are you also a law student or you just like the Constitution  in a real intellectually curious way not the bizarre nearly religious rhetoric but sheer ignorance that the right wing brings to it    Anyway I agree seems like a state police power but the federal government could try an interestate commerce or even a field preemption argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,A government could implement a public works program and then have direct control Not saying they should unless those public works are things that can be worked remotely but direct alleviation of unemployment is something that could be done and was done back when FDR had the Civilian Conservation Corps 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lately this Court has been a rubber stamp for Trump It may be the Liberal bloc that writes a dissenting opinion defending federalism 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s fairly common The Voting Rights Act certainly jumps to mind 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes funding is the only card the Feds really have and they play it well  That is the only likely way would be to reduce funding but I dont think that would be smart in the middle of all this   although with this admin who knows 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They aren t getting more moderate they are getting more extreme Every year they get worse  Cornered animals are the most dangerous 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can someone explain to me how the party of  Small federal governmetn and  states rights wants to put in a policy overriding states rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah the th amendment has an  anti commandeering interpretation  e g    which prevents the federal government from having local police enforce federal laws  e g federal marijuana prohibition federal immigration laws  But this would be the opposite situation where the federal government is trying to guarantee citizens a right to free movement I feel like that would stand up  Not the same but at the state level we just saw the governor of Mississippi overrule the mayors of Mississippi with his own less stringent non essential business closure 
PoliticalDiscussion,Makes sense I do know of a law that makes it such that certain not for profits at the state level would not receive xyz funding unless they do abc The NFPs are free to not do it but then they d lose out in millions of funding That s where the basis of my thought comes from 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand that you didn t mean to conflate  joe rustbelt and Joe Biden I amd not making that conflation either I am stating that Joe Biden has shown that he is for the status quo Washington Consensus and he is still likely to be the candidate here It isn t generic Dem vs Trump it s Biden vs Trump and Biden is not even trying to make the case that he cares about the concerns of working class Americans There s plenty of videos out there of him literally telling working Americans to eat shit and vote for someone else in at least one case literally Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,the states are well within their rights to refuse to enforce or cooperate with the enforcement of drug laws  they just cant stop the feds from enforcing it themselves  Im not a lawyer but im pretty sure it would be quite unconstitutional if the fed s passed a law stating that state governments must enforce those federal laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes Two options   Supremacy clause federal law will always trump state law   Or  forcibly by tying funds to a law or an executive order
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be interesting to read the laws passed with the creation of our interstate highways  I d guess the wording would lead to the feds owning that land so the states are not allowed to limit access 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can t enact or just enforce Most places aren t enforcing their shelter in law places anyway
PoliticalDiscussion,There s  chance of SCOTUS endorses such an interpretation especially with such a conservative bench as we have now Highways are so critical to the US economy that allowing such an interpretation would effectively eliminate any principle of federalism The court wouldn t rule that the federal government can t control highways Rather they would rule they can only do so for extremely narrow purposes Perhaps the feds can take over the highways if they need them to move troops around in time of war or deploy emergency supplies in times of national disaster But such dramatic takeovers would have to have a clear national benefit and purpose 
PoliticalDiscussion,They can find other ways to pressure Alcohol being raised to  wasn t because of a law but because they withheld federal highway for states that didn t raise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isnt the real issue that trumps statement would cause his supporters to defy the orders of governors 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d love to think that but we both know it s just going to be deepfakes of AOC leading a tank brigade towards Washington 
PoliticalDiscussion,So we re good then correct 
PoliticalDiscussion,Couldn t it be argued that the governors aren t doing that Airports roads ports etc are all open for business 
PoliticalDiscussion,We need to see what happens when the bodies hit the floor 
PoliticalDiscussion,He still stayed true to the Republican s beliefs on states rights in this situation tho Never said he s a good hombre 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also  suburban counties votes more Democratic in  than in    Any side swappers have a two vote effect   Most were single digit swaps but over  had a double digit swing   Side note Personally I love Bernie and Warren but I m relieved Biden and a thoroughly competent female VP will be at the top of the ticket 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are always entitled to your own opinion but let s be realistic  Pelosi was trying to get Obamaphones for people and other absolutely stupid shit  on the bill for relief I am not into politics  I think they are all self serving idiots I am going to support the President whomever it may be because that s how I was raised I am not going to pick a side they both have faults 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump did not pass a law the states did Trump can t supersede state laws Trump would have to pass a law to change the status and Congress is not in the mood of legislating laws right now or for years now  In establishing American government s power sharing system of federalism the Bill of Rights th Amendment holds that all rights and powers not specifically reserved to Congress by Article I Section  of the Constitution or to be shared concurrently by the federal and state governments are reserved by either the states or by the people 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has no choice Feds cant override state govs on these orders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because he has no choice in the matter and the states can t rely on him anyway If it were left to Trump COVID would be ten times worse if the states didn t self quarantine Trump s calculus is purely of political measure The country is better served without him 
PoliticalDiscussion,No they could pull funding but states are sovereign as far as how they govern their populace 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m pretty sure it s meaningless 
PoliticalDiscussion,Congress cant mandate a certain amount of people cant be unemployed Mostly because federal or state the government has no control over unemployment   There is absolutely no law or way I can think of for the federal government to do anything to override state s sovereignty 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lifelong Dem and the only reason I could say  Vote Blue No Matter Who was because I knew Tulsi Gabbard didn t have a shot at winning the nomination She d be a disaster 
PoliticalDiscussion,Goodjob finally posting some links to your sources It makes for a better argument    I didn t even realize you talked about China But I agree with this point    He didn t fire the exact CDC Task force but read the rest of the article From the article    Fired may be a strong word but there have been abrupt changes to key national security posts with responsibility for global pandemics More recently the administration has assigned new officials to take leadership roles Afterward he never replaced the pandemic teams    His tweets say otherwise     I didn t even realize you brought up Obama but this seems more like whataboutsim 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sure he s not sure what that means 
PoliticalDiscussion,There isnt much either party can do go fix that realisitically    The economy was built on coal Coals dying off due to advances in clean energy and natgas Democrats will never make a move to revive coals fortune over clean energy  ans Sanders wants to ban both coal and natgas so they arent even acting like it  Republicians wont save coal over gas even if they could and i dont think they can  The solutions are limited from there and get more limited as human conditions are factored in The people there don t want retraining or handouts of that sort The town s arent able to springboard with new companies or industries Most towns built on a single economy don t last and there not much government can do without forcing the issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,The feds have used the commerce clause to outlaw growing and consuming marijuana on your own property this is certainly within their reach That being said it s kind of a moot point I haven t heard any attempts by the Trump administration to overturn any state orders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump could halt interstate commerce though right Could he pull an end around and make it so the only states that could use the US HWY System would be the ones that comply by his orders   I am fairly well versed in the transfer of title chain for the right of way and there is always a stipulation that the US Government controls the use of any highway that is included in their system States counties cities villages and hamlets can have their own road systems but all of those eventually connect to highways that have received enough Federal funding to meet the requirements for maintenance  The road may go from one state to another but other than in the case of bridges over bodies of water that separate states share their authority stops at the border of their state 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not even he s sure what that means to be honest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tulsi would probably draw a whole new demographic to consider Biden imo
PoliticalDiscussion,The only thing I can think of is something tied to federal funding   I e  x number of ppl can not be unemployed due to covid to continue to receive y funding   but that won t get passed in the house   and even it were to   someone like Cuomo is not a pushover 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know That s what he said He sees them as his employees like Congress and Justice If it comes down to an illegal order during martial law I think the military will obey him instead of the Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,They still are he said he d let the states decide on quarantine
PoliticalDiscussion,Article VI Paragraph  of the U S Constitution is commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause It establishes that the federal constitution and federal law generally take precedence over state laws and even state constitutions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Federal agents could still raid those dispensaries  They don t because it would be a cluster fuck but it s not because they can t 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t think of a circumastance where Congress  Both House   Senate passed a bill forcing States to do anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,He can probably shut down the roads not sure about the airports but what would be the point of flying there if you can t leave the airport 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but if the Feds wanted to they could crack down on every single one of them They are choosing not to   For now 
PoliticalDiscussion,He doesn t have the police and he doesn t have any authority to impose this  Doesn t matter what he says or thinks 
PoliticalDiscussion,The number of infected slowly increasing can still be attributed to the lack testing overall 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am pretty sure Trump said in the conference that he would let each state use their own discretion I am not  on what that exactly means 
PoliticalDiscussion,Marijuana is legal at state level but not at federal Many states have a dispensary on every corner Detroit has a ton on  Mile granted they are medical dispenseries and the first recreational ones are just opening now 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has the  authority to convince Republican governors in Republican states to get rid of their quarantine orders but otherwise no Unless Trump has the entire backing of Congress he cannot supersede state laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ooh that would be an interesting case 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shelter in place orders are a police power prerogative reserved to the States by the th Amendment However Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce and travel as well as international travel so there could be an argument that states putting themselves in extended states of quarantine could be unlawfully usurping Federal power especially if Congress passes a law to restart the economy in the middle of the pandemic or the President uses an existing delegated authority to do so   The most likely outcome in the event of a premature federal lifting of quarantine orders would be for governors to tell the Feds to pound sand the Feds sue and then the issue is litigated in the Article III Courts all the while the orders remain in place 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you have that reversed State law can t go against federal as long as it s constitutional   
PoliticalDiscussion,My best guess a temporary bump in the market then it will trend down for a while stabilize then go back up As for the people this will be a shit show but eventually their condition will improve as jobs return But what do I know my opinion and  bucks you can get a coffee 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that s suppression of my first amendment
PoliticalDiscussion,Its unclear if Trump can alone but Trump plus Congress can for sure  For an example of the Federal Government overriding a local government on a health quarantine  San Francisco 
PoliticalDiscussion,He can t enforce a shelter in place nor lift one but the governors should not be able to shut down infrastructure critical to inter state commerce 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope not that he gives a shit Remember when republicans were all about State s right 
PoliticalDiscussion,State s Right s vs Federal Right s Constitution says the federal government can not write laws to supersede state laws Trump can demand but Governor s established shelter in place If Trump had established shelter in place then he could rescind the order and States would scramble to establish a state level shelter in place States are in charge feds are just our shipping clerk 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for being a nurse we need you right now I m in Florida its not too bad and I can work from home so I m good
PoliticalDiscussion,B c states rights on the death penalty and anti abortion but not states right to give people healthcare or climate change 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know there s anything actually on the table It s a hypothetical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cuomo should just figure out how to do and say since the Fed govt is not helping NYS then effective immediately we will stop sending tax money to the Fed govt and use it to help OUR citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely not  States power 
PoliticalDiscussion,   something      something   states rights    something      something   
PoliticalDiscussion,Please  I don t stand by anything Trump doesn t need the benefit of a meek  both sides  everyone does it  
PoliticalDiscussion,You have got to be kidding How about PPACA No Child Left Behind every spending bill since FDR and on and on    It s why so many conservatives are for States rights especially since the Supreme Court nullified all State laws regarding abortion sans legislation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Congress quit giving a damn about the Tenth Amendment about  with Teddy R 
PoliticalDiscussion,That applies to  of American politicians doesn t change Trump s acting in favor of a Republican ideal  I really think the Confederacy tainted the idea of states rights nobody should have the right to own slaves However a midwest farmer is going to have far different wants needs compared to a SF tech guru or a South American corporate cokehead in Miami at the end of the day state governments are far more effective at representing the individual s wants needs vs the federal government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed I think it s going to be late April even May before we get a hold of it I hope I am a nurse so I  am almost expecting to get sick lol what state are you in 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Shelter in place orders are a police power prerogative reserved to the States by the th Amendment   Are they though 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to trump its the governors responsibility to get ventilators and other medical equipment and as long as he refuses to provide New York with medical equipment then it goes without being said that the authority of how to address this pandemic would also lie on the shoulders of the governors not the president 
PoliticalDiscussion,THIS And hopefully it stays in the courts for a year Because that is what we will need 
PoliticalDiscussion,I suppose he could do that That would be a very bold and drastic move though   If he s doing this because lobbyists are in his ear The pushback from the healthcare industry state local governments It would be chaos He d get push back from both parties too  It would get challenged in court As it goes through the courts to whether he could or not I m sure the judge would rule that they rule that the shutdowns remain in place until the case is heard and a ruling is made   The defectiveness of anything he tries to do to overrule states is probably going to get challenged in court regardless By the time a ruling is made the governor s probably would be lifting the shutdowns anyways   The fact were not quite sure of he hss any authority to lift the shutdowns issued by states probably comes to the same result anyways   Maybe a few states will just listen and follow what he wants NY and Cali will not I m sure many others won t either so the impact and effectiveness will likely be negligible 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think he managed the situation as best as anyone could have been The people in charge and the committee running and making the decisions are great In fact everyone in the media criticized him when he made the decisions so early Even Ilhan Omar and Gavin Newsom praised Donald Trump s response Cause it was timely and very well managed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely bottom line is we now have  stimulus measures past social distancing seems to be working testing is becoming more available So things looking up we just need to stay safe and ride this put 
PoliticalDiscussion,Somebody else mentioned her but Gabbard has some progressive credentials The Bernie people might hold the Biden endorsement against her but she might have the added benefit of pulling some people from Trump Probably not gonna happen but it isn t crazy in principle 
PoliticalDiscussion,maybe but if state does like LA and cut off utilities good luck working   
PoliticalDiscussion,She couldn t even make up her mind about impeachment She s not ready to be the president of the united states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Picking a sitting senator comes with potential problems because it opens up a special election In California or Illinois that isn t an issue for Dems but in Minnesota or Nevada or especially Wisconsin it might be So that leaves Duckworth and Harris from your list Other picks might include Stacy Abrams and Michelle Grisham governor of New Mexico  
PoliticalDiscussion,No He has no power at all Except to cause pain He wilk encourage people to go back to work killing some of them but he refuses to do anything to save them  The red state governors are likely to echo his sentiments I am hoping the blue state governors get the national gaurd to stop people from the red states from coming across state lines to get medical care when THEIR hospitals and morgues are full 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry but you are incorrect Executive order and federal law supersede state law All the th amendment says is that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states The supremacy clause IS a power that is delegated to the federal government Look at DACA for example If states could override that by passing state legisltation republican states would have gone away with it already Trump would not have to pass a law he could just sign an executive order 
PoliticalDiscussion,No problem I don t take offense I try to see both sides of the story and honestly I am mostly concerned for the well being of the country Health and financially scary shit   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s all about power and might and Trump does not have it Trump does not control the military in regards to domestic affairs The national guard is under the control of the governors Didn t I just say this Or is there some magic words Trump can say that just completely neuters state governments 
PoliticalDiscussion,Federal always trumps state level Just like  legal marijuana its legal at the certain state level but if the feds decided to shut down the shop and arrest everyone They would definitely have that power On that note if the state is saying one thing and the feds are saying another i guess it comes down to who would actually enforce it 
PoliticalDiscussion,True but in his world it s all about power and might With  M active military and k full time police his  army is bigger than the States  He doesn t let the law get in his way I think he s just warming up   If he loses in  or his term is up in  I just can t see him saying  Well folks it s been an honor but there s a law somewhere that says I have to go now  He s already  joked about revoking term limits And with his co conspirators in Congress the sky s the limit I think it s dangerous to ignore his rhetoric Millions bought it in  
PoliticalDiscussion,You couldn t force people to work but you could allow any willing business owners to operate in defiance of a state level order 
PoliticalDiscussion,What words do you think are trigger words I only asked you to be more specific if I am going to call out mismanagement then I am going to express why I am feeling that way It s simple I am not asking you to do anything but tell me why you feel the way you do is my intent clearer now I am not trying to argue with you I am just trying to understand why you feel that way is it because u don t like Trump or is it something specific to the outbreak 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t disagree with your assessment But one party is preying on fear and the other is offering a path forward The path forward isn t perfect but it s better than devolving into anger  A lot of these towns vote with anger in mind Trust me happened to my home town It s almost as if they want to see others suffer because their town failed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Got it sorry there are millions of people out there watch fox news right now who think the bill was voted against in the senate because the Democrats wanted emission controls arts funding and diversity reporting I thought you were one of them at first 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty sure the Civil Rights Act counts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Could there be dormant commerce clause implications if the State starts operating checkpoints on major thoroughfares to enforce the shelter in place orders I don t feel as though I ve got a great grasp on the dormant commerce clause so I could be way off the mark here 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t really force people to work though even if businesses are open If people are scared because hospitals are full they won t care about what the president says
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody is abiding by the stat at home order so it makes little difference  I had to run into work twice this week and for roads drive through gas stations and businesses were as busy as ever 
PoliticalDiscussion,Great comment   As another Michigan voter I cannot stress this enough   HILLARY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO WIN MICHIGAN   She never campaigned here Not during the primary nor the general She was too focused on long shot attempts to turn red states purple because she assumed like an idiot that Trump would be easy to beat Hillary basically used her time trying to run up the score in a game she wasn t even winning She was building hotels on Mediterranean and Baltic avenues when she should have been buying the yellow and green properties 
PoliticalDiscussion,Was overturned by reinquist and the parallel to quarantine is dubious while the fed has power over trade health is traditionally reserved to states the fda only covers trade of drugs and medical boards are all state based 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sauce 
PoliticalDiscussion,States rights aren t an exclusive to modern day political parties      He isn t staying true to anything but his own political survival 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have and I ve decided that being a lawyer would be a poor fit I d have a really hard time coping with all of the necessary reading 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve followed him since living in NYC in the s and he operates on fear like a mob boss He gets personal and I think Congress is afraid of him I think the military is even more inclined to fall in line A soldier serves whoever their superior is all the way up the chain I think it s easy to see his motivations Anyway I hope I m wrong Cheers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thing is I don t think there is any funding lever the executive branch alone has the power to pull that a state will care about in the middle of the crisis Most of the money states get from the federal government comes through spending bills from Congress and Congress will NEVER pass a funding bill against states trying to stop a pandemic Which means the only funds that matter are those directly under executive control and while some of those might be substantial they aren t going to outweigh the cost of a state that tries to pretend all is well in the midst of a pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is exactly right   Just to add on my own little two cents a commerce clause decision here would be complete bullshit Unless governors were mandating travel limits to from other specific  or maybe not even specific states there s no good justification for the feds to complain that the states are abusing their implied powers 
PoliticalDiscussion,So this means  Produce to the stores but no one to buy it And oil production and transport but no demand  Am I understanding the inter state commerce in this context 
PoliticalDiscussion,I get it You didn t have to explain It s a joke some of the stuff they wanted to spend money on I just don t agree on some of the things they were asking and that is my opinion Have we not learned anything from the last bailout  
PoliticalDiscussion,Then why bring trigger words into the discussion about federalism Your intent is unclear
PoliticalDiscussion,I would love to see the party of  states rights try to overrule state governors 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because cities are the creation of states There is no federalism within states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Man oh man that would be something to see wouldn t it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree I can imagine that a lot of people won t want to go back to a daily commute once this ends 
PoliticalDiscussion,Following your own rabbit hole everyone is slightly off on the details  This is the source cited in the only mention of a national quarantine      gt   Congress in  adopted the Rayner Harris National Quarantine Act which set up procedures for the medical inspection of immigrants and permitted the president to suspend immigration on a temporary basis    Most importantly this was   in response to a cholera epidemic that began in India in   and didn t subside until   So timeline is     Cholera pandemic begins in India    cholera pandemic   US passes Rayner Harris National Quarantine Act   Cholera pandemic subsides    San Francisco bubonic plague outbreak begins      Federal government threatens national quarantine  utilizing the recently passed law amidst controversy surrounding the California governor refusing to act  No mention of this coming to pass  Trying to find details on the Rayner Harris Act   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s what conservatives call the cheap cellphone with very limited minutes that the poor can get via government assistance They see it as an example of socialism at work since the said poor person who now has the ability to call  did not pay for the phone themselves Meanwhile they are cheering  billion to bail out of a cruise ship operator incorporated in Liberia 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We ve got a mismanaged pandemic because some people were so desperate to disagree with the media scientists that they decided that a pandemic was a hoax  the WHO refused to call it all pandemic just a couple months ago and kept praising how China was handling the containment of the virus very well The same WHO who mocked Trump s travel ban calling it  unnecessary 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s awesome you have a good grasp of how to handle this constitutional law hypo Have you ever thought about law school 
PoliticalDiscussion,No he doesn t That s state based He could advise it but a Governor could just tell him to blow it out his ass 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump rambles a lot and you would never accuse him of using precise language  But yeah he is talking about the guidelines       New more tailored guidelines will help governors and other state       policymakers decide on  maintaining increasing or relaxing social       distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place        Trump wrote   
PoliticalDiscussion,If they do that is one giant burden for the GOP to bare in addition to what ever else they are carrying
PoliticalDiscussion,Really quick does anyone approve or disapprove what their local state government is doing  I am curious to know how people feel about this 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the draft bill Pelosi released was separate from the bill being voted in the Senate that had already failed to get the required votes on  days before Pelosi released a house version of the bill The initial vote on the Senate bill failed because of lack of oversight on  billion dollars going to a treasury department run by one of the biggest fraudsters of the last financial crisis Steve Mnuchin The Senate bill was also held up on Wednesday because lindsay Graham and Ben Sasse wanted to revise the section on unemployment benefits Pelosi had a draft bill written because Democrats had not been allowed in talks about the phase  stimulus bill until congressional Republicans and the white house had already written it A draft bill written by Democrats in the house only of course included some things that they want like assistance for the poor with telecommunications emissions standards etc I wish Pelosi or someone else had removed anything not virus response related from the draft bill but it was only a draft bill and actually put additional pressure on the Senate to pass the bill that was on the senate floor for a vote The house wrote  stimulus Bill s that are now law and very quickly had them through the Senate and signed by the president because they worked with house and Senate Republicans while drafting them McConnell decided to write the larger Senate stimulus bill with Republicans and the White House only and bring senate Democrats in to talk about amendments with only  hours before it would be voted on which of course is not alot of time since the bill was written with no democratic input Pelosi made a pr mistake by releasing the draft house bill with emission standards diversity reporting requirements etc in it but don t believe the fox news stories saying that this stuff was in the senate bill or holding up the vote on the senate bill Pelosi has pledged to have a vote on the Senate bill not the house draft bill asap 
PoliticalDiscussion,That reminds me in Chicago Midway airport they have an amnesty box to throw away marijuana The legal status is very strange 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t all politicians do that 
PoliticalDiscussion,What One was literally a Spanish speaking immigrant with a translator one was a known local Iowan journalist who regularly caucused for Dems and was caucusing for Inslee because of climate change and the third most well known was a union auto worker   Joe Biden is a boat anchor around your party s neck and you re letting him drag you down 
PoliticalDiscussion, Do whatever you want If it s a good idea I ll take credit If it s a bad idea I ll throw you under the bus  
PoliticalDiscussion,States get a lot of money from the federal government Threatening to withhold Medicare funds for example may be used for coercion It s been done with highway funds in the past 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yep seen the Trumpette ambushes I d tell those sham artists to f ck off too Good for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I said I see you as my employee that doesn t mean you re gonna feel compelled to do my housework for me  That isn t how it works  The military serves the country not the president  There is no reason to believe that what you re saying is true  You re attributing powers and motivations to Trump that he does not have 
PoliticalDiscussion,  Racism and discrimination lawsuit
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not how stats work The number of infected arr increasing at slower rates even though our testing capacity has increased 
PoliticalDiscussion,Centrists aren t worth debating with 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Trump does not have that authority States are allowed to have their own states of emergency as their governers see fit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Republicans cracked the code a long time ago convince your base to ignore the entirety of the mainstream media and cry bias until they will repeat every lie accusation and bullshit you come up with  It s why we heard about Hillary s emails Obama s birth certificate Bills affair ad nauseum   Republicans Trump in particular are fantastic at controlling the narrative Remember how much the media cared about debt and fiscal conservatism during Obama s presidency  Ya ever wonder why they stopped caring when Trump was elected   You see any headlines about us cracking a trillion dollar deficit this year And this was before the corona virus   Nah Just remember who generates headlines 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pls elaborate or link to article I ve googled variations of  San Francisco quarantine congress   law   overrule  and come up empty
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a law hobbyist and hang out on the r law sub a lot 
PoliticalDiscussion,And it got overturned by SCOTUS in  Lopez in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok   like I said everyone is entitled to their own opinion but if you are going to say he has mismanaged things you have to be a little more specific   especially when local governments are in charge of making most decisions I support my Governor she is doing amazing I really don t want to get into a political discussion  there are things about both parties I don t agree with and that s my personal opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,An option I m not seeing discussed is the possibility of Trump using the Defense Production Act or something similar to force businesses to open back up  Could he not declare that all business are critical to national defense and that they are required by law to reopen That would seem to supersede any state order It wouldn t be the first time Trump has used  national security as a dubious excuse like when he enacted tariffs on Canadian steel supposedly for national security purposes 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am sure it means do what you want but I will be angry about it and punish you when I get the chance  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re not wrong the graph shows the exact opposite of what OP said 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes exactly The DEA or FBI or other federal enforcement agencies are  in their rights to go to marijuana dispensaries arrest everyone and seize everything that isn t nailed down The DOJ is well within their rights to press charges on a variety of different crimes to the people who own and or operate these storefronts and various other marijuana related jobs But they can t make the local PD do shit      It does create some interesting situations People can t take weed with them on planes for instance and if you were in california and you were found with marijuana while trying to board a flight  at least one out of state  TSA would detain you and probably seize your marijuana They would then call local PD who would show up and tell the TSA that nothing you did was illegal and you re free to go At least this is my understanding from what my California friends tell me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol it s when Obama was president and we were in a recession they thought it would be a great idea to give cell phones out for anyone who was under the FPL  disabled homeless on food stamps etc in fact in my state they still have a different program that s closely related It was a total shit show Waste of government money that could have went somewhere else I used to work as a Nurse in a drug rehab and everyone in that place had a phone they gave the nickname  Obamaphones   Because everyone was able to get one and sell them or use them for dealing It was a complete joke 
PoliticalDiscussion,He can t force states to lift quarantine What he can do is open federal courts social security offices and other institutions under federal purview Beyond that he could try to condition federal funds or disaster aid on whether or not governors lift quarantine but I m not sure if he has any legal authority to do that   The easiest and most immediate thing would be for him to just tell people to disregard state lockdown orders and go about their usual business He d dare the states to take steps to forcibly enforce the quarantines and things could get ugly   I suppose if he went truly off the deep end he could try to take control of certain areas with the justification that this is necessary to lead the country in  war against the virus but thar would be a real stretch
PoliticalDiscussion,So when he says he want everyone to go mass on Easter he s really saying  I want the guidelines to say everyone should go to mass on Easter  That s definitely not the tone nor the manner in which he s saying it but I ll agree he could be saying x and meaning y 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s this case     The court ruled that growing wheat on your farm to feed your animals fell under interstate commerce because it affected how much wheat you d buy on the open market  because while an individual doing it would be pretty negligible if a bunch of farmers did it it would have a major affect  A lot of the last  years of US legal precedent is built on top of this
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t it just be strict scrutiny and if states can prove that it s the least restrictive means they should be fine 
PoliticalDiscussion,You might want to at least be more discerning than they both have faults Trump is clearly mismanaging the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed I think there s a legit demographic that  is positioned to the right of current Biden but does not favorably view Trump Tulsi was the only Democratic option for these people from what I ve seen I m kind of in this group I ve very often seen this demographic be dismissed as one full of people who would vote Trump anyway but I don t fully buy that 
PoliticalDiscussion,No  He s never discussed anything like that  He s talking about revising the White House s  guidelines  
PoliticalDiscussion,Grip on the media are you serious Yeah they have Fox News and talk radio but it s not like liberals and progressives don t have a large media presence 
PoliticalDiscussion,The ability to pull funding to get states to do something is quite limited The funding must be directly related to the action the federal government is asking for and the amount of finding withheld cannot be so much as to be coercive 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does the president have the power to just   declare martial law and impose his will upon the states by force Isn t that why Governors have control of the national guard of their own states to prevent such a tyranny from taking place   Unless Trump has the ability to actually project the power he claims to wield he doesn t have the power he claims to wield his words are piss in the wind effectively This is why I often tell people to ignore Trump s    interesting verbiage because he often completely misunderstands the situation as it exists and thus whatever he says simply isn t true or relevant 
PoliticalDiscussion,Funny how you seem to imply that progressive ideas form the scientific consensus as opposed to the other way around
PoliticalDiscussion,They override state laws which is in their purview 
PoliticalDiscussion,When I say Strasserite for the record I mean the  fuck identity politics wing that discounts poc queer feminist issues as being pointless or distractions from working class issues not stuff like being pro marijuana or whatever I m right there with you I have friends who have spent  years in jail because of drug conviction and it pisses me off 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like he called it a hoax and said it was going to go away in a couple of days before it became the worse health crisis in  years   and like he didn t ensure when had enough tests or masks   and how he continually puts out misinformation or like how he is talking about about everything for business in a couple of weeks which would cause a spike in cases and quite literally cause thousands of extra deaths     How about you research this on your own It s literally in the headlines every day You can watch the videos of Trump giving press conferences You can listen to his own administration s health leaders talk about how they re frustrated with him and the bullshit he say You can look at the testing rates here versus South Korea for instance and see how much better it s been managed    
PoliticalDiscussion,As George Carlin said they only care about the unborn Once your born your fucked 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just wait until we get a situation where those unborn babies get in the way of the economy Then they ll call for mass abortions and daily fetus sacrifice rituals in order to please the Almighty Dow Jones 
PoliticalDiscussion,The federal government has overridden state sovereignty when it came to things like integration 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would that be the  people who voted for Tulsi demographic 
PoliticalDiscussion,The federal government says I can t smoke pot but here I am in California getting it delivered to my door so    
PoliticalDiscussion,They claim to care about unborn babies lives    But you re mostly correct 
PoliticalDiscussion,State sovereignty is a big deal in this country  for obvious reasons I e founders were no huge fans of the federal government    Is it an issue that could go to court Absolutely I think the state wins all day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but we re talking about the case of a republican in office here Things like states rights the protection of life and fiscal responsibility don t mean anything anymore 
PoliticalDiscussion,That could potentially be considered overly coercive Mandating states increase their Medicaid eligibility with the Federal government picking up most of the spending was ruled unconstitutional It s easier to offer money to do actions than it is to withhold it if you don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is pretty much it  Like it would take zero political capital for Biden to come out in favor of recreational cannabis legalization  That would arguably  generate political capital for him  But he won t make the move despite that it would being thousands of us into the solid blue fold  Why won t the center make simple nigh costless moves to try to court us  I don t know the answer but I do know that every single Democrat I ve ever voted for in a presidential election has continued the policies that led police to shoot my friend dead in his own living room over weed and that continuing those policies has won them absolutely no electoral ground while costing them a lot  It might seem Strasserite from your perspective but to me it really feels like the DNC is only as progressive as we on the far left force them to be and will revert to conservatism at any opportunity unless we force their focus away from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Governors have actually been getting high marks for their actions so far about  points higher than Trump in one poll where Trump had  approval and the governors   
PoliticalDiscussion,Apparently not but if you think that some states won t play along you ll have another thing coming This is the guy who pressured his own party to acquit him just last month on obvious crimes with Ukraine They knew what he did was wrong but they let him off anyways cause if they didn t it d hurt them politically Cuomo will likely not reopen New York but DeSantis might so it ll be a mixed bag   Also there s the possibility that Trump may decide to attach strings to things like medical supply aid in order to force even blue states to try to reopen They ve been desperate for those supplies and Trump does have authority over their distribution Sounds cruel but then again we ve kinda already passed that line already 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama Care Federal tobacco age Any drug law Federal fire arms acts Endangered species act Americans with disabilities act 
PoliticalDiscussion,Blind loyalty is not patriotism It does a disservice to the nation  We must question every leader regardless of party  the president most of all given the extreme power we have afforded that position 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wickard was also pretty explicitly reaffirmed as it relates to commerce since then in Gonzales 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think expecting to have solid statistics on how important people think it is to end a prohibition is kinda silly  I still don t even openly talk about cannabis on FB for example for fear that my state police might arrest me or come to my house for a shakedown  It s a much bigger issue than people on the outside think  Especially to swing and or apathetic voters  Potheads will see Harris as the VP nom and stay home bottom line  That s not what we want but likely is what we ll get 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes of course he does The executive branch can overrule states It s in the constitution
PoliticalDiscussion,Tying the drinking age to federal highway dollars is all I can think of 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m guessing it means he ll bully them on twitter and withhold medical supplies that they ve been begging for until they  decide to reopen their economies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Harris was pro legalization in her campaign her prosecutorial record ain t pretty but if she s VP I doubt she d go out of her way to stop a descheduling or legalization   I seriously doubt marijuana single issue voters are any significant portion of the base unless you re being very generous and including all prison judicial reform voters even then it s not top ten among issues afaik 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure if he s said he s overriding states and opening them up against their will What I heard in today s briefing is they re reviewing things and will send out new   guidance   Guidance to me isn t the equivalent of a law nor is it a  you must do order  Why not just wait and see Regardless of whether you like him or not I feel like we spend WAY too much time hypothesizing what he might or might not do based on vague language People should learn by now to just wait until actions are taken and not to read too much into the rambling up to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,You might have a bit broader perspective on the Sanders specific base then I notably didn t actively participate in his campaign although I did vote for him in the primary both  and   and my on and offline circles notably see Sanders more as a step in the right direction and don t buy as much into the cult of personality that surrounds him I agree a lot of us would be more willing to step up for the DNC if they did literally anything to court us besides think poc and queer people should be allowed to live which is a big big piece for the record the weird Strasserite undercurrent a lot of popular leftists have is very concerning  
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao
PoliticalDiscussion,It s difference and any second rate lawyer could tell you that And I should know   I m a second rate lawyer  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes because governors are part of the executive branch and the President is the CEO of the executive branch They have to do what he says or he can have them court martialed and shot to death for disobeying 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Federal always trumps state level  That s not how federalism works 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve seen a lot of people claim  shelter in place orders are unconstitutional but not much in terms of explaining how such public health orders are unconstitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sounds like a great way to revisit the commerce clause decision  Not going to happen but a guy can dream 
PoliticalDiscussion,No he doesn t don t panic
PoliticalDiscussion,As a Sanders supporter I can tell you that there are a shitload of my fellow supporters who plan to vote P in the general leave the presidential spot blank and vote downticket or to write in Sanders  Nearly every person I have talked to about the idea of a Biden Sanders ticket says they d go vote and a significant number said they would campaign for such a ticket  This isn t some article of theory we ve been discussing it pretty heavily in the pro Sanders circles and the general consensus is that about  of Sanders supporters are guaranteed to Vote Blue about  of Sanders supporters are Never Blue and the remaining  are willing to vote Blue but are so fucking disheartened and feel so completely shat upon by the DNC that they won t unless some motion is made to indicate that they re anything more than the  Gail the Snail of the DNC 
PoliticalDiscussion,This might make this question a little harder to answer but it is worth trying to understand a coplex situation It all boils down th the Stanford Act and its interpretation    Good Reading for the intellect on this crazy situation        Explainer National Emergency Declarations and COVID                                                          the  Federal Government Override State Government Rules on Social Distancing to promote the Economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Governors take the lead in the fight against coronavirus                                                                             
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not saying it will happen overnight I m just saying don t say never With growth comes change is all I m saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why  I m guessing people from the other side aren t worth debating either   which means the only thing  worth it is staying in an echo chamber 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whatever you say buddy 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re more like guidelines than actual rules 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is laughable Greenville SC is one of the most solidly Republican counties in the country GOP in every presidential election since  In  it went for Romney at    for Trump at   The mayor  which in almost every major city in the country is a Democrat is a Republican who has been in power since    In the biggest wave for Democrats in recent history the Congressional race for an open seat was  to  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt wants to put in a policy  We re not at the point where the federal government is saying that s even advisable much less coercing the states into it 
PoliticalDiscussion,One possible outcome after this virus blows over like every other one in history has done The Dems lose the house because of the impeachment sham The Donald crushes old Joe when Joe can t remember he is running for president The result Trump reelected with both houses of congress Republican  That is only one possible outcome don t jump off the bridge yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,For the record I am a leftist and I m politically active in leftist progressive circles both locally and online I ll be the first to admit that my perspective is skewed but absolutely my friends on and offline have fallen into three categories    I hate the DNC but Trump is worse so  votebluenomatterwho    The DNC keep thinking they can ignore progressives and we ll keep voting for them because the other guy is worse but at some point something has got to give so fuck em    Nothing I do matters anyways so why should I care  I guess you re right that some of the second group would probably be swayed by a Sanders VP but I dunno I just don t really see it In any case you re right that Biden went for the  girlboss demographic instead which is just as baffling since all those voters were gonna vote for him anyways 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the safe link program started in  Obama took office in  and it blew up because of the recession in  but that s besides the point during the last stimulus bill back there was a ton Unnecessary spending And we don t need to give out unnecessary crap We need to learn from mistakes not repeat them 
PoliticalDiscussion,As usual wheneve r Republicans submit a  crisis bill or  emergency aid  it s just a blatant cash giveaway to them and their cronies      for Mnuchin to throw around as he pleases with the only oversight being Trump himself  Yeah gimme a break  The Republicans knew this would never pass and the Dems fucked up by allowing them to present their bill first  Whoever was the first to fire a shot in the form of submittring a bill the other side would reject was going to win the optics battle by painting the other side as obstructionist in a time of crisis  Fortunately we re getting to a point where the Dems are tribalizing just as hard as the Reps so they no longer get taken in by this kind of bullshit nearly as frequently  This will die in the house and the Dems bill will die in the Senate without a vote  Nothing will be done and we ll go into the crisis without any action until it s too late  My mom will likely be one of those people who I don t get to hold a funeral for like in Italy once the spread of the virus hits the states full force  This is just the reality we ve allowed ourselves to slip into by playing democratic games with Conservatives instead of cutting them out of society like the tumor they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,As I recall the FAA shut down all of the airports in the country on   
PoliticalDiscussion,Congress  essentially forced states to enact a  mph speed limit and  year old drinking age I think they did both by threatening to take away highway funds from states that didn t comply 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s terrible about Massachusetts stay safe and good night
PoliticalDiscussion,I was going to say it means nothing because he constantly lies and changes his positions but you ve got a point He ll definitely use anything to inflate his anger and retaliate against his non base
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Effectively sacking the pothead vote with Harris  That s a bigger vote than people realize 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea mass and conn are exploding with cases We have around  Massachusetts has  nurses who are infected so it s really scary I live on the mass  R I border It s a nice place in the summer other than that ur not missing much We didn t even really get snow this year so it s been a weird year already I can t wait for the sunshine   Well gotta got the bed stay safe talk to ya again sometime My name is Kim Night 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt and the progressives who won t vote for Biden won t support him for the variety of well established reasons anyways they d just say Bernie sold out instead  I think a whole lot of folks like to characterize what Sanders supporters would do and that when y all do it we Sanders supporters typically respond with  wat   If the ticket was Biden Sanders you d get almost all of Sanders supporters  We really are much more workable than so many people seem to think  It s just that the center tends to piss on our heads and expect us to call it a favor  I d at least like too see the center left do  something to try to win over the far left before they just write us off as unwinnable  The reality is that many of us on the far left just don t believe there s been any sincere efforts to make a place for us in the Democratic Party  Nominating Sanders would have been a shattering spike to that idea  But it s too late now Biden would rather try too court the  we vote for women vote than to court the poor or far left vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats the wrong question The question is does a govenor have the authority to issue a stay at home order  No No they don t Get fucked statists 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can look at governor approval ratings as a proxy  Most governors are looking pretty good at responding to covid    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Can someone explain to me how the party of  Small federal governmetn and  states rights wants to put in a policy overriding states rights  Simple  They never actually held those values but merely used them as tools to accomplish the goals they had  usually for their benefit or the benefit of the rich friends  
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump like any other dictator can only  do what people will follow  I for one will listen to my local authorities over him any day of the week and twice on Sunday  I d sooner take  orders from my neighbors poodle should she ever start talking  What Trump needs is a stint of people around him  especially experts looking him in the face and saying  No  Sorry sir we will not be doing that  Ever  
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve seen people complain that the state governors telling businesses to shut down for  days is a ridiculous violation of the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,But they started giving out cell phones under the Bush administration as part of a programme started under the Reagan administration 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imo and legally in the environmental field no The most stringent rule applies 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s funny how the Republicans want state s rights until they don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I m hunkered down in the house I m in northern Florida and its not bad yet just alot things closed Never been to Rhode island you can definitely have the warmth it s been  and humid all week here 
PoliticalDiscussion,No we can t but we can kind of guesstimate how long the stimulus package will last if we continue under current conditions
PoliticalDiscussion,The closest to this that I can think of and I ll admit it s a VERY distant cousin was when Obama threatened to send DEA into Colorado after they legalized pot and the governor threatened to jail the DEA None of it ever came to pass though    I think the takeaway is whatever will be will be and the courts will clean it up after the fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oof it was interesting to watch Dr Birx and company dodge the question twice about how they will prevent potential county to county and state to state travel of infected people I believe their answer was something along the lines of  the counties will have to communicate  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh god I guess the propaganda brainwashed you too I ll just leave it here    
PoliticalDiscussion,The IRS collects those taxes There is no middleman 
PoliticalDiscussion,How do you figure 
PoliticalDiscussion,People suggesting Gabbard are out of their minds  Duckworth is a repeat of the Kerry  playbook of trying to out patriotism the GOP Didn t work then won t work now He s just going to pick Harris guys no need to overthink it 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is muddy waters but I would say no That s why even though it s a federal crime to use pot certain states have legalized it States technically have the final say but like I said it really just depends on whose doing what and if they have back up from others the courts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would they 
PoliticalDiscussion,he spent  weeks claiming it was a hoax the only reason he stacks up well to anyone is because we are comparing him to bolsonaro
PoliticalDiscussion,So the goal posts moved from me proving my point to you making the conversation about Trump and coronavirus   Funny how that always seems to happen
PoliticalDiscussion,Because instead of Trump conforming to the Republican establishment Trump forced the establishment to conform to him He s got an approval rating in the s among Republican voters The Republicans in Congress are basically held hostage 
PoliticalDiscussion,But who collects those taxes  Fed direct from companies  I figured Cuomo could rebel to make Trump try and sue him  Guess not damn 
PoliticalDiscussion,To the left Honestly no one Even if Bernie miraculous comes out as transgender tomorrow and Biden puts her on the ticket it would do nothing The progressives who would vote for Biden are voting for him to stop Trump and the VP doesn t matter to them and the progressives who won t vote for Biden won t support him for the variety of well established reasons anyways they d just say Bernie sold out instead  Which leaves the people to the right The Trump wing won t ever vote for anyone but Trump even if he personally went out and murdered their entire families in front of them So you need to get the narrow margin of people who either didn t vote in  because they didn t like either choice or the centrists who probably just don t like Trump as a person I personally don t have a good grasp on either of those groups but I imagine it d have to be someone with decent name recognition and strong charisma They also have to be younger since even Biden himself has said he needs someone who could competently take the reigns should he croak   All in all its a really tough order and I don t actually think there is a winning answer for him If I had to guess Abrams and Duckworth would be the two with the best shot of swinging votes but I really don t know 
PoliticalDiscussion,IANAL but it seems he could have the Justice Department call it a civil rights violation and go to court to get an injunction Then it s up to the judge 
PoliticalDiscussion,don t be so critical there s two sides to that issue
PoliticalDiscussion,Except the state of New York is not a proxy for sending money to the federal government States don t pay taxes the people in those states do and since they can t stop federal enforcement of federal tax law there isn t really anything here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely not the best person to ask about this but just off of some quick browsing it would seem like the dormant clause could honestly be used as a defense for the states against commerce clause suits because they re applying their own stay at home orders equally to all states Like if New York were to say nobody can come in or out without clearance would be applying the same laws they use internally onto people attempting to enter It would be wrong on the other hand for a more relaxed state to say nobody from a strict state can come in  Just my general impression At this point I only dabble in con law going to law school in the fall 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I would say our economy is currently running at about half steam  There s no way to measure this until jobs data or better figures come out Even the current unemployment data isn t indicative of the present situation since they start at a date before widespread state lockdowns We are still in the fog of war right now and this legislature can t and won t be the last since it has been passed and written with imperfect information We ll know more by mid April Noone can say with certainty what the economic state of the country is right now since the data just doesn t exist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,It depends on if people think he handles it badly Media certainly thinks he isn t handling it well but media isn t usually representative of the people
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh thank you I appreciate that I am in R I send us some warmth It actually wasn t too cold today  degrees I could never work from home I wouldn t be disciplined enough but good for you  They are saying that Florida is a disaster zone  Be careful    Are you locked down 
PoliticalDiscussion,NO thankfully   Some of these Governor s are doing the right thing great job  Other s like DeSantis need to step it up and CLOSE IT SDOWN    Thankfully here in NYC we have Cuomo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump says a lot of things and just hopes they mean something 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t be so sure about Texas a lot of Republicans from blue states actually move there Similar concept as Florida Texas has sort of two forces pushing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I could see him trying this getting slapped down then trying to reopen certain industries in a more targeted way and succeeding Similar to how things went with the travel ban  I think he has more power here than a lot of other people think especially if he can get judges on his side 
PoliticalDiscussion,Counterpoint in the aca attempting to hold up Medicaid funds to compel the expansion was ruled unconstitutional  Could go either way depending on the level of funding
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t Anyone who actually wants states rights and small government doesn t want it either if they aren t too busy worshiping Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,So our GDP before the outbreak was about  trillion annually Which is about  trillion per month The  trillion is effectively being taken from billionaires in the form of a loan  or bond  I would say our economy is currently running at about half steam So the two trillion dollar bill might get us through two months But the shock will hurt the economy long term 
PoliticalDiscussion,The court didn t overturn that decision in  It did establish that the commerce clause can t be used to justify literally anything Congress wants though by establishing that something else didn t fall under it
PoliticalDiscussion,It s an interesting point but seriously doubt Tulsi is gonna be the running mate She s made herself a personal non grata within the party even if she did endorse Biden in the end She seems like more of a contrarian than a true progressive And she s not gonna get people fired up like Sanders or even Warren 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely NOT
PoliticalDiscussion,Some experts say these stay at home orders aren t even constitutional so I would say yes
PoliticalDiscussion,but    but    SOCIALISM   
PoliticalDiscussion,No  State constitutions generally don t mention the federal government and the federal Constitution only mentions states not counties and cities  If you re thinking about what s been happening in Mississippi depends whether the Mississippi state constitution gives the governor the authority to overrule local authorities  POTUS can t overrule stay at home orders in New York California or Washington OTOH the federal government can issue nonbinding  guidance which governors and local authorities can use to justify loosening up restrictions however the decision would still be local  Trump is doing just enough to give the credulous reason to believe he s in control while leaving the difficult decisions to governors and local authorities 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s my mistake than on Rashida Like them both though
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope
PoliticalDiscussion,Is it me or is  X and  bucks and get you a cup of coffee an increasingly popular meme among political types Kind of like the word  nothingburger circa    I saw that phrase used in a couple of recent editorials 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d pay a lot of money to be a fly on the wall of potential employees reviewing interviewing Bernie s campaign surrogates for a serious job after the campaign ends  Not every employer is a bunch of juveline assholes employing each other because they are flushed in cash after collecting from lot of poor college kids Usually you would say they will learn their lesson on time but alas I haven t seen their capability to learn anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,For some reason I believed Jayapal was born to American parents overseas disregard her But not Tlaib she was born in Detroit 
PoliticalDiscussion,They are both immigrants
PoliticalDiscussion,As the other user pointed out   I meant Arizona sorry 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not condoning it I m saying it is possible he will attempt to force states to follow his orders to  reopen  
PoliticalDiscussion, It s okay if thousands and thousands die because Trump needs Wallstreet  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt One possible outcome after this virus blows over like every other one in history has done  Sure just like the Spanish Flu blew over right 
PoliticalDiscussion,That and most of the left votes too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden may have dementia Biden maybe senile but Biden isn t Trump therefore he has my vote  I m not gonig waste my time writing in Bernie for the general I m voting FOR WHOEVER THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IS I DO NOT CARE IF ITS A CAT BERNIE OR BIDEN
PoliticalDiscussion,How does it work then
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it s out of the question because NY is the affected area and Trump needs Wall St running 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden could flip a majority of the Rust Belt People really hated Hillary Biden really ran up the margins so far in the primaries Hillary lost the   Michigan primary in a close race Biden won every county I think and got more votes than Hillary Even Virginia had increased turnout He will outperform Hillary as they were tight margins and people just hated her Biden to many people represents a return to normalcy and calmness I would say he will flip Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania and Arizona  Wisconsin and North Carolina I am still up in the air about This seems like Joe Biden s year a candidate who was on the margins until South Carolina Got his momentum going then shot out like a cannon Overall he seems like the perfect candidate to run after four years of Trump He built a wide coalition and represents a return to normalcy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because if the president said it it must be right 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean it wouldn t be the first time 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s very nerve wracking to imagine things coming to this But it would be pretty satisfying to see someone finally stand up to Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you are following the wrong path here  The important point was the Federal Courts not allowing for that particular  quarantine while they had allowed other quarantines which were similarly racially targeted  That is the Federal Government had right to review and override 
PoliticalDiscussion,The end of slavery 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a coworker who voted for her  because she s the most focused on foreign policy  I ll admit I haven t looked into her at all so I don t know what her foreign policy  is  but he has a lot of family in the Middle East so it was a single issue vote for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has dementia biden is senile It would be like still having trump vote for Bernie even if he is a write in candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tulsi could have just stayed in the race and let her immune system clinch her the nomination tbh 
PoliticalDiscussion,republicans believe in state s rights so that would go against the very soul of his party  so  sure   
PoliticalDiscussion,Gavin Newsom and the mayors of the Bay Area counties where I live have been killing it so far We locked down first and have been seeing very high social compliance I m hopeful that the area dodges the worst of the crisis and can serve as an example to the rest of the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re assuming that Trump is a  good actor when it comes to any rights of states local governments or individuals There is a two way street going between his allies and himself with states like Florida and Mississippi not going under the quarantine of the other states and if it were up to Trump would force states to be open for business due to his own political survival This is not Trump respecting states rights It s that he has zero control over them and if he tried to bypass the rights of individual states the political fallout would end any chance of reelection   He has zero respect of the state itself Yet if he did have control over the states you know as well as I do he would apply pressure on them He is immoral How is anyone as immoral as Trump respect the will of anything other than his own    gt However a midwest farmer is going to have far different wants needs compared to a SF tech guru or a South American corporate cokehead in Miami at the end of the day state governments are far more effective at representing the individual s wants needs vs the federal government  Well sure but there are farms in California as well as render farms in the Midwest Your South American cokehead in Miami had the same needs as Wall Street cokehead in the early  s through the  s Wall Street did a buttload of coke back in the day probably the same today I agree on state governments representing needs better than federal and I will add your local city council has more impact on your quality of life than the state Yet guess who is in charge of the federal right now The immoral asshat who won t give any federal assistance to the states because  of politics  How is that respecting their rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because they re not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you re right that the suburbs are Joe s path forward but I think you re misreading  as anything other than the House getting what it deserved for banging the  repeal and replace drum for six years and then folding like a cheap tent when they were handed all three branches 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right of course It has no legal bearing on the OP s question but it DOES show the desire for politicians to overrule local politicians and mandate a less strict quarantine 
PoliticalDiscussion,A younger Hispanic woman with a business background and executive experience would be a great running mate Does this person exist in the party right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie Sanders is a possible name Yes Biden says he will pick a woman but he likely just spit that out under pressure and he is Biden he forgets a lot of things Biden needs to win over the  or so of Dems who voted for Sanders Only Bernie himself can really do that Liz Warren has lost her touch and AOC is too young If he picks Sanders he is almost guaranteed the election Only big issue is Sanders age and that Sanders might prefer to stay in the Senate There was a video of Trump being afraid of Hillary picking Sanders for VP due to Bernie s trade stances 
PoliticalDiscussion,Incase your wondering why its due to the house reps being tied to a specific number followed by the neccessity of dealing with fractions  because populations arent controlled by the state its why census data is critical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does anyone on the planet believe Donald J Trump could write that sentence 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government issuing orders and telling businesses what to do I cannot even imagine the brain twisting way that right wingers will believe that s okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,States do license businesses though right 
PoliticalDiscussion,In which city New York is very definitely staying at home The streets are ghostly empty 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the federal government under the th amendment has a role in protecting the civil rights of its citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to every book written from inside the White House what his staff generally does is just ignore him and count on him forgetting by the next day or getting distracted by something else    It seems to work like  of the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Voting Rights Act 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt S helter in place orders are a police power prerogative reserved to the States by the th Amendment  Whether this is a police power reserved by the states is far from clear The right to travel is constitutionally protected It could be argued that these blanket travel bans are over inclusive and violate strict scrutiny 
PoliticalDiscussion,No 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where did I say  liberal media anywhere in my post My point is that liberals and progressives have a large presence in the media just as much as the republicans do Is that a controversial viewpoint 
PoliticalDiscussion,That had to do with enforcing federal law though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly stay for at least a month in February If you cannot do it it is not for you 
PoliticalDiscussion,The blunt answer is no Part of the confusion is in past outbreaks the President was the one that called for particular shutdowns and coordinated efforts So if states were to close it was because the President asked them to and they were already willing to take the President s lead  In this case Trump basically said  I don t give a fuck this doesn t affect me  So now each state is making its own decisions without the President s input Human nature suggests they will continue to not value the President s input when he comes around demanding they open their states because now it affects his wallet which he cares about  Short of Congress passing something Trump could sign he has no say because he wasn t leading this in the first place and has repeatedly talked about it being  so hard to explain why he hasn t gotten test kits and PPE together Just what you want from a leader  it s hard so I won t do it    
PoliticalDiscussion,The interstate commerce and travel clause has been a driving force thanks to the Supreme Court in the erosion of state rights and the increase of federal power for centuries 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I really don t want to get into a political discussion  You realize you are literally in r PoliticalDiscussion right 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean yeah rather have smart policy in response to the disease in terms of public health and get less federal supplies than open everything at Trump s order and also get no federal supplies Trump doesn t give anything to blue states where this is really an issue anyhow I don t think they re concerned about him too much but   ask cuomo not me  In my opinion I wouldn t classify having the ability to illegally take action against states who disobey his suicidal advice as authority A murderer who breaks the law to murder and doesn t get convicted didn t have the authority to murder  just the tendency and ability There is a difference But functionally I m not sure it matters when it comes to government and the relatively absolute power we have enabled our presidents to progressively grab over the span of hundreds of years 
PoliticalDiscussion,My guess is Harris Tammy duckworth or Amy
PoliticalDiscussion,Elizabeth Warren She would act like an Obama like technocrat that would aide Biden in these new times 
PoliticalDiscussion,States will tell the Fed to go fuck them self s before anything  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Kyrsten Sinema would be amazing as a VP  Absolutely not I could not imagine a  worse pick All you have to do to make even a moderate democrat upset at her is tell them she supported William Barr s confirmation as Attorney General 
PoliticalDiscussion,  Laughs in Cajun 
PoliticalDiscussion,But trump can withhold money and resources if they dont comply Or steal their national gaurds away  Sure the courts might later find it illegal  Or they might not  But that takes time Do the states want to be without whatever trumps holding until then 
PoliticalDiscussion,Listen to the health experts Trump is not a expert 
PoliticalDiscussion,Omg it s what the slang term I said nothing about Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sadly you re probably right but there are likely to be a lot more motivated voters who usually sit out if they have family dying or their job lost because of Trump s slow action on these two problems 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even if you think it s unnecessary it doesn t make sense to associate the programme with Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,The president can not overrule Governors on  quarantine     Marshal law throw out the constitution that would only work for more tightening not less  Can t really have the military in the streets forcing  you need to come out on the street and go to  bars and movies 
PoliticalDiscussion,It really should be a more progressive VP pick It s the least he can do as an outreach to the young progressive voter bloc And I don t really want to hear  well those voters don t matter  because a handful of people still blame that group for costing the Dems in  You re not going to flip Trump voters with your VP pick but you can boost turnout with some people who may stay home otherwise  Rashida Tlaib would hit all the checkmarks people would want a woman of color from the Midwest but doesn t have the experience yet I think someone like Pramila Jayapal would be a very good messenger Both of those are probably unlikely though  I will vote Biden in the general but I really really am crossing my fingers that they do not pick Kamala Harris and try to sell it as an outreach to progressives because it would not work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Red states are run by people who have to pander to their base A base that is uneducated suspicious of  smart people and pigheaded enough to vote against their own self interest election after election  Draconian measures never work with idiots so red state governors don t even try  Funny thing about the virus though   it doesn t give a SHIT who you voted for Or what god you pray to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope I have no clue cuz I was never poor or homeless    You obviously don t live in a poor community like I do Giving people things they do not need enables them to do stupid shit Especially when the phone company sits outside the welfare office giving out phones We give enough free shit out I was a poor single mom at  it didn t take free shit to get me off the streets or out of a shelter It took free educational classes and help with day care This was under Bill Clinton s administration I didn t get welfare unless I went into a work program and learned a skill People survived before cellphones were around Do some people need it absolutely but don t give it out because you qualify for some help The welfare system is the biggest joke half the kids in the projects wear better clothes then me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure I agree The Strassers were shitty human beings despite being an ardent socialists because they had no problem with exterminating the jews for their vision and someone like Pelosi is a shitty human being despite being relatively in tune with identity issues because she s a corporate shill who would sell her constituency over for a piece of that sweet sweet corporate pie   The Biden thing is a perfect example of how identity politics can go wrong  saying he s going to have a woman as a running mate is such a pointless thing to say McCain did that a decade ago and no one who knows anything would say he was pro women 
PoliticalDiscussion,Last time  mil voted trump got  This year  mil voted Does that mean people were not voting for him or that people just did not vote  Probably the latter Look the guy s popularity has not sagged into the single digits like any sane person would think  his base  those left alive after believing trump about COVID anyway will come out in droves and vote for him because he hates the same way they do He will get  million votes in November Joe Biden needs  or  million to beat him 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This will die in the house and the Dems bill will die in the Senate without a vote Nothing will be done and we ll go into the crisis without any action until it s too late  Unlikely A bill will pass cause the alternative is disastrous for everyone That was why the bill passed  in the senate even with unanimous agreement from democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,It means he gets another reason to tweet out bullshit when it s Easter Sunday and half the states are still on isolation orders 
PoliticalDiscussion,I thought you already saw them     I mean who would just lie on the internet 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope Trump could rape his daughter in the oval office on live tv and his followers would still vote for him He could line up  of his supporters and shoot them on th avenue and the st would still vote for him  Meanwhile Biden could have Jesus H Christ as a running mate offering eternal salvation for votes an they still would not vote for Joe   Why I just typed it  trump hates brown people That is enough for most in this country 
PoliticalDiscussion,The GOP and evangelicals say they care about alot of things but it always seems like in the end of the day it all comes down to politics and greed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only carrots and sticks Do X to get Y funding or stop X or lose Y finding The most common examples are speed limits and seat belt laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am sorry but you clearly do not understand the mindset of the typical trump voter These people would literally rather DIE than have to take  obamacare and do not care if their water is poisoned and they are out of work forever as long as trump is doing  god s work   This is a system that has been rammed up their asses for over  years It is very very effective  Plus trump hates brown people they hate brown people   who else would they vote for 
PoliticalDiscussion,What exactly is her demographic I am genuinely confused about the  who still support her 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know about that After the stuff that happened in the past few months she s a pretty controversial figure among progressives to say the least Picking someone who holds progressive ideas and isn t divisive would be ideal 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  Liberal Media gave trump  billion dollars worth of free ads in the form of  crazy coverage and  balanced reporting in the  campaign   of the media in America is owned by  companies FIVE of which are owned by conservatives  Please tell me more about the  Liberal Media 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine this  I have a friend who is both black and heavily involved in my state Democratic Party  He s legit said to me that if a clean legalization bill hit his desk he would  not sign it because it wouldn t include any racial reparation component  I think when we get to the point where these kinds of thinkers aren t just some fringe but are the decisionmakers in the party it s about time to give a little more credence to the people saying  fuck identity politics   I don t agree with the overall sentiment but at the same time there s some serious dysfunction causing that sentiment which isn t invalidated by the fact that the people voicing the concern are being reactionary twats about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,We will have triple the number of   deaths in three weeks Ten times that in ten weeks  times that in  months I will NOT give up my life for a better economy But you can bet your sweet ass I will RISK my life to vote in November 
PoliticalDiscussion,Regularly updated map and number of cases throughout the world   
PoliticalDiscussion,Would both be needed Because I can see McConnell doing it    
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that s terrible How dare he give poor people phones The drug addicts you worked with are definitely the only ones in the world and therefore every obamaphone was used for drugs and sold for drugs  It s an economic stimulus and emergency relief measure Its a better use of the money than giving it to rich corporations to give their board members bonuses It makes sure that poor people have a cell phone which is a modern necessity to get a job or get help or have any quality of life  You have no clue about the cost of that program or the stimulus and life impact especially relative to the other options for the money The phones were actually a good idea    In every other country it wasn t a problem but in America when you see a bunch of black folks running around with free phones doing questionable shit well that gets the rednecks riled up who care about the lives saved   or the hundreds of people who got jobs that otherwise wouldn t 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So you need to get the narrow margin of people who either didn t vote in  because they didn t like either choice or the centrists who probably just don t like Trump as a person  That would be me and most people around my area Didn t vote for Trump because I think he s legitimately mentally incompetent regardless of his politics Didn t vote for Clinton because she was way too liberal According to  FiveThirtyEight   more liberal than  of the Senate and  according to OnTheIssues   she fits in the category of  hard core liberal   Yeah I know Hard to believe given the leftwing Reddit echochamber where people think that anyone right of Bernie is an arch conservative Nazi But Hilary was  not a moderate The woman honestly was the walking stereotype of an elitist coastal liberal and that s why she got hammered through the rust belt  Biden is honestly pretty conservative and that reassures me Like you said liberals are already going to vote for him which leaves the centrists Even with his track record a lot of people don t like how he was forced to the left on many issues during the primary and that could turn them off If he really wants to shore up support of the center he would do well in picking someone who has moderate credentials Kyrsten Sinema would be amazing as a VP but unfortunately I don t think she ll be picked because she only just got elected and Arizona is a vulnerable seat Jeanne Shaeen could be a possibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hoping for Tammy Baldwin She s a progressive who s from the rust belt so she can appeal to the left while also helping Biden win back those midwest states  Amy Klobuchar sounds too right for me to be honest Biden s already painted himself as a moderate in the party so having another one wouldn t do much to balance the ticket 
PoliticalDiscussion,Almost tossed a shoe at the tv when the woman said that we have no problems because there is a surplus of ventilators in NY right now Yeah get back to us in two weeks bitch 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s at least  rates too high for that
PoliticalDiscussion,Her prosecutorial is more than  ain t pretty  She s an authoritarian who took pleasure in locking up non violent offenders 
PoliticalDiscussion,This argument will have more weight when you don t simultaneously blame the apathy of Sanders supporters for costing the Dems the  election 
PoliticalDiscussion,So shocked that people are still able to type when their heads are so deeply buried in the sand 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt To the left Honestly no one Even if Bernie miraculous comes out as transgender tomorrow and Biden puts her on the ticket it would do nothing The progressives who would vote for Biden are voting for him to stop Trump and the VP doesn t matter to them and the progressives who won t vote for Biden won t support him for the variety of well established reasons anyways they d just say Bernie sold out instead  I think this is an excellent summary 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt feel so completely shat upon by the DNC that they won t unless some motion is made to indicate that they re anything more than the  Gail the Snail of the DNC  The obsessive focus on the DNC by Sanders supporters is part of why their campaign failed miserably At some point they need to make the connection that the DNC is mostly made up of  elected representatives   They won their respective elections for a reason To universally vilify the organization and everyone in it in order to throw red meat to your hardcore base is an awful campaign strategy It instantly alienated those voters who like their representatives   Until progressives start winning elections and finding a way to appeal to  voters who  elect reps that make up the DNC they will continue to fail   AOC seems to have learned the lesson She has been reaching out in a positive way to build coalitions and win her peers over Bernie has not 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Jeanne Shaneen  Her vote to confirm Gina Haspel will be a huge liability and she s from a state with a Republican governor Hard pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders and Jayapal have the College for All Act  Biden will not support it and has only agreed to adopt part of that  If anything what his accouncement amounts to is a promise to put forth a watered down version of the bill Sanders and Jayapal are already sponsoring which would have the effect of drowning the version that includes eliminating student debt 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it is an incorrect viewpoint when the work they do benefits a would be hitler s rise to power  You can say every spoke on a wheel is  liberal but if the car does nothing but crush the poor and oppressed they are not doing very  liberal work are they  In the  Hillary gave a very important speech outlining her foriegn policy position about Russia During that speech MSNBC NBC CNN AND ABC all showed a picture of an empty podium where trump was supposed to be speaking at that same time but he was too busy sniffing aderal in the back somewhere to bother with being on time  Then after he finally came out and have a disjointed rambling ralley the  progressive journalist media members  talked about THAT for the rest of the day Trump got  hours for an idiotic campaign speech when Hillary got  nothing for telling us how she would deal with putin  you know the ENEMY  If the so called progressives were REALLY progeessive they would have quit en mass in the middle of the  election  These same so called progressives do not challenge trump on any idiotic thing he ever says That press rokm should be EMPTY of progressives  they all should have had their passes revoked a long time ago  Liberal media my ass 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks I did review the rules but I must have missed that one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gotta say I m not voting for Joe if it is Harris as the vp  I just can t get past her being such a evil prosecutor She knew people were innocent and refused to show the evidence It s shows complete and total disregard for human life and justice 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey let s be nice to each other
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But it s too late now Biden would rather try too court the  we vote for women vote than to court the poor or far left vote  Biden adopted part of Warren and Bernie s platform If it s about the issues why wouldn t they be happy about that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hard to believe given the leftwing Reddit echochamber where people think that anyone right of Bernie is an arch conservative Nazi   Pew s data affirmed that people viewed Hillary as  liberal and Donald Trump as  moderate during the  campaign   It s crazy how the Bernie echo chamber creates a perception otherwise at least in their communities 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Federal always trumps state level   It doesn t though Because of the th amendment  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people   If the law is held to be a violation of the th amendment then the federal government can t enforce it 
PoliticalDiscussion,but that is a federal agency and they run the airports that is why I am not sure if the states could close them down 
PoliticalDiscussion,You still have to play taxes on  dirty money 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bloomberg would have been a hard vote but I would have ultimately pushed the lever But when my friends criticized my  Vote Blue No Matter Who stance I always said there was an implicit asterisk I could have easily voted for any of the names who were front runners or won important early contests and that s all that really mattered I could say  Vote Blue No Matter Who because I knew that Tulsi Gabbard wouldn t be successful and I wouldn t be made a hypocrite 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Kyrsten Sinema would be amazing as a VP  Biden s VP would be extra scrutinized I m not sure Sinema as a first term senator would weather that well  Honestly I think on paper at least someone like Gretchen Whitmer would be the best But it ll probably be Kamala Harris 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt a republican and a cop  Considering the midwest turned out in droves for Biden perhaps people using these monikers are not as dialled in on politics as they think 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also the final version of the stimulus bill now has language that forbids companies that are not incorporated in the U S or largely employ Americans are not eligible for stimulus meaning the cruise lines are now out They were definitely going to get a bailout until people started complaining so small victories can happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,I suspect this is what Trump wants He opens the country up Govenors say no people don t die because they stay home economy is a disaster but Trump can point at the Govenors and say  That s their fault  
PoliticalDiscussion,Obviously Barr is terrible but voting for a cabinet pick isn t the same as voting for legislation ultimately everyone votes for a cabinet pick they don t like one bit at one point or another
PoliticalDiscussion,Glass houses mate Trump is not well just listen to him speaking  years ago versus now 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,    Supreme Court ruled back in the New Deal that even performing actions that produced goods and services for your own consumption  thereby removing yourself and the demand you should have produced for interstate commerce  is regulatable under Congress s powers  In a scenario where an entire state tried to remove the demand supply it s population should be producing it wouldn t be a large stretch to base a law under Wickard v Filburn to force a state to comply 
PoliticalDiscussion,So a big challenge you could argue was that in  Tim Kaine was a poor choice  So I think you re going to see someone who is progressive but also a force in Congress which is Tammy Baldwin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Drugs speed limits alcohol age 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t need to swing votes the number of Obama votere who stayed home in  is enough to win well over   EVs
PoliticalDiscussion,Great a republican and a cop just what ticket the doctor ordered to win back the midwest
PoliticalDiscussion,That s easy Their main allegiance is not to an ideology but to Trump himself If he does it they ll say it s in America s best interest It doesn t really matter what he does they ll fall in line 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like fucking Twitter memes are doing better at attacking the republican policies then any of the democrats are But I m also a moron so my opinion is irrelevant
PoliticalDiscussion, gt he likely just spit that out under pressure and he is Biden he forgets a lot of things   No way That was pre planned Plus he s always hinted he would pick a woman anyway And plus it would look bad to go back on it    gt If he picks Sanders he is almost guaranteed the election   I think you re over rating his appeal
PoliticalDiscussion,Barr has a somewhat unique history and hes been a complete stooge anyway
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it s possible lol His approval has had a range though We ll certainly see what happens and a good  of voters will be unhappy either way
PoliticalDiscussion,There was also Bloomberg He was the only person who made me question that mentality since he was pretty much like Trump in so many ways 
PoliticalDiscussion,No but he can threaten to cut off funds to the states that piss him off 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Biden has made more concessions to the left than people realize and I think there s diminishing returns there at this point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh okay I guess that makes sense One thing that was consistent about her was her foreign policy of ending wars It was to her like Medicare for all was to Bernie Sanders 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know this is a joke but for the record it wouldn t work even if the top  choices were incapacitated Their delegates would simply choose someone else
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has made a ton of concessions to the left already hasn t he Weed seems like a particular one reddit is stuck on But he changed his tune on the Hyde amendment adopted a Bernie plan and adopted a Warren plan He s also generally moved left on a lot of things compared to the Obama administration 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ehhhh When it comes to cabinet picks we should give leeway Who s to say his replacement wouldn t have been an even bigger stooge 
PoliticalDiscussion,The U S was late to ramp up testing only starting at the beginning of March which means we don t yet have complete information on who is infected or the rate at which the virus is spreading You can t make your claim with such insufficient data 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s probably not a ton of data either way so it s hard to make claims like you did though
PoliticalDiscussion,This is why states have their own disaster preparation measures and also why it is a problem If the federal government doesn t act responsibly and move resources across states to where they are needed each state will have to fend for itself If aid comes from other countries it is constitutionally mandated that it is negotiated at the federal level All in all it really isolates the states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump can say whatever he wants but with the division of powers inherent in the federalist system his powers to  overrule are significantly limited It really comes down to what your definition of  overrule would be Directly speaking he can t lift orders on the state level These are at the discretion of the state level government with the court system in place to make sure they remain legal Indirectly the president could use executive orders to change federal policy in a way that discourages states from keeping quarantines in place   In short no but in reality he could  make an offer they can t refuse should he really want to  convince governors to lift the orders 
PoliticalDiscussion,The commenter is definitely using inflammatory language but a lot of his actions show extreme distaste for Muslims He ll frequently retweet breitbart which has called Muslims  rapefugees and how terrorism is a distinct part of Muslim culture Look at this photo   You re really going to tell me that trump is a fan of Muslims    In  trump was sued for housing discrimination against black people I ll admit he wasn t convicted and he did settle the matter himself He continued to insist that the Central Park  were guilty and deserved the death penalty long after they were found to be innocent Sheriff joe Arpaio was found by the DOJ to have lead one of the worst racial profiling events in memory Stopping Latino drivers x x more than anyone else throwing Latinos in solitary confinement for not understanding English and way way more Trump pardoned him calling him a  great patriot  basically endorsing his actions   Hell trump was fully convinced of the birther theory You think he would have been as skeptical if Obama was a white guy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m convinced he goes to these discussions with his Cabinet and hears a bunch of things that sound interesting and he wants to act knowledgeable and smart about the situation so starts spouting off random quotes he remembered  He gets angry if called out on it by the press since he doesn t actually know what he is saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kind of He can threaten to withhold grants and federal money If a state decides to completely ignore federal laws there s no real way to force them to comply You can t invade them or something but one of the most effective ways is by withholding highway repair funds Highways deteriorate fast and it won t be long before the people in a state get really fed up and put pressure on their own state  Now that I type this this is a unique situation because not many people are driving due to shelter in place
PoliticalDiscussion,Something something Al Capone 
PoliticalDiscussion,The same party that compares democratic socialists on the same level as Venezuela but raced to Capitol Hill last week to start cutting checks to every citizen and even immigrants without hesitation and bail out non state enterprises  It s a party of hypocrites nothing more 
PoliticalDiscussion,Regulating commence doesn t mean they get to demand states do business just that they get to set some rules on how they do it if the states so choose 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d like to ask balance the ticket from what to what I need to know what it is in the first place to get the right  weight for the the balance 
PoliticalDiscussion,The logic of King v Burwell s Medicaid expansion ruling makes that unlikely though Congress can no longer offer large amounts of money to states and then turn around and add new  onerous requirements on the funds 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey you leave our corporate cokeheads out of this    
PoliticalDiscussion,Yet still have to pay federal tax
PoliticalDiscussion,I m in NYS and I approve of how Cuomo is handling and as a NYC resident for over  years I approve of De Blasio s handling of it as well  Having said that I am doing my best to not let the panic or anxiety rage as I know we as a state city or country can t sustain this for very long Eventually my employer won t be able to pay me and unemployment even with the extra money in the NYC metro area barely covers rent or mortgage So I m with Trump  can t believe is just said that on the idea that we gotta figure this out fast and get to work  but obviously I mean that in a sensible way  not his psycho way  
PoliticalDiscussion,So a bit too good to join Trump s team then 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this just happened in one of the southern states  Some state just blocked flights from arriving from other states didn t it   I am not in this country so I m just watching from waaaaaay out here  
PoliticalDiscussion,When I said   levels I meant support for the President FYI 
PoliticalDiscussion,Amazing that the figurehead of the party that has rallied behind  States Rights since forever and which is using that platform to bullshit their way through all of this and provide no funding to public governments agencies is now in the position of lording their federal might in order to preserve their precious stock values 
PoliticalDiscussion,That saying has been around for about  years used to be a quarter but has been adjusted for inflation Opinions are like assholes everyone has one is another oldie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope
PoliticalDiscussion,To expand on this I think Biden is likely to endorse Sherron Brown for some excellent reasons    Senator Sherrod Brown  decade long senator from Ohio rd most liberal person in the US senate amazing speaker is the ideal compromise candidate that the whole party can unify behind He is as liberal as Bernie but without the Socialist label Brown is insanely popular in the midwest and won Ohio by double digits every single election and those are the states Bernie lost  Ohio will singlehandedly guarentee that Brown gets elected president Brown s amazing speaking skills and authenticity is why a Senator who consistently ranks among the most liberal in the Senate manages to repeatedly win Ohio in landslide victories      Brown is also good friends with Biden and only chose not to run because Biden asked him not to If Biden drops out and endorses Brown and asks his delegates to vote for Brown instead that would be ideal 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not about ideology it s about turnout For every protest abstention there s atleast  apathetic voters Picking someone from X state or who appeals to Y demographic can shift turnout on the margins and the election will probably be very close electorally 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re still committing a federal crime they just better things to do with their time Marijuana shops can t even use banks because the money is considering a legal grey area they have to use cash 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Article IV m section  of the US Constitution   gt This Constitution and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof and all Treaties made or which shall be made under the Authority of the United States shall be the supreme Law of the Land and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding  So yes all federal law overides any conflicting state laws or even state constitutions Examples might include when they raised  the drinking age by holding federal highway money as hostage although that s a little indirect The Civil Rights Act of  made it illegal  in theory to discriminate based on race in state courts In Arizona v US the Supreme Court held that parts of Arizona law  Senate Bill  were preempted by federal immigration law and therefore invalid under the supremacy clause  Anyway your right that the federal government can t force state agencies to directly enforce federal laws  that s what federal agencies are for  but the feds are completely immune to any state laws and state laws that are ruled to be in conflict with federal laws are null and void  although states can sue the federal government if they think the feds broke federal law  
PoliticalDiscussion,Newsom getting banks to suspend mortgage payments is baller I love our governor 
PoliticalDiscussion,Similar to the primaries  peaking too soon might actually be a bad thing If this is the highest it becomes time might make people settle in to the punctual choices that Trump has made over the next few months If this pandemic hit in November I could see this being a driving factor to winning him re election but as months go by and the inadequacies of Trump s choices become more obvious this could easily become his hurricane Katrina  To use an example Trump is trying to push for a re opening on Easter yet every expert and state governor is against the idea If he tries re opening quarantine when we re not ready or decides its impossible to re open quarantine by Easter he s already shot himself in the foot by making such an impossible promise This is more likely to be a common occurrence over the next few months and I can see his public perception dwindle as these impacts continue  To be fair no administration would have been prepared for this but as what other s have said on this thread its still too early to know for certain what the electoral impact of this will be 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tlaib is way way too controversial of a representative to ever be a nominee for VP 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there any evidence to suggest they  would in any greater numbers than any other groups 
PoliticalDiscussion,In Texas I think the response has been adequate Most business are closed until April rd and no public gatherings of more than   That date could change if things get worse here though But so far it seems to be under control   Beyond closures and funding hospitals I don t think that there s much more the states can do Everyone should be responsible by limiting how often they go out and staying home of sick 
PoliticalDiscussion,It means that each state will be reaponsible for determining how much of a quarentine to implement 
PoliticalDiscussion,Since when has New Mexico been a solid red state The only time it s voted for a republican in the last several decades was when Bush won it by less than  in  Right now the governor all senators and all members of the house are Democrats I really have to shake my head anytime someone called New Mexico a red state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hell the state could pay  employ people to stay home Checkmate feds 
PoliticalDiscussion,He does not have the power to prevent them from issuing and maintaining such orders However as the leader of the Republican party if he were to signal such a policy shift many Republican governors would likely look for ways to follow suit The country would turn into a hodgepodge of policies with some states resembling a military grade quarantine others allowing people to travel and socialize but keeping large gatherings cancelled and others opening schools businesses and manufacturing sites to full capacity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sinema would be useful to flip the plausible purple red states but Biden is already at his strongest there He needs someone who could patch the progressive cred 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there any evidence that potheads wouldn t stay home on election day anyways 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why would they  Are you kidding You think a large percentage of his supporters would take the information from the  Fake News over Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they were smart they would vote for a man with dementia that doesn t even know where he is instead 
PoliticalDiscussion,The democrats hate Trump so much that they are blocking relief efforts The media hates Trump so much that they are trying to silence him and are spreading misinformation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you have any proof that Trump hates brown people No proof No facts just proves that you really are deranged 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump re election is almost unopposed Biden has dementia Trump is going to slaughter him in the debate  People approve of Trump s leadership and they will re elect him 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Republicans aren t a party of anything at this point They have no ideology and no value set It is nakedly about nothing but money and power now they aren t even pretending  I m not sure why people continue to pretend the Republicans have real values that they ve just been taking a vacation from for  years  The Republican party needs to die and the Democrat party needs to split The Democrat tent is too large and some of the more conservative Dems at this point are identical to what Republicans were until around  or so when the Southern Strategy had been fully fleshed out  Really to represent America correctly there should probably be   An explicitly religious values party that basically pushes for Christian Theocracy  A realpolitik business oriented party that would be a blend of neo cons and neo liberals  A progressive party that would be advocating for socialist policies  An anti government party that advocates for the reduction of government outside of all ideology goals problems etc  The Republican party doesn t represent any of these right now Not even the religious party Oh sometimes they pay lip service to it and they certainly enact laws that persecute people Christians don t agree with but Christianity is also about charity and community and helping support each other  A lot of Christians I know are uncomfortable with how our society and government treat the vulnerable in this country and seem to feel dirtied by it  The Republicans represent nothing The Democrats represent too many things 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump already has the election in the bag either way Biden has dementia and is medically unfit to lead anything anymore Trump is going to slaughter him in the debates 
PoliticalDiscussion,Australia s interstate commerce clause has a specific health exemption  I don t know about the USA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has already torpedoed the weed vote because he s already pledged not to legalize marijuana 
PoliticalDiscussion,Me either but Trump sure is hinting that he s going to try 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s wild to me is that Biden does have a public option listed on Joebiden com and Republicans are convinced that a public option becomes a back door to single payer so it s just shit from both sides I like a public option regardless it s a useful bridge to a better system but also could fix a lot of my peers problems right now too 
PoliticalDiscussion,States collect state income tax that s why it s a separate filing from Fed 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yeah the media is trying really hard to find reasons to blame him But like I said most people would have thought he was a dictator in January if he had shut the economy down He responded way earlier than Obama by the way and he never said he was planning on reopening the economy by Easter but he was hoping to Which he should The job of the president is to instill hope   gt  Maybe even Trump doesn t understand how bogglingly slavish a certain set of his supporters are but I think this horse is out of the barn already Regardless of conditions on the ground we ll probably find out people  packed the pews to pwn the libs on Easter and some of those people will die as a result Maybe Trump doesn t realize the evangelicals are like that maybe he does But there s a difference between instilling hope and false promises and I think setting a calendar date crossed that line
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the more likely option is that Trump pressures Republican governors that don t do what he wants with a primary challenge withdrawal of support  That won t play in purple states but he d likely get his way in deep red states 
PoliticalDiscussion,All I m saying is he gave zero shits about the concerns and beliefs of conservatives   Why should the republicans care about the people on the left now that they have power Remember we are all just a bunch of ignorant rednecks in fly over states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I m glad you can at least realize restricting access to China was smart and not cry racism like the masses of the left did and are still trying to do And I agree his response has been lack luster in general  But it doesn t really matter nobody really cares about the lives or helping anyone Trump just wants to stay up in polls and democrats just want to hurt him in the polls Neither honestly care about the sick and dying imo If they did they wouldn t be trying to shove diversity quotas into a bill about helping those who can t pay their bills   So what does it matter if nobody really cares   And sorry I didn t respond to the previous comment a lot of people come at me whenever I post anything  because I won t worship the left blindly so I get quite a few responses and sometimes I fail to respond 
PoliticalDiscussion,In  Democrats lost a special election for senate in Massachusetts In  Republicans lost a special election for senate in Alabama If Biden wins and there s a special election there in  Minnesota is not safe blue not even close 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll give you the super pacs but you still framed it as  so she could stay in the race which reads as she should have just gotten out of Sanders way
PoliticalDiscussion,Read up couple posts up already responded to this  And no actually More people agree with you than me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt and the Republican Party s grip on the media immovable   People actually believe this  Aside from Fox News every single other major media entity is slanted firmly in favor of the left 
PoliticalDiscussion,If he had responded properly  months ago we would not be in this situation requiring a nation wide lockdown Like I said before two days ago when you did not respond to my original comment I agreed it was a good idea to ban travel from China He failed to prepare otherwise and ignored advice from his team though leading to this situation
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you saying Obama did the same thing Obama s biggest mistake was he was too nice 
PoliticalDiscussion,He really hasnt been adopting strong left wing views from this campaign cycle just ones that were left wing views when he was in office The overton window has shifted hard and he s done the bare minimum to keep up  Changing to be against the hyde amendment was at the start of the campaign because he realized that he needed to be fully pro choice if he wanted to win any primary votes It wasn t an olive branch to the left it s a mainstream position in the Democratic party Literally no other candidates were for keeping the hyde amendment because it s electoral suicide to have pro life positions and run for the democratic nomination   I m assuming the Bernie plan youre referring to the free college for all those whose parents make under k That wasnt a Bernie plan It was a position that Bernie got Clinton to compromise to  adding to her platform Adopting Clinton s unity platform is definitely a step in the right direction but its far from taking Bernie s policy positions Bernie has been speaking for free college for all without means testing since   The Warren bankruptcy plan is a good one and it is something that he fought hard against when he was in office and its honestly the only new thing he s picked up that I can praise him for   At this point I m expecting Biden to pick up some of Warren s and more of Clinton s platform and little of Bernie s plans He s not a man to shift the Overton window to the left   I hope that I m wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes and then you will all cry about the economy being shit  Just like you all called him racist for restricting access to china  And on and on it will go 
PoliticalDiscussion,Jesse Jackson would probably resent that but yeah in the general you re right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Taking super PAC money doesn t have anything to do with Sanders but I don t want to argue this 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is why I have lost a lot of respect for scientist and the left  One day they call him racist for closing borders the next day they cry he didn t do enough   At some point the double talk pissed people off 
PoliticalDiscussion, You guys is broad btw I can only speak on my personal beliefs I definitely don t reflect all Democrats as I lean right with certain things And again I was bothered by the relentless bombing of the Middle East Most non idiots are as well To answer your Qs I ll fully acknowledge that there s implications of employing cheap labor the  go back to your own country point was directed of when he said that to US citizens I don t think  building a wall and  securing our borders are necessarily racist And honestly There s probably very valid arguments to be made for considering the wars in the Middle East to be racist They were overall unnecessary and resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocents Having previous presidents doing dumb shit doesn t excuse anyone to say or do dumb shit either I do think he s called on being a racist a bit too much and he definitely isn t a white supremacist but I believe his words and actions have and do enable others Which imo is still bad While not entirely his fault could be avoided if he said less dumb shit 
PoliticalDiscussion,There hasn t been a left leaning Democratic candidate since  Mondale was a moderate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Welcome to being a conservative hiring the Obama years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Literally all of those are just examples of times she didn t bow down to Sanders
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely Sanders is  beyond all criticism 
PoliticalDiscussion,What games Are you telling me it s impossible to criticize Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just trying to see if this poll is conducted by self identification or not because if it is then what it needs to read is  X percentage of Americans admit to having smoked cannabis not  X percentage of Americans smoked cannabis  
PoliticalDiscussion,The VP slot is absolutely pivotal this election because Joe is all but certain to be one term and many even wonder if he would last an entire four years Who ever is VP is the all but certain to expand the role even more than Cheney did with Bush 
PoliticalDiscussion,Socialism for the rich doesn t count You should know that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Staista is used by a lot of businesses they provide access API s for market research Their entire business model relies on the fact that their data is reliable They re not just making shit up don t be dense 
PoliticalDiscussion,The sexist scandal in January which resulted in her being called a snake her taking super PAC money later on to stay in the race while using her gender as an excuse the fact that the progressive movement probably would ve had a better chance had she dropped out before Super Tuesday while the moderates were consolidating The history of her disappointing progressives even goes back to  too where she chose not to run despite Bernie wanting her to and chose not to endorse him when he was against Clinton leading to a narrow loss in Massachusetts that she probably could ve changed Oddly enough the same thing happened in  where Bernie narrowly lost against Biden in the same state which must ve stung pretty bad for Sanders supporters who lived through  to today Just saying that it d probably be better to pick a progressive who doesn t have that sort of toxicity Toxicity was what caused Hillary to lose in  cause there were people even on the left who didn t want to vote for her if not against her 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it s you guys that seem to be bothered by words more than bombs  Also you guys sound small minded when you dismiss his anti immigration policies as racism Like you don t understand the economic implications of importing loads of cheap labor into the country  If anything allowing illegals to come in to be exploited without many rights is human trafficking How come you don t call that racism How come you don t call all the wars directed at Muslims racism  I guess I would have to look into that sheriff This is the first time I m hearing about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I m not going to play your games Walt 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you think Clinton is  way too liberal you need a reality check 
PoliticalDiscussion,A follow up to our previous conversation we now have three new clusters in Detroit Chicago and New Orleans We will likely continue to have new hotspots in the coming day with various levels of severity Fauci has publicly raised the idea of a National Shelter in Place already We need to have already declared one and if Trump doesnt soon this will continue to be on him
PoliticalDiscussion,The centrists who don t like Trump on a personal level still voted for him Trying to court the never Trump Republicans is a losing strategy Those people aren t going to vote for Biden even though he is a DINO 
PoliticalDiscussion,I seriously don t get this mentality You re railing against centrist Dems for their failures but can t cast a critical eye at Bernie or progressives at all   I can criticize anyone Go through my post history and you ll see me trashing Biden s campaign for various reasons   But it seems you d rather be right about Biden or Hillary losing than actually building a winning progressive movement   I mean Bernie folk revel in Hillary s  loss and say she it s her fault You re right  But when Bernie loses a primary it s everyone s fault but his   Come on dude If you actually care about progressive policies you ll start by criticizing Bernie He failed Period 
PoliticalDiscussion,Minnesota is safe blue Nevada leans blue Wisconsin is not a place you want a special election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Harris is a worse pick than Duckworth imo Duckworth might be neutral the left loathes Harris No one but NY DC white collar people who read WaPo   NYT op eds would be excited by a Harris pick It s idpol for the sake of idpol 
PoliticalDiscussion,So is your standard for racism an outright war I ll happily critique bush and Obama for many things especially the wars in the Middle East It s often forgotten how many innocent people were killed needlessly This also doesn t discount all of the other things I listed in my post Additionally  mean things can have a big impact when you re the leader of the US People look up to you So if you say  I m cool with sheriff joe the guy who was held in contempt of court and tortured Latinos do you not see how that kinda condones racism Or if he tells someone to  go back to their own country then doesn t That condone saying it to others 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right the Democratic base is turned off by the  tired strategy of Sanders and every other person in the country except for you centrist Dems are turned off by the  tired strategy of centrist Dems  But you can ignore the lessons of your previous losses again it won t surprise anyone as it s pretty much  you guys MO at this point to ignore any lessons you could learn from losses and blame anyone but yourselves  Your rationale led you to loss after loss yet you still bang the drum but you with no sense of irony denounce us for  tired strategy   Enjoy trying to win  with the strategy that failed in  and  
PoliticalDiscussion,Strasserism is an obscure Nazi aligned ideology that has had pretty much zero real world impact or relevance for over a century until some woke bloggers dug it up from Wikipedia and started using it as a smear label for the growing contigent of the  left but not particularily woke leftists   Between this and equating  I don t think having black trans CEOs drone pilots  insert meme hyperbole here is doing anything to solve the fundamental issues of capitalism to  I don t think poc and queer people should be allowed to live  it s a bit hard to take this post seriously 
PoliticalDiscussion,Legal question asked and answered 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly There s plenty to criticize from a moral and policy perspective 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hell trump was fully convinced of the birther theory You think he would have been as skeptical if Obama was a white guy  Yes in fact  he actually was that skeptical about a white guy in the same situation  
PoliticalDiscussion,Since when hasn t Trump done whatever the fuck he wants and gotten away with it As long as his party over country Republicans live up to their well deserved title the answer is obviously  yes  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I love how when our candidate loses two primaries it s evidence that we need to realign our politics  Who said anything about adjusting your politics You need to adjust your campaign strategy Bernie ran an awful campaign Period Full Stop   Policies are whatever   And progressives gyrate from calling Obama and Bill progressives to neo liberal sellouts Enough They both had winning  campaigns  Maybe focus on how they built coalitions instead of railing against the elites and establishment   Bernie s tired strategy alienated the Democratic Base  That is the lesson they need to take away from this campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump having dementia is a non issue for me because even if he s of completely sound mind the decisions he s making are fucking awful  He doesn t need to have a degenerative disease to be a shit stain of a human and a horrendous president He can and very likely does do that with a completely sound mind because he s a fuckwad piece of garbage from the top of his shitty coiff to the soles of his lifted shoes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honest question here what did Warren do wrong to upset progressives besides not being Bernie Sanders 
PoliticalDiscussion,I saw the graph but the source is paywalled 
PoliticalDiscussion,I love how when our candidate loses two primaries it s evidence that we need to realign our politics but when you centrists lose backing Kerry and Clinton but only win when Obama forces you to back a more progressive candidate it s totally a sign that another boring centrist will win in   Funny how you guys have all the advice in the world despite losing constantly 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like that picture really shows the contrast But what I don t understand about you guys is the fact that Trump isn t starting any wars with Muslims Bush and Obama had enough tact to say nice things in front of a camera but in reality the were killing Muslims in wars and drone strikes You guys seem to care more about appearances than what is actually happening Trump may have said mean things but he isn t out killing and imposing his will  Also the birther thing was just him trolling for press He even admitted it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s the  graph   in the article I m sure you could also find similar statistics in other sites 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden adopted part of Warren and Bernie s platform  That is my original statement    gt  Biden is totally adopting the progressive platform  This is your interpretation of my statement   Biden offered a compromise to progressives and your responsive is  Like I said pissing on our heads and expecting us to call it a favor   So the question becomes this how much of Bernie s platform  should he adopt  All of it  Because then he s shitting on the voters who voted for his own platform   Bernie lost It s time for progressives to realize he is a two time failed primary candidate   If progressives want to move their policies and vision forward they need to find a new way Don t be angry at Biden Be angry at the guy who had a mountain of money volunteers and infrastructure and squandered it away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also it s annoying as fuck to see people on reddit act like armchair psychologists over this issue You can find clips of literally anyone stuttering or making dumb mistakes Painting that as dementia is deeply disrespectful to not only the target but also anyone who has an elderly relative who is suffering from these problems  I m by no means a fan of Trump He s an inept populist who isn t deserving of his position But I will defend him from stupid fucking claims like dementia Joe Biden doesn t have dementia and neither does Trump Debate their policies all you want but the moment that someone stoops to that level they have lost their moral credibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Source is paywalled 
PoliticalDiscussion,But why I agree the economy has major systemic issues but an economic collapse will not solve that and will only injure America as well as the rest of the world 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah there are governors from both parties doing a great job in responding 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah sure
PoliticalDiscussion, I beg to differ    of adult users are between the ages of  and  while only  are above  The former are the least likely to vote and the latter the most 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would think if you biggest gripe with a bill was not included in the version passed you would find out if it made it into the final version before complaining online about it  But hey you do you and stay as informed as you want to 
PoliticalDiscussion,My democratic governor in R I is doing amazing I watch her briefing everyday along with the state DOH they have been awesome 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except that if the Democrats win more massive socialist bills will pass which will cause them to vote for Trump because the alternative is worse to them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Worst take I ve seen in this thread    gt Biden says he will pick a woman but  It would be terrible optics going back on his promise   gt  he is Biden he forgets a lot of things  The  Biden has dementia narrative that Bernie supporters are spreading is not only a bullshit conspiracy theory it s only helping Trump at this point   gt Biden needs to win over the  or so of Dems who voted for Sanders  Pandering to Bernie supporters is a futile effort They are either reasonable progressives who will vote for the Democratic nominee no matter what or true believers who would only vote for Biden if he pulled off a mask to reveal that he had been Bernie in disguise the entire time   gt If he picks Sanders he is almost guaranteed the election  Sanders has more skeletons in his closet than Jeffrey Dahmer  his consistent support for communist regimes the creepy sex essays he wrote in the s the fact that  socialism is still a dirty word for a majority of the country voted against the AMBER Alert system his support for massive tax hikes the fact that he s never had a steady job that wasn t paid for by taxpayer money the shady finances between his wife and Burlington College etc  and Republicans would unleash it all to drag Biden down   gt Only big issue is Sanders age  That is an ENORMOUS issue Nobody will want the top two leaders in the country to be in their late  one of which recently had a heart attack  In addition to all this if a Biden Sanders ticket managed to win Vermont s Republican Governor would appoint a Republican to fill Bernie s vacant Senate seat 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the panic over here on the east coast is a little higher due to population  our gov in R I mass has a press conference every day at  pm 
PoliticalDiscussion,Space force is about to move forward with leaps and bounds
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not a blatant lie Its a FACT that isn t valid anymore but at one point that s what was in the bill It s no longer that way but saying someone is lying just because they aren t caught up to the newest version is pretty petty 
PoliticalDiscussion,I  can only hope this completely destroys the American economy It was falsely propped up anyway By the fake tax cut for the middle class that was actually A Massive hand out to corporations and CEOs 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know I can only imagine how anyone lives with such high rents
PoliticalDiscussion,And then republicans had the audacity to complain that dems were holding up the bill bc they didn t want to hand mr Money bags a wad of unchecked cash so the party of  no free hand outs  Is actually claiming that their handouts aren t free enough and the dems are bad for blocking them  republicans truly have no back bone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pot use isn t concentrated among young people pot arrests are 
PoliticalDiscussion,Threaten to treat republican governors like he treats Romney if they maintain a lockdown Blame them for the economic situation   Democratic governors will be blamed by Trump regardless of the actions taken He s already trying to pin the pandemic on New York NYC  Democrats were unprepared to treat their people then did more damage by overreacting and shutting everything down The recession is completely the fault of Andrew Cuomo Nancy Pelosi Joe Biden and the Democrat Party  
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically if republican voters had backbones or any morals which they don t but if they did they would NOT vote for trump this November because he just allowed a massive socialist bill to pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think they were being harsh
PoliticalDiscussion,I d also like to say that many places are turning purple or blue not necessarily due to migration but simply because dem voters are turning up more now So truly most places have always been blue states because ppl are by nature democratic  there more helpers than selfish ppl on this planet but thanks to gerrymandering and other GOP spearheaded voting disenfranchisement some states appear To be red states turning blue When actually we are just starting to see closer to honest elections We know from an ample amount of research and data that republicans only win by getting fewer votes and gerrymandering the fuck out of a county 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Republicans represent the rich  It s just that there aren t enough rich people to vote them in so they take up whatever policy that will get them the votes to get them into office 
PoliticalDiscussion,My hope is that Mr Obama s Curttails will pick someone qualified by more than simply having a vagina 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like how quickly you shifted gears from  Biden is totally adopting the progressive platform to  Why should Biden adopt the progressive platform  
PoliticalDiscussion,Its an exercise of police power which is reserved to the states He hasn t read the Constitution so he doesn t know that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Younger people vote less 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody who wasn t already going to vote for Biden is going to vote for him because of his VP pick  Honestly just pick whoever would do best in the position and isn t gaff prone  Ofc it has to be a woman since he already said it would be but other than that it won t make a difference 
PoliticalDiscussion,Forget about the civil war 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Alcohol being raised to  wasn t because of a law but because they withheld federal highway for states that didn t raise  Only a small portion of highway funding  The ACA rulings make it clear that funding rules cannot be coercive 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m so confused why Dems have Tulsi The only policy disagreement I can see they have with her is she s anti war 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt     for Mnuchin to throw around as he pleases with the only oversight being Trump himself   Maybe go back a check out what passed  This is a blatant lie  Not to mention the BN is in the form of loans to be paid back  just like TARP was    
PoliticalDiscussion,No Dems lost because of overall apathy a hated candidate a terrible campaign and myriad of other reasons 
PoliticalDiscussion,How much of a losing platform should Biden adopt   I mean Bernie even said he  wouldn t court moderates if he won the nomination His words  The party will have to adjust to me   So Biden sucks for not giving up enough but Bernie is allowed to be an absolutist 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it is about optics though I agree with you to an extent but among progressive voters Biden is seen as very moderate Having a progressive pick with no baggage such as Baldwin or Duckworth would definitely be the best move 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden already out did her in the black community from the start is he really going to pick the women who insulated on live TV Biden was a racist  Harris burned that bridge 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was unanimous in the senate just like the title says   Massie is in the house not the senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,the mass graves will be filled the bodies will pile up the economy will crash and thousands or possibly millions will die  He ll still get re elected Mark my words
PoliticalDiscussion,So I want start by addressing your first claim  Elections are all about turnout   I m going to talk about my background a bit and while I know longer work in politics I was in a field office for a bit Most field campaigns can be designed in three phases in regards to voter outreach identifying persuasion and GOTV The majority of field campaigns is getting the undecided and unsure people that are likely to vote for you or likely to not nessecarily vote against you but vote consistently tend to be where you focus in terms of the persuasion field So while I agree with it is about turnout it is not blind straight down party turnout  So let s go to the question you asked If the argument is will Harris draw in the African American voting block I d argue that while no voting block is a monolith not really Biden has and continues to have a huge support from the African American population something Harris couldn t garner in the general   However the bigger draw that Baldwin provides is a securing of the Midwest If you want to look at  taking the midwest for granted was a big mistake this will help rope in the people who are on your persuasion universe 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Pissing on our heads and expecting us to call it a favor  As another Sanders supporter you re being silly As much as I hate to say it the voters preferred Biden s platform The fact that he s reaching out at all is a positive in my book And the idea that any progressive would declare this olive branch  not good enough because they feel offended is pretty silly too when the alternative is Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt   p s It basically is the job of a prosecutor to prosecute They don t write the law  Hmmmm I swear I ve heard this line of reasoning before   
PoliticalDiscussion,He s said he would reschedule it and leave the rest to the states which is more or less what the president can do 
PoliticalDiscussion,That makes no sense we ll have a Democratic VP no matter what If Warren is the VP then we re down an actual senator Her seat is not safe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden is already doing great with the black vote he needs to focus on getting the blue collar and Midwestern votes 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s actually the opposite The Vice President is the Senate Leader 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mondale had zero chance running against Reagan when his pitch was  Morning in America  when things were actually going really really well in America  quibble away but most Americans felt that way at the time    Mondale also said out loud that he was going to raise taxes on every American He ran against a charismatic President in a great economy picked a bad VP and ran a pretty bad campaign His personal politics had very very little to do with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sinema is truly interesting She won t be a VP pick but she is an absolutely canny politician She will be a senator for a long long time She knows how the game is PLAYED She s also gorgeous and has a flat out incredible and striking fashion sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,An economic collapse during the Trump presidency would be a nightmare scenario  The republicans would take that to the bank and destroy what little protection the American working class has left 
PoliticalDiscussion,So elections are about turnout   Here s a thought experiment I don t have the answers really just thinking Which of these groups have a larger portion of attainable voters that will or will not vote African Americans who would possibly vote in higher numbers if Harris was the VP nominee Or progressives if Tammy Baldwin was the nominee     xB  Are either group more likely to stay home at this point Do either group have a large amount of undecideds  African American males yes progressives no  What nominee can garner the largest portion of voters into the voting booth that would otherwise not be there Are progressives going to   not  vote against Trump knowing what the alternative is Will African Americans    xB  Think about it in those terms 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly the idea that not buying coffee and going out is an answer to people s economic problems is kind of a joke  It s like the whole Avacado toast thing  Even if we live like monks we still wouldn t be able to afford economic security 
PoliticalDiscussion,No you re just making shit up when it s convenient  If you want to poke holes in the UE rate there are other rates that account for those factors Otherwise you re just obfuscsting the issue as again this has been measured this way for longer than either of us have been alive  If you want to discuss how they affected the U unemployment rate or any other rate I ll need to do some research to determine what the actual facts are But as it stands your quarrel with the UE rate is nothing more than an attempt to shoot down something because it might look good for someone you don t like 
PoliticalDiscussion,A slight bump in African American turnout Trending that even slightly would have pushed Clinton over the edge 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just looking at all of the factors that affect stats 
PoliticalDiscussion,In production too 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you want to  well ackshually the stats to allow you to disregard them this conversation is finished  They ve been measured the same way for decades If you have an issue with that take it up with the BLS 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt full percentage point is dramatically more praiseworthy than Obama dropping it almost    I never said it was   I said they were both great    gt U  already excludes people who aren t looking for work  no it doesn t You can apply to a job once a month and still be considered  looking for work  And as I said a lot of people are just in between jobs Many of that  have only been an unemployed for a week or two 
PoliticalDiscussion,It wasn t unanimous Rep Massie opposed it however he wasn t included in the recorded vote How democratic 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is basically a gish gallop to fail to address why Trump bringing it down less than  full percentage point is dramatically more praiseworthy than Obama dropping it almost    It also indicates that you don t understand how unemployment is measured as the rate we are referring to U  already excludes people who aren t looking for work U  a rate which includes discouraged job seekers and chronically underemployed is historically about x the U rate   And again  the president has very little influence on the unemployment rate Giving either president credit for either is not appropriate 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is though The lower it gets the harder it is Less people in the bottom  want to work whereas the people between  to  percent are probably actively looking and trying and we re unemployed by the market crash And he did hit record lows I m not saying that Obama necessarily did a bad at unemployment but Trump did a really great job also I wouldn t expect Trump to be able to get like a  unemployment rate when you start with them at that low There are people who don t want to work And people who aren t really actively looking 
PoliticalDiscussion,No if they were smart they would ve have made the  election be between  senile rapists 
PoliticalDiscussion,Point of clarification as of   the house has passed the bill as well and sent it to Trump for signature 
PoliticalDiscussion,As much as I love Warren losing her Senate seat would be a poor move 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes he did  but the point is that dropping the rate from   to  isn t all that impressive at all If you want to give credit for the low unemployment rate you should take someone who started off with a shit deal and turned if into a decade of continuous economic growth He dropped the unemployment rate almost an order of magnitude more than Trump managed to and that s nothing to you  All that being said the president has very little ability to positively impact the economy no matter who they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,An actual medical professional would never attempt to diagnose someone without examining them  You should know that if you were in fact one    And some casual profile snooping suggests that you re actually an EMS who shouldn t be diagnosing anything at all let alone cognitive disorders 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Unemployment actually exists closer to   during normal economic conditions No idea who told you   is normal but it s very much not  I think I was thinking of black unemployment rates Obama came into presidency at the beginning of a recession 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s saying Biden needs to go third way Third Way is what killed the democratic party and is why Hillary lost Pushing for unfettered neoliberal economics with a dash of idpol crap to win over people on social issues isn t fooling people anymore rd way democrats are Rockefeller Republicans Nobody represents labor anymore we have  big business parties one that is conservative and one that is reactionary And they act surprised when they get low turnout  And Sinema Biden already appeals to the blue dogs Why take an even more conservative running mate Republicans aren t flipping to vote for Biden They ll still vote for Trump Also Arizona is pretty red Why risk losing that seat She also voted to confirm Barr which isn t going to win over Democratic leaning voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh absolutely Jones is screwed just like Scott Brown was in  What I m saying is Minnesota is a lot more evenly divided then Alabama or Massachusetts are In fact Minnesota voted to the right of the country in  Clinton s margin there was lower than her national one 
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt The early signs Biden is showing is memory loss confusion and he s having trouble holding conversations    We need to look into the   oringes    oringes    oringes  oranges of the investigation God blesh the Uniter Shathes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Catherine Cortez Masto I think If you consider state AG executive experience 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That is actually huge Unemployment rates usually exist between  and   Trump had it below      Obama had it to below   Trump got it down to  So if you want to give credit to someone it should be the person who dropped  the rate from over  in  to   in January   Trump took office at the end of that month  not the guy who took it from  to   Unemployment actually exists closer to   during normal economic conditions No idea who told you   is normal but it s very much not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well everyone makes mistakes once in a while but with Biden it s almost everyday that I see something new  The early signs Biden is showing is memory loss confusion and he s having trouble holding conversations All early warning signs I also refuse to believe that you guys haven t noticed it I think you guys are choosing to overlook it   We need to demand brain imaging to be done on him Or at the very least he needs to pick a good VP because he will probably have to take over soon if Biden becomes president 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah the ever convincing argument by bare assertion  Harris went out of her way to implement a dozen reforms in the judicial system I would go link them for you but I already know that doing so would be a waste of my time You have already shown you re uninterested in facts    p s It basically is the job of a prosecutor to prosecute They don t write the law 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean the one on one debate he had with Bernie Sanders that lasted several hours actually Cuz y know I typed debate and all This is some severe projection given your apparent preferred presidential candidate s obvious incoherence Do you need that nuclear quote repeated  And he s gotten an astonishingly small rally to the flag bounce It would be more important if this weren t March and things weren t projected to get much much worse in the next few months 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is actually huge Unemployment rates usually exist between  and   Trump had it below      is over  million people It led to record low unemployment rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,You mean the last speech he gave where he became disoriented and his wife that he thinks is his sister had to come and rescue him  Also in case you haven t heard most people agree with Trump s handling of the virus His approval has risen above  due to his handling of the virus 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Didn t vote for Trump because I think he s legitimately mentally incompetent regardless of his politics   Please don t take this the wrong way but I m curious  Would you vote for someone who had the same policies as Trump but was actually mentally competent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah demanding people go along with all the stuff you want is not exactly a good way to get bipartisan support  But now worries I never hated the aca even if he did lie and I had to switch doctors 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you actually speaking as a medical professional Or are you allowing your biases to distort your view on a candidate  I m not asking rhetorically In the age of the internet it s easy to scrounge up ammunition for any viewpoint you could want I could cherry pick Obama s mistakes and misquotes for hours not because he was in decline but because he was human and made errors when speaking I have elderly family members who I am watching slide and it s awful I ve seen nothing of the sort from either presidential candidate  So what medical signs make his dementia obvious you 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only problem I see with her is the risk of losing her seat 
PoliticalDiscussion,You   You do know TPP never got passed right Like that is actual literal fake news It was dead before Trump because it couldn t pass the Senate   And drawing back from NATO has nothing to do with pulling back from the MIC when he s pushing for and getting more domestic military spending  But hey if you re so worried about job losses Trump s genius response to the coronavirus just put at least  million people on unemployment so he s failing on thayt pretty badly too 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see what Harris brings to the ticket that makes her the best choice 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt you actually think Trump has pushed back against the MIC  Yes he got Nato members to increase their commitment by  billion and decreased our commitment by    Also what promises were not kept I remember Obama campaigning against NAFTA and he not only left it in place but then went on to sign an even bigger deal the TPP It was Trump that came in and renegotiated NAFTA and buried the TPP that would have costs us even more job losses 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except the Republicans have the votes anyway You agree to vote for X under threat Y would be chosen instead
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not true He tried desperately for the ACA to have bipartisan support He was far nicer than he should have been 
PoliticalDiscussion,He was just fine in the last debate I d wager he ll do just fine against  No puppet no puppet you re the puppet    And honestly the debates don t matter much anyway Trump s incompetence in handling Covid alone is going to have us in the beginnings of a major recession he s cooked 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they were then she could have voted no again
PoliticalDiscussion,Liberals enjoy there echo chambers Mainstream news is liberal except for fox Fox leads in ratings though
PoliticalDiscussion,The tax cuts dropped unemployment by about    Not super dramatic Not nothing either but not some huge windfall for workers 
PoliticalDiscussion,The spanish flu was killing people within    hours  It was  years ago  Science has gotten a lot better Get some faith in  years of science since then Are you a DOOMER 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In  Republicans lost a special election for senate in Alabama  Barely while running one of the weakest Senate candidates imaginable and are likely to win that seat back in a general election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Holy fucking shit you actually think Trump has pushed back  against the MIC  That s a hot take I d never have imagined I d see in a million years especially since he will absolutely bluster about how he has rebuilt out  depleted military  also a lie but hey who cares anymore   Trump is actually keeping far fewer promises as a percentage than most presidents But that tends to happen when you make dozens of inherently contradictory promises 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh wow great point That was an excellent informative and well sourced reply that completely nullified his position 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are insane Trump has brought fair trade no new wars economic growth he rolled back the prison industrial complex and released thousands from prison he also rolled back the military industrial complex by putting more responsibility on other Nato countries to carry their own weight   Not to mention that he protected the rights of men against unfair accusations in colleges and made sure that no  MeToo bullshit gets signed into law He also is fighting for workers by stopping the influx of cheap labor   While you keep supporting the same politicians that never done anything for you before Trump also has more integrity than other politicians because he actually keeps his promises 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dont think theres a huge single issue marijuana vote and even if she personally hates marijuana it does not matter No way in hell a biden admin would let her mess with legal states  it would be  political suicide If the rapid anti drug sessions backed Trump admin could not touch legal no admin from here out will be able too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you serious Have you been watching Biden He is confused more often than not and he can t get any facts straight anymore That is rapidly advancing dementia I also speak as a medical professional   Sure everyone makes mistakes once in a while and says the wrong thing but with Biden its everyday You are holding on to woke bullshit to the detriment of the country You don t even care about Biden if you want him to run against Trump He s only going to embarrass himself I even feel bad that Trump is going to have to go on stage and humiliate and old man with dementia  Biden needs to step down and spend this time with his family 
PoliticalDiscussion,My best guess is defiantly kamala harris most likely followed by amy klobuchar or stacy abrams My personal choices would be Pete Buttigieg or Tammy Duckworth 
PoliticalDiscussion,You hopefully don t know the implications of what you re asking Is the economy fails people will starve People will get sick and die And I m not talking about billionaires The tax cuts that Trump did dramatically lowered unemployment and decrease poverty in the US I feel like people want it to fail just so that Trump will look bad I find that incredibly selfish
PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton was objectively one of the more liberal senators during her time there and ran on the most progressive platform in American history Biden was and is the same  You can think either should have been even more left wing but they re not really centrists in the context of American politics
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but this is a pretty sobering event in most peoples lives If this continues for another month or two I have faith in the education of most people that it will make us better and smarter people down the road 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anything that can be said about Biden can be said even more about Trump so that s not a great comparison 
PoliticalDiscussion,That was an earlier version
PoliticalDiscussion,If we suffer now and learn from our mistakes while putting in a better system that isnt rigged for the wealthy then I will take that future any day I m not about short term feel good solutions that put us in the same situation later That s how businesses  aka Trump run things 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only as long as this lasts then they will run out and get that coffee Most people I know do not prepare for tomorrow just how it is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do we think people are going to be a lot more stringent with their money now though Like we are realizing we dont need our  coffee everyday or to go the bar every weekend and so on Also people will be more stingy as a reaction to not being financially prepared for a sudden negative change 
PoliticalDiscussion,Worked for John McCain Wait nevermind    
PoliticalDiscussion,If Trump is smart  which he isn t here s what he should do  The day after Biden picks Harris Trump immediately decriminalizes Marijuana Then he runs to the left of Biden and Harris on criminal justice reform 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the Governors are all off the table for now since their states all really need them at home to manage the state response to the pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for your input Do you think that either of the following factors may be playing a role  A Wyoming is a deep red state already and turning it blue would be difficult even without Trump  B While coal has collapsed it was going down that road for a long time already Trump at least put on a big show of addressing those concerns when other politicians had written them off entirely  The way I see it even if Trump s die hard supporters will support him no matter what independents and Obama Trump voters may not feel the same way and there are a lot more of those in purple states Or at least I hope that s the case   
PoliticalDiscussion,Between sanity and the opposite
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That s actually false California Republicans are constantly silenced by the electoral college as are Texas Democrats That s right not just Austin  Has no relevance to what I said but yes in democracy the minority arent usually the winners    gt Which is why we need to make it NOT a waste of money with a proper system that does not silence them  No real way to do that Most people arent swing voters and there isnt a big reason for anyone to spend where it wont go far Youd still see spending targeted just different targets   gt  Which is also a bad thing  Good and bad are subjective 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s adopted part of warren and Bernies platform  What else do they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,You clearly don t understand how the electoral college works or how it s votes are allocated  The census determines electoral college votes via congressional apportionment These congressional districts can also be gerrymandered but that has no impact whatsoever on the electoral college vote drawn from it In fact only two states award EC votes by congressional district 
PoliticalDiscussion,I actually think a multi party system might do the exact opposite it might force the parties to cooperate more it will open up new perspectives and make them part of the mainstream and parties will simply have to be more open to compromise It will definitely liven up the discourse and make it more civilized   less polarized though as you had mentioned  Edit Corrected   our  to   the  because I got carried away it seems and forgot I m not American
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t turnout improve if you know your vote counts Right now there s no reason for Republicans in California to vote at all or for Democrats in the south to vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Everyone gets  point Right now Alabama get  and California gets  I made up those numbers because I don t know what the real ones are but the idea that some states are more equal than others is a big problem Right now Ohio and Florida have all the power The Meth State and the Idiot State and the fact that either one could count for either state doesn t help 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the opposite Everyone counts in a popular vote election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Speaking of Missouri I could see it swinging back to a Blue state by the s I don t know if it would be Safe but definitely a Blue leaning swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion, That s actually false California Republicans are constantly silenced by the electoral college as are Texas Democrats That s right not just Austin  Which is why we need to make it NOT a waste of money with a proper system that does not silence them  Which is also a bad thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,No no the Electoral College gives some states more votes than other based whether they have enough rich guys to draw blatantly bullshit districts that give them more power Often times without the vote of the people What I m proposing is the people of the state deciding who the state goes for with  state vote making each vote worth an equal amount and every small individual vote one that can change the state s mind Alabama has plenty of blue and California a lot of red These people are silenced through the electoral College meanwhile my system says they could be the winner 
PoliticalDiscussion,America is been through depression before but instead of being on a war machine maybe we can get onto something else a little easier to sustain 
PoliticalDiscussion,Um all the systems work for the wealthy  There isnt one one system where there arent wealthy with a ton of power and a ton of money big difference is our wealthy arent shooting us 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t ignore Wisconsin Michigan and PA Could easily swing R like Ohio has
PoliticalDiscussion,Why s that a problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,We ve had a two party system since 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That doesn t work and creates a power vacuum of only a few states  No it wouldn t   it would make every voter count equally regardless of which state you live in and the winner would be the candidate who got the most votes  It would basically be the nation wide equivalent of a US governor election   gt More likely something like ranked voting would work better  That could address different issues  eg the risk of vote splitting but it wouldn t change the issue of voters in solid red or solid blue states mattering less than voters in swing states 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like part of the reason why some states have a low voter turnout is because of the electoral college system why would a democrat in Kansas or a republican in California vote if the state is just gonna turn blue or red and their vote will be basically worthless 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those sound like things that everyone hates about cities
PoliticalDiscussion,I doubt it this honestly is showing the people they dont need to save and prepare for disasters if the government is going to bail them out of an issue Yeah it sucks people losing jobs people not being able to pay rent on the first But none of them are going to learn to sacrifice to prepare themselves for any disaster 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that a multiple party system can be a great strength and disservice It will definitely make people less partisan and decrease polarization but it would also create a lot more gridlock in Congress because there are so many different parties all over the page turn with different demands for what they want
PoliticalDiscussion,It was warned from day one but we didnt build the House like a parliament and the senate got screwed when we started voting them in instead of the states selecting them 
PoliticalDiscussion,How would you solve the problem of voter turnout disparities amongst the states Minnesota New Hampshire and Maine had   turnout in  while over  states were under   
PoliticalDiscussion,In other words     things that Republicans hate about cities the most 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there any evidence that such a movement of people is happening 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio Iowa not even toss ups anymore safe red states perhaps Ohio becomes the new texas Pennsylvania and Wisconsin likely red Michigan leans red Minnesota   Maine lean red Virginia and Colorado safe blue NC like Virginia is now Arizona like leans blue Nevada likely blue Texas Georgia Florida Delaware New Hampshire toss ups Also CT RI and IL get lean likely blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,If there is any major voting shifts over the next decade I would say the most likely result is that the Midwest goes from being a swing region to reliably Republican while the Southwest  plus Texas goes from being reliably Republican to swing although I d say that the former will probably happen more quickly than the latter  if it happens which would put the Democrats at a disadvantage for a while  There is also the chance  albeit much smaller and possibly farther in the future that Georgia and North Carolina  normally reliably red trend more competitive at the same time the whiter New England states like Maine and New Hampshire  reliably blue also get more competitive 
PoliticalDiscussion,High taxes ballooning rent suffocating restrictions and regulations and other political failures of their home states 
PoliticalDiscussion,The meth man 
PoliticalDiscussion,That doesn t work and creates a power vacuum of only a few states  More likely something like ranked voting would work better 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see Georgia becoming much more competitive and straying away from the GOP with the growth of the Atlanta metropolitan area 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas Arizona and Georgia I can see them getting competitive I ll need more data on Wisconsin before I can see them trending Republican I don t see Kansas or Oregon going competitive 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree There are definitely some Bernie or bust people out there but most of them that I know in real life are willing to vote biden However the number seems to be decreasing Biden needs to do something to gain their confidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is an impossible question to answer There are certain demo trends to look at sure However they don t mean much Yes a lot of ppl are bailing on high tax states like Cali NY and so on But they re leaving because of what is a result of Dem policies There s just no avoiding it high taxes are a part of Dem plans not saying thats bad   Assuming ppl who left Blue states for Red ones or visa versa will make those states purple is a tiny bit flawed because they left  for a reason    There s also age to consider Younger more progressive voters hitting  and so on  That age group is unreliable and ppl are proven to become more conservative as they age So assuming they will change things much in the next decade is also risky   The real reason states are becoming more competitive is because of MASSIVE campaign efforts by the democrats Republicans have gotten lazy and are taking too many states for granted That  will change As an example over  dems in Va ran un opposed Its unlikely that ll happen too many more times And the epic investment of s of millions into failed dem campaigns in Ga and Tx is likely to wake republicans up   And of course candidates matter Dems need something that isn t a Biden and Rs need more than Trump Who that is will make a lot of difference 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you are proposing is literally the electoral college minus the proportionality based on population size States already conduct popular votes to determine allocation of electoral college votes If every state is pretty purple like you claim then why do states like Alabama always go red in their popular vote and California always go blue in their popular vote What you propose would be an objectively worse system in terms of how much each person s vote is worth 
PoliticalDiscussion,You think Puerto Rico will be a state in the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s easy to accomplish Tell people to vote randomly Swing states have power because every other state citizens sre locked in  A Republican campaigning in California is not happening because its a waste of money Democratic presidents therefore can spend less there because Republicans won t The citizens decided they didn t want go make themselves competitive so they aren t  Note that despite your comment safe states have a lot of power at times Without Texas no Republican president can win Without California and NY democrats would struggle 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas The cities are already blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,No each state is actually pretty purple when you look at it What we need is for each state to matter equally and this would force the candidates to hit all the states and get their message across as much of each state as possible Not just Florida and Ohio 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe I m failing to understand what you re proposing but it sounds even more inequitable than the electoral college E g California and Wyoming gets one point 
PoliticalDiscussion,The two party system has absolutely wrecked America It would be amazing if you had multiple major parties for instance imagine if you had Democratic Republican Libertarian Green Constitution to choose from  since those last  are the biggest third parties atm and represent several parts of the political spectrum  I think everybody would be at the very least not entirely dissatisfied if they had that large of a choice Almost all European countries would still have many many more parties and choices though   
PoliticalDiscussion,   she has a demographic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida will always be a swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion, This acts exactly like the current electoral college except it would give even more power to small unpopulated red states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Serious question what do you see as the motivation to move there 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no indication Kansas will be While the third district KCK swung Democrat in  its still only a single district with a narrow edge Even in a decade I dont think Kansas City kansas metro will grow large enough to bottle up the state Remember over half the metros in Missouri  That s assuming nothing changes politically in a decade which seems unlikely  You may see Nebraska split since it splits its EC by district with  at large and Omaha  think its Omaha has been bleeding its red out for blue No major effect since its  EC but still 
PoliticalDiscussion,Safe state DC Swing state Puerto Rico
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  We could still regulate points of entry have a wall and not allow entry to people who are known criminals   That would by definition not be an open border An open border is exactly what it sounds like no control whatsoever No politician currently holding any elected office in the federal government  President congress is in favor of that Even the most liberal people on the issue would like your passport checked and stamped at the border    gt  It would give our police and government more ability to focus on drugs and gang activity by no longer needing to allocate resources to deporting  burrito sellers and gardeners  Ideally we should not have police and government resources on those things at all Gangs and organized crime develops around the criminalized activities in an area There are no gangs that deal in cigarettes  except in prison where cigarettes are banned   There are no gangs that deal in selling black market pet food or whatever If you legalize drugs prostitution and gambling the illegal organizations dealing in those industries will collapse overnight because they cannot compete with legal businesses which exercise economies of scale  As an example Altria can make cigarettes for pennies each using advanced machines and manufacturing techniques It would be effortless to swap the tobacco with marijuana and put it on the shelves of the hundreds of thousands of gas stations and convenience stores in every corner of the US which are already under contract to carry Altria s products  Altria owns dozens of brands including Marlboro for those who don t know   Altria could single handedly price every single pot dealer out of the market in less than a month According to their CEO the only reason they aren t in the marijuana busisness is because they want federal legalization first  That is just one example but you get the idea Gangs and organized crime are a construct caused by outlawing certain things As someone whose wife works at the FBI I can tell you that law enforcement agents around the country know this is true They know organized crime is a government created problem The people at the top just don t care    gt  Immigrants are economically equivalent to people fresh out of high school They tend to be a burden on the system cost money for the first few years while they find a job get settled and then eventually begin to pay taxes  Not really true Very few immigrants are actually a burden to begin with  A new immigrant to the US will have access to zero government benefit services but will still be expected to pay all sales taxes on their purchases all income taxes on their income and all property taxes on any property they buy If they literally just sit at home and do nothing all day except look out the window at the car they own they are paying taxes since we pay car taxes annually People become numb to the amount of taxes we pay which is why you often hear certain people say immigrants contribute nothing or are a burden 
PoliticalDiscussion,It d still just be two parties But at least Republicans in California and Democrats in Kansas would be allowed to have opinions 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree and someone like Tammy Baldwin does both She is from WI  a swing state we need and a progressive who campaigned with Bernie  so she can try and court some of his voters  She also is an LGBT woman which is a demographic that I bet Biden does poorly with to be honest 
PoliticalDiscussion,I personally would say a series of state run popular votes where each state is just  point on a grander scheme of things and that point is decided by that singe state s popular vote Also in this system DC and any territory we aren t representing properly become states as well who also count on this point system 
PoliticalDiscussion,The split in the DNC might push the far left to stay home The Biden ticket assuming he doesnt take Warren as VP and goes someone like Harris he could end up putting a state like California or even NY up as a swing state   Joe s declining mental acuity will be on full display when the DNC no longer controls the debate and he has to face Trump who wont hold back like Bernie has   We will see but I think it s likely with the disillusionment of the far left we could see a very red map this year 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks man I appreciate the sympathy  really do im sorry if this reads as sarcastic I haven t been sober in a week  I have three relatives on ventilators and four people I know who are showing symptoms Living in NYC means I will know a lot of people who are going to die soon and the dude who is responisble for it will get re elected so I m very blackpilled right now
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s the opposite in this case It s what Biden can bring to the ticket instead of Harris   IMO the Dem party already feels like Biden can beat Trump So the Harris pick would be more about giving her name recognition for another future run and grooming her as the next Dem superstar   Biden is a prime example of what being attached to a successful ticket can do directly a future presidential bid 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do think that we are naturally moving towards the  left  The rate at which we do it is another topic and I think demographical impacts  i e the number of Hispanics in the south continue to naturally grow will be a huge influence   I think we will see more southern states turn into swing states I think the Hispanic population can make a considerable impact   I guess the other argument would have to be peoples reception to policies within the next decade  For all we know we might have a democratic president for the next  years and then see people lose support for left leaning policies for a host of reasons  this also goes towards right leaning policies that might not be well received  So it will be dependent on the next president as well whether now or  years from now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Precisely why we need to abolish the electoral college and switch to a nationwide popular vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,TBH they weren t voting for Biden anyways They aren t progressives they are Bernie fans   And this is why Democrats should only go so far in trying to appeal them Chances are they won t show up to vote for Democrats anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hadn t heard of her but that can be a good thing She seems like the kind of person I d put my money on for something like this 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see Texas as a swing state not starting from the s but already possibly starting from  thanks to the major demographic changes going on there Arizona I definitely expect to start going blue from  onwards as well and I m not entirely sure about the Midwest The south won t change much at all but might become  slightly  less red Overall I don t see Republicans growing over the next  years unless they reform and become normal after Trump s presidency 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would you say that the population shifts would make places like Kentucky and Tennessee more competitive or would they still be red states Also would that make Ohio and Pennsylvania more blue despite Ohio s recent red tread 
PoliticalDiscussion,Woah  You lost your aunt to Covid   Wow  Truly and genuinely sorry for your loss  I hope you take the time to heal  There will be time for politicking in a few months 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s only because people are so partisan when voting
PoliticalDiscussion,I missed the  the before  s and the plural  elections at the end My bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,The best choice would be Warren to get the far left back he will pick Harris because the DNC is insane   No one can balance the ticket though due to his poor health alot of voters may feel that te VP is going to be president so they need to be able to stand on their own 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think for the average American who watches the news this could be a good push for Trump in which congress is still able to pass socially supporting legislation with him in office  depending on what you define as social legislation  I m still interested in what will happen to his approval rating   I think this entire commotion and lack of preparedness can be attributed to both sides of congress No one was prepared I m happy this was unanimous though as it shows that congress still has respect for its citizens Now lets see what happens within the next month 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was referring to all elections in the  s sorry if it was unclear 
PoliticalDiscussion,States in Appalachia will drift to Democrats as people move there changing the demographic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly we should think less about who is already swing or safe and ask how we can make all of them Swing states This is the very problem with our system only  states have any real power 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhhh there won t be any presidential election in  
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no way to make purity test type of progressives change their mind at this point honestly And their states will already vote blue Biden would do better courting the larger voting demographics in swing states 
PoliticalDiscussion,   What happened to  Believewomen  Oh wait it was all bullshit This is more credible than Kavanaugh s story but because this guy has a blue tie he obviously aint a rapist Pathetic have fun losing to Trump in november     
PoliticalDiscussion,The first point they make means this isnt an open border at all so what s the point of the rest 
PoliticalDiscussion, new cases since my last message plus  deaths   gt The spanish flu was killing people within    hours  It was  years ago  Science has gotten a lot better  Correct now we can keep those patients in ICU beds on ventilators for weeks   I m an optimist not a  doomer and not someone burying their head in the sand 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was on Yahoo news and was then moved to the sports section which is probably just an error but suspicious considering the subject matter It has also been covered on VOX which is a progressive but reputable site I have heard they are old accusations and also that they may be illegitimate but they are at least worth looking into considering the woman did legitimately work for Biden at one point   Even if these accusations are untrue and I hope they are Biden still needs a strategy because this news will be used to disenfranchise naive progressives and swing voters I am already seeing my friends on twitter saying they  won t be forced to choose between two rapists  Once Fox starts covering it all of the time the republicans will have an easy time trashing Biden too
PoliticalDiscussion,Not with the current state of Mexico and its government   With the rampant corruption in Mexico we wont be able to trust them to tell us who is and isnt a criminal   We would also have to abolish all social programs or ban those comming over from them which would especially include the ER we would also need a deal so we arent just having people come here commit crimes then burden our prison system   Lastly you ay open border but then say still have border checks       those are antithetical It sounds like you re just calling for what we already have and saying it s open border with checks   A border with checks is not an open border Period   Open borders for the US will always be a net negative for the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,you re going to have to provide sources for a lot of the things you just said
PoliticalDiscussion,Proof 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida could turn into the worst most plague affected part of the country in the history of ever the state could lose three quarters of its population and the videos of people choking on their own sputum to death could be broadcast   from here to November and Jesus Christ could personally come down and anoint the democratic nominee whilst damning every Trump voter as the second coming of Judas and Trump would still win Fuck he might even gain votes  You don t understand Americans it s okay I had issues with it too until I left NYC in the Navy and saw this shithole s true face lemme copy and paste how this crisis is making me feel right now from another thread because I think it sums it up  My fucking aunt died from this last night because that fucking jackass in the white house cut our pandemic response to ribbons for a fucking invisible line  Fuck this country I hope it burns but it won t Because Americans are a fundamentally weak people A weak emasculated useless people who will dutifully walk to work next week and doom countless innocents because for some fucking reason a nation borne out of armed resistance has less balls than the fucking British we saved ourselves from
PoliticalDiscussion,You people are toxic and full of hate
PoliticalDiscussion,That depends on how hard the disease and economic impacts hit swing states  Think of Florida for example  Full of old people  Just finished Spring Break and Mardi Gras  What do you think it s going to be like in two weeks 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Duckworth is a repeat of the Kerry  playbook Didn t work then  I was typing out a comment on swiftboating until I realized you never mentioned that  If that s what you were getting at I don t think it would work on Duckworth as well Besides the fact that the population has been sort of inoculated to that kind of lying she s literally missing two of her legs 
PoliticalDiscussion,That would be illegal Massey isn t part of the senate though that s the house Congress is composed of two levels  the senate  two for each state and the house  an amount roughly proportional to a state s population  The House voted today but this post was in reference to the Senate which voted unanimously    in favour of this bill Hope this helps
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes it s called constitutional jurisprudence  the opposite of tyranny  One of the major reforms of the US constitution was to eliminate the practice of making the written law effectively change depending on whether or not the king and or his prosecutors liked you or not Boundless prosecutorial discretion is also the basis for the Jim Crow practice of letting whites murder non whites with impunity 
PoliticalDiscussion,not voting for a rapist
PoliticalDiscussion,Going to be honest the only place I ve even seen those accusations is on Reddit and the corners of the internet foaming at the mouth to take Biden down   If I m not mistaken they are old accusations they didn t get much traction due to a lack of credibility   Please correct me if I m wrong but I ve searched a number of sources and they aren t picking it up 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree with your assessment nobody cares We are seeing true leadership out of several governors right now including DeWine in Ohio and Beshear in Kentucky They are making tough choices that will likely hurt them with some voters but are doing it to protect their citizens and it is working They acted quickly and stepped up when the federal government under Trump did nothing This might sound shocking but I think a lot of congress people Democrats and Republicans care about their constituents when it comes to something like this That s why they re passing massive bailouts and are actively grilling Trump officials as to why there are not enough tests and equipment out there      For two month Trump actively ignored the warnings either because he was too ignorant to believe them or simply didnt care One is a failure in leadership The other is a failure in humanity All while he had access to more information and intelligence than anyone else in the entire country Either are disqualifying in my book 
PoliticalDiscussion,The sexual assault stuff from today will definitely not help Biden     Honestly not sure what his strategy in regards to the accusations should be going forward
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio is going to stay purple for awhile 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio will be irrelevant this time around which is coming from an Ohioan though it will be nice to not have too much attention on us  Florida even is not that important Hillary could have lost it and Ohio and still won in  if she kept her  blue wall  Of course if Dems win either of those states it would be a big hit to Trump but he s going to win Ohio by a solid  or  points save some big thing that brings him down  It ll come down to Minnesota Wisconsin Pennsylvania and maybe Arizona depending on how many more Californians moved in since  
PoliticalDiscussion,No they re terrible But I m wondering why the fact that voter turnout varies by state is an obstacle in the way of removing the electoral college If anything I d think that s a  reason to get rid of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The electoral college  should be a balance of states rights vs popular vote That s what it s there for Right now we ve swung too hard in the state s rights direction  You are correct At the limits  electoral college vote per person  is the popular vote Likewise  total electoral college votes is full states voting In the middle though there is a spectrum of state vs popular vote weight  This is the highest office in the nation and I know that I want neither mob rule nor full state rule  The most populous states imo should have a heavier vote absolutely And they do right now California has the greatest population and the most electoral college votes but should they have exactly the same percentage of the vote as their population s proportion  Another way to ask this could be  should the state of Wyoming have approximately zero say in the executive branch of the union it swore allegiance to  
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas has been borderline swing state for awhile now
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really even without baltimore there is still the DC area that will forever dwarf any of the small republican counties in the state
PoliticalDiscussion,It s gonna be winner take all no matter what that s just democracy What I m thinking is a system where the popular vote of the state says where that state goes and the combined total of popular votes decides the outcome You actually have to win states and not some rich asshole who overrides the people s vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigan will go blue   Trump insulting Governor  major outbreak there an people like Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really It s always the same few states Always Florida and Ohio 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean most everyone who is against Biden now for not being Bernie enough will just attack him for  flip flopping  I ve seen that countless times in Reddit comments for the free college adoption  Hell people don t believe me on things Biden has been consistently very left with for decades because they ve seen so many memes calling Biden conservative Truth isn t swaying people here 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is  waayyyyy to early to tell      but if I had to answer Georgia 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s more red then the rest of the nation but streaks aren t indicative really Minnesota has the longest blue streak in the nation but i wouldn t consider it a  deep blue state 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I meant Republicans and people open to voting Republican won t vote for the Democrats just because they ve got a vet on the ticket And Clinton ran a very  patriotic campaign in  no one cared 
PoliticalDiscussion,SORRY FOR THE TYPO IN THE TITLE It s meant to say  What effect if any  My apologies 
PoliticalDiscussion,It might help to use a news aggregator but most media outlets are not slanted towards the left Some have slight left leans in the topics they cover but scroll through Google News you ll see that most major publications have a mix of meticulously neutral headlines and headlines that just parrot what Trump says without criticism 
PoliticalDiscussion,How The very concept of states deciding elections only exists in the first place because of the electoral college With it you have California splitting its electoral vote   Without it you would have California voters splitting their individual votes by  plausible example  million to  million 
PoliticalDiscussion,And by truths you mean lies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting point at the end I actually had a discussion with my roommate about this but from the Democrat point of view Let s say Biden gets the nomination but doesnt win in November Do you think that we will see a rise in more progressive candidates come the next election Would we see a more galvanised support for the democratic party in general I feel like that s why many republicans wanted to see Sanders as the nomination  besides the fact that Sanders is a wild card within his own party let alone the entire American constituency  
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see Texas going blue in like  years if it keeps getting bluer at the rate it is 
PoliticalDiscussion,The GOP has won every governor senate and presidential race in Florida since  Moreover they ve won every orher state wide race as well with the single exception of the  Agricultural Commissioner race which they lost by less than  votes   in as mentioned above a very good year for Democrats That s data indicative of a deep red state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely a valid point 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the mechanism under liquid democracy which enables you to transfer representation between representatives should your default representative displease you A liquid democratic legislature would have a total number of votes equal to the number of people and their proxies so if there are say   voters there would be a   total number of votes in congress and you would need   to pass something So for example let s say that A congressional district in Utah has  and a CD in Washington has   By default the representative from Utah gets  votes in congress and Washington gets   But let s say that a Utah liberal hates their congressman but likes one in Washington he could transfer his proxy to Washington so now the Utah representative has  votes in congress and the Washington rep has   
PoliticalDiscussion,Fl rida and Ohio are all that matter
PoliticalDiscussion, gt An open border is exactly what it sounds like no control whatsoever No politician currently holding any elected office in the federal government  President congress is in favor of that Even the most liberal people on the issue would like your passport checked and stamped at the border   The difference would be that there would be no limit to how much you could travel between Mexico and the United States It would be like traveling between countries in Europe but there would still be points of entry and you would have to show ID    gt Ideally we should not have police and government resources on those things at all Gangs and organized crime develops around the criminalized activities in an area  Ideally sure but we are limited by budgets    gt Not really true  A lot of people complain that they put their children in our schools use welfare etc You re right A lot of them do pay taxes and work jobs But so do a lot of people out of high school
PoliticalDiscussion,I just cant see it being given statehood political pressure is against adding more senators to either party for any reason Puerto Rico would be hard pressed to be independent they have no monetary system and barely have an economy without the US Hell WITH the US they arent in great place   I suspect the Federal government would simply pass some act that fixs minor issues and keeps passing the buck anf that pleases nobody but doesn t cause enough issues either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is that a problem though if the most populous states get the most votes toward president To me it doesn t seem any different than the fact that the majority race gender age demographic and religion get the most votes towards determining the president  And for your third item as the number of electoral votes approaches a high number doesn t that revert to majority vote anyways  Just trying to understand as I ve never thought of this approach before 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t forget ranked choice voting Might not have a lot to do with balancing states influences but it needs to be implemented regardless 
PoliticalDiscussion,Number one is more important to Perdue imo simply because it seems more likely to be passed
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Would you expect Arizona to consistently go blue while Wisconsin consistently votes Republican Will somewhere unexpected like Kansas or Oregon become competitive  Every blue state will likely become a swing state if not a red state Every swing state will become a red state  This opinion is due partly because of the super weak candidate choice for the democratic party nomination how the democratic party was blocking the emergency stimulus bill for non emergency partisan aligned fluff points how they repeatedly defended scummy actions of their members  like racist comments anti semitic actions etc  and how they have weaponized social media sites and news agencies like Reddit CNN nytimes etc to shut down dialog and bury truths that benefit the right and Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very interesting I ll have to do some personal research 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump s tax changes directly targeted blue states like California and New York One interesting side affect of that is people are moving out of these states and into red states  Colorado is more blue than purple now Texas is purple with a red tint I would bet that in the next  years Texas will be solidly purple with a blue tint 
PoliticalDiscussion,The comment I was replying to contemplated how we could make every state a  swing state  I was not at all suggesting we abolish the EC for the purpose of making third parties viable  I m in favor of both of those things to separate ends 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except us city folk like the benefits we get from our high taxes and regulations Like a higher standard of living You re right that people are getting priced out of rent and moving to the sunbelt and other lower cost areas but notice they still vote for higher taxes and regulation The only issue is rent  and maybe weather  These transplants turned Arizona purple real quick It s quite possible that cities get better at zoning and you see East Asia style development in certain areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,It comes down to a few states yes but those states change somewhat frequently New York was the big swing state in the Gilded Era then it was Missouri California was a swing state when it was middle class dominated  More recently it s been Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania but Ohio will be mostly irrelevant this year with states like Minnesota and Michigan being the likely ones to swing the win since they were recently safe Democrat states but repelled by the current iteration of that party 
PoliticalDiscussion,The left that loathes Harris loathes literally everyone who isn t Bernie Because Bernie is an unlikely VP pick I think that small part of the left is just lost 
PoliticalDiscussion,For sure but attempting to explain that usually results in an endless string of logical fallacies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see how the current situation is sustainable eventually it ll be squeezed out in the direction of statehood or the direction of independence Hard to say which though just like most of the answers to the original question here recent history is pushing people toward one extreme or the other but not necessarily pushing everyone the same direction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because you wouldn t need a visa to go between borders You could be a Mexican citizen and freely cross borders and live in the United States
PoliticalDiscussion,He literally couldn t Read Biden t page on  criminal justice reform   Trump and every Republican under him are insanely against getting rid of private prisons restorative justice expnding funding for mental health etc Bernie memes saying that Biden and Harris are conservative on criminal justice reform doesn t make them that by a long shot 
PoliticalDiscussion,Make electors proportionally distributed instead of winner take all 
PoliticalDiscussion,They could be reasons to move to cities without those things there are definitely cities with lower taxes than others But generally the majority of republicans who leave cities move to suburbs exurbs 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure that s true   Think of the children is a tactic of both sides and it almost always comes with a loss of liberty  The encryption law is being pushed by a Republican  Sentence lengths being increased doesn t have a political affiliation  The blue side might be interested in restricting free speech in more cases or the confiscation of guns  Perhaps the differentiation is on which of the Bill of Rights they re skirting by when they adjust laws    and  and  for Democrats          for Republicans  edit formatting edit  trying again
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean the intended purpose of our current system is explicitly anti democratic If you want to increase democracy merely by eliminating The Electoral College you would make whoever is elected elected more democratically but it does absolutely nothing to take away the forces which forces consolidation If we lived with a popular vote system and say A conservative got  of the vote a liberal got   and a progressive got   the conservative would still win because the progressive rd party acted as a spoiler which is basically everything holding rd parties back and that getting rid of The Electoral College does nothing to solve Saying that getting rid of The Electoral College therefore is a complete non sequitur when it comes to empowering rd parties it doesn t actually do anything mechanistically to help them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like you alienate people regardless of the type policy It s just who gets the short end of the stick this time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah these sound likes reasons to move from the city to the countryside not from one city to another city 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is a  liquid democratic proxy  
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a hard time imagining Kansas going blue They only have a blue governor due to a very strong hatred towards Kobach 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you mean Do you think those are good turnout rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,And none of those options are great because you re alienating some people no matter what
PoliticalDiscussion,Oregon is only getting bluer with folks moving to Portland 
PoliticalDiscussion,Electors are nominated by the parties separately Basically the party that wins the state gets to appoint the electors and then they ostensibly but not always  usually via drunken mistake  vote for the party s candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,We need to do things   ranked choice voting  Switch to the popular vote
PoliticalDiscussion,And the meth women too 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My state is red blue so what does it matter if I vote  Self fulfilling prophecy in many  safe states 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t look at a single year to determine a state s color
PoliticalDiscussion,So Maryland is a weird state If Baltimore continues its population decline I could see it potentially becoming a swing state by 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sounds like partisan propaganda to me  If you won t debate in good faith why should I continue   gt Surely you don t honestly believe California only has democrats right  No but I believe in math Lets make a hypothetical sTate lets call it reddit Reddit population is  million Its voting is  million for team Edward and  million Team Potter At  turn out the state is safe for team Edward That s math  M beats k by a margin of half Potters votes That s massive   That is what is likely to happen in most states one party  Republican Democrat shit maybe green will achieve numerical superiority and that s it Its the way Democracy works in any setting that puts population up  I simply don t think most states are a natural   close split   gt already said If you are running for National Office legally require campaigning in every state no exception  Loophole I toss  ad out in the cheapest part of the state on the cheapest medium Congrats i passed your bare minimum bar cheaply and you changed nothing Legally your suggestions are to easy to circumvent but if you make it hard its to easy to bludgeon others with it Its the way laws work  Also federally you cant do what you want not constitutionally but that s not here nor there 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that we need to get rid of our simple first past the post system to allow third parties to become viable but so long as the EC remains in place a candidate needs only a plurality of a state to earn all of its electoral votes A new voting system would be much more effective at its intended purpose if its outcome wasn t muddled by the Electoral College 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s the lowest population state that anybody pays attention to under the current system   ranked Wisconsin After that it s  ranked Arizona and then a bunch of states in the top  
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually I might agree with you but can you explain the difference between moving  left vs Moving  right   If I am correct i think the average american would link authoritarianism with the democratic party They are not synonymous of course but how would you differentiate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I think this would be a reasonable approach I d imagine that this would require the full coordination of all fifty states however because unilaterally moving to a proportional division of electoral votes wouldn t otherwise be in the interests of states that are currently predominated by one party 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean uh You haven t seen Kansas lately have you lol On the missouri side yeah we fucked up though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it will be very interesting to watch the Republican party for the next  years I agree that the demographic shifts the US is seeing are very favorable to Democrats so someone might propose that the Republicans are at a natural disadvantage a retort to that is that Republicans will adjust their platform leftward once they start losing elections I think the GOP could find themselves in a more uncomfortable situation than they expected however with their recent shift right   Romney was for all intents and purposes a candidate that seemed to be running on an attempt to moderate the Republican party I think at the time I recall that the party s post mortem analysis was discussing the very issues you re bringing up With the election of Trump the party seems to have rejected the analysis in their post mortem and taken a large step to the right While that could make a rebranding of GOP representatives more difficult I don t have any illusions that the politicians wouldn t be willing to flipflop on the sorts of identity politics that Trump is championing the second he s out of office instead I think Trump s election shows that the Republican party has a sizable constituency that might be willing to reject a more moderate candidate who doesn t seem to share their values not in a GE but in a primary   With the party s consituency running to the right will a moderate be able to win the primary over someone playing to the base If not it could lead to a situation where the party stays firmly to the right while losing more and more elections Would that cause the Republican base to move to the left Would that cause candidates across the board to move more to the left If neither of those happens it will put the GOP in a very tough spot 
PoliticalDiscussion,nationwide popular vote is not enough because it still doesn t get rid of the spoiler effect which is what actually causes consolidatory voting You need some kind of ranked choice voting For national ideological interests you would probably also need some kind of liquid democratic proxy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mail in voting Also mandatory voter registration But if you really really wanted  everyone to vote you would impose a fine for not submitting a signed ballot 
PoliticalDiscussion, Sounds like partisan propaganda to me Surely you don t honestly believe California only has democrats right   I already said If you are running for National Office legally require campaigning in every state no exception And again DC Puerto Rico and other territories would become full states under my ideal system because you need a tie breaking vote Failure to hit every state is an automatic forfeit   Explain how George Orwell did not warn us of this exact thing I ll wait   You are really implying it with a heavy hand though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you back that claim up with data Florida went red for Gov and red for Senator in a blue wave year that speaks to me as a pretty solid red state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not at all  many people in cities like those they even vote for those things 
PoliticalDiscussion,As opposed to the current system in which the same handful of swing states determines who wins the presidency  Under the electoral college you only need to win a plurality in a state to earn all of its electors This means that winning  of a state effectively gives you all of that state s votes With a popular vote system winning  of a state would only yield  of that state s votes  Whereas Senators are elected to represent states at large and Congressmen are elected to represent districts the President is elected to represent the entire population of the United States  Seeing as we already have an entire legislative body that provides equal representation to each state irrespective of population I think it d be fair for the only nationwide election to be put to a simple popular vote of a nationwide constituency 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like the reason most people leave cities and generally blue demographics in general is because cost of housing not taxes per say  Obviously they re linked but I feel like younger people will be taking their political views with them when they move  Rent is a much bigger factor for most people moving than taxes in my view 
PoliticalDiscussion,A more realistic step would be if more States distributed their Elector votes proportionally That way we don t need a full on Constitutional Amendment that might not be likely to pass but rather we can simply use State Level reforms that are more likely to go through 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio will stay red as long as Ohio s economy doesn t tank The people here will be forgiving this time around because of the perceived job done by Dewine and Dr Action in this virus fight But if the rest of the country gets back on its feet at a faster pace than Ohio Republicans could find themselves in the same boat that Strickland and the Democrats were after the  debacle 
PoliticalDiscussion,As opposed to right now where the presidency is always decided by about  states every year 
PoliticalDiscussion,A more left leaning VP pick such as Tammy Baldwin or Tammy Duckworth would be a fantastic way to start I also think he should do a better job advertising how he has adopted some of Bernie and Warrens platforms Most people don t pay attention to politics all that much and may not be aware of Biden s more left leaning platforms People may also think he is just throwing those things in there to court progressives He needs to talk about why they are good proposals and explain why he believes in him That is just my take from mulling around the Bernie and Warren subreddits as well as talking to many of my friends 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Every state is purple if you really get everyone to vote  Even if everyone votes the reality is that some if not many states would still be safe states because a large majority favours one party over the other I don t think many states would be competitive even at  turn out    gt Actually it s really easy Make it mandatory on all presidential campaigns with the penalty being forfeiting the election  I want you to detail this out then I ll shoot it full of holes I bet there are lots of flaws Example this requirement eliminates all third parties and anyone not rich enough to spend the entire cycle flying This also leaves questions Do candidates campaign in cottonwood falls or face forfeit Do you even know where cottonwood falls is    gt No this one is not  Yes good and bad are subjective   gt Also it s false that only California and New York are democrat  Nobody has said that except you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida as well it s already well on its way
PoliticalDiscussion,We re naturally moving to authoritarianism That doesn t really have a  left right bias 
PoliticalDiscussion,The African American community does not like Harris for the most part She polls terribly with black voters has a history of mass incarceration for marijuana and is also only   Jamaican and thus doesn t have generational legacy as a black person in America That s not everything but many people wrote Obama off for that same reason despite obviously being black 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then you would only go to states with high populations and not care about the rest  A stronger approach would be  fold   no more winner takes all in any state but proportional amounts  ranked choice voting  way more electoral votes to even out some of the more extreme examples
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that s the problem Backwoods states  when they only have  people but big states  when they have k 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right now there are only a handful of states where your vote counts The vast majority of states are not competitive which depresses turnout on both sides Democrats in Alabama have no reason to turn out Republicans in California are similarly discouraged Making everyone s vote count equally means that no one group is favored over the rest and everyone has equal incentive to turn out 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do believe that there are pros and cons to abolishing the electoral college system but in my opinion it will allow a larger amount of people s votes to actually count Democrats in huge metropolitan areas in red states like Texas have basically no vote when it comes to presidential elections and vice versa is true about rural people in California There probably will be people who live in rural areas who ll begin to believe that their vote doesn t count but there ll be more people in urban areas who s vote will begin to count and will have a higher chance of voting 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s actually the problem You literally explained the problem and that I am trying to solve 
PoliticalDiscussion,Switch to proportional representation as well and you ll have an end to the two party system  libertarian conservative centerist  liberal progressive  everyone gets represented Doubt that will happen though
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends who gets to choose the electors that are part of the ec And congressional apportionment has been broken since  
PoliticalDiscussion,Missouri is all about the suburbs Probably cliche but it is KCMO and St Louis are blue  and both have the city lines issues that make you think someone on ecstasy drew them  But the suburbs seem to be the real competitive location And they have a ton of them 
PoliticalDiscussion, It s entirely relevant Every state is purple if you really get everyone to vote  Actually it s really easy Make it mandatory on all presidential campaigns with the penalty being forfeiting the election  No this one is not Also it s false that only California and New York are democrat 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are ya joking  If we went popular vote the presidency would always be decided by about  states every year
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no telling how the parties will look ideologically rhetorically in the s That will have at least some impact 
PoliticalDiscussion,I  agree with this There are two reasons I often hear people give for why they didn t vote  I don t care about politics and I don t like any of the politicians and  My state is red blue so what does it matter if I vote  The question will then become whether rural America bothers to vote because they feel that no matter what NYC LA Chicago Boston Philly and Houston will decide who the president is anyway   
PoliticalDiscussion,Did you miss the part where he s called for the  allegation to be investigated  Yes you probably did  A Vox article is not proof of anything except she said something and yes it should be investigated  Just like the allegations against Kavanaugh should have been properly investigated 
PoliticalDiscussion,The reason that I think no once can accurately predict this is because demographics aren t the only things that change over time First the parties can change thereby appealing to different voters This is the most likely outcome and it s something that historically happens fairly regularly Secondly the electorate can change in response to events in the world Things like   and the current pandemic and previously the Cold War the war in Vietnam and the malaise of the s can change the priorities of voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes gerrymandering is a problem but the number of delegates each state has is determined by population What you propose would make low population rural states that are  majority red far more powerful There are far more people people in California than north Dakota and you are proposing they be both worth  vote which just gives more power to low population states than they already have 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also I think it s heavily dependent on what happens in November and how the Republican party reacts to it Do they double down on Trumpism continue this awkward state of accepting but not embracing it or reject it and go back to traditional Bush McCain Romney style conservatism 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know what the electoral college is The electoral college is exactly why his comments are true    gt Swing states have power because every other state citizens sre locked in  Locked in because of the electoral college   gt A Republican campaigning in California is not happening because its a waste of money   A waste of money because of the electoral college   gt Democratic presidents therefore can spend less there because Republicans won t   Because of the electoral college  etc etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,If this is your rationale I just hope you re not one of those folks who credits the  loss to Sanders supporters staying home 
PoliticalDiscussion,If it were feasible I d like to abolish political parties 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t say whether there s migration into Appalachia but California is seeing large numbers of people leaving to escape the high cost of living 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not suggesting you are wrong but perception is reality If people in rural areas  think that their votes will be drowned out then they may stay home Its exactly the same thing as not voting because your state is solidly blue or red the only difference being that your vote is genuinely the same as the vote of an urbanite 
PoliticalDiscussion,Considering how badly Sanders has been losing in these primaries I m not sure I d want Sanders anywhere near the ticket If he would have dropped out after Super Tuesday he d have more leverage   And the  poor vote or  far left vote hasn t proven to be a very big voting block in this election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I feel arizona could possibly go blue this election but it would be extremely close
PoliticalDiscussion,The only think I ll add here is that it was a  Republican  I know I know that banned bump stocks regarding the nd  And was it a Republican that introduced the original machine gun ban 
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigan is not trending redder  was a Blue wipeout here It ll seem even less Red in future as we won a ballot initiative to get an independent commission to un fuck our Republican gerrymandered districts 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Electoral College is the problem Do you really want to say how many votes count as one vote Because that s the Electoral Colleges one job and they decided the ratio is  Who cares we are the only ones who vote  
PoliticalDiscussion,No it wouldn t It wouldn t be decided by any state Because in a popular vote states don t vote anymore People do 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the trend of suburban areas becoming blue reaches Missouri then maybe Missouri can again be a swing state But for now the suburbs of St Louis and Kansas City are pretty red 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even Kobach might be tough to beat his loss in the governor s race was a result of kansan disapproval of Brownback Thing is Kansas doesnt really disapprove of Trump Say what you will of Trump Kansas doesnt seem to mind him  I also will note that kobachs been a mini Trump before Trump He infamously wasted a crapload of money on his hunt for illegal voting  and discovered Republican gained a lot more from it whoops  Im not sure where he falls outside economics though I think hes smart enough to fall along Republican lines 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not really True She ran a PC outrage campaign and basically as presiding over Obama s rd term There was lots of progressive stuff in the platform but nobody pays attention to the platform it s the messaging on TV 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well both parties benefit from it The whole structure of the current political institutions benefit from it I am very aware that I do not fit in any party as present Neither of them speak to me really The democratic party is the closest but even the changes they propose don t really hit on where I have issues  I wonder how many people are in my camp  How many single issue voters do you think there are that can t align to the rest of their heart s issues because they really just can t handle dead babies so they stomach voting republican no matter how contradictory or non sensical that may seem to you  Or what about people that want both national health care and guns  Those groups of people don t have a voice in our current system The people in power are both the democrats and republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why can t we make it proportional That would make every vote count I just don t get your argument against it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That s actually false   How is what he said false None of this   gt California Republicans are constantly silenced by the electoral college as are Texas Democrats That s right not just Austin  shows any of his statements to be false 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would only those votes matter Each person from those cities get exactly  vote They don t vote uniformly either  Last election is was   votes for Trump and   votes for Clinton That seems close enough to me that both parties are viable Especially considering how many people don t vote because the electoral college makes their vote useless 
PoliticalDiscussion,th is skirted by both parties it just depends on which party controls the Federal government Right now the big standoff is Sanctuary Cities states and marijuana legalization   the GOP at the federal level wants to push back on blue states not cooperating with the federal government on these issues which are just as much  states rights as the issues the GOP pushed back on during the Obama administration I m sure that once the federal government goes back to liberal control that the GOP in red states will once again sound the drums for states rights  The st amendment I would say is in a grayer area as far as partisan attacks go with supporters and detractors on both sides Libertarians many of which are GOP are more likely to be staunch st amendment supporters but there are plenty of conservatives that are trying to bypass the st amendment as well particularly with regards to the Establishment Clause Many of the free speech and assembly advocates of the th century were liberals as well chipping away at things like the Hays Code  reference Joseph Burstyn Inc v Wilson and Jim Crow laws  I d also say the GOP have some minor grievances with the th amendment as well given that a bunch of SCOTUS rulings have come down against them in the th century that mentioned this amendment particularly Griswold v Connecticut It s also the one amendment strict constructionists like Scalia hate the most  As it stands the only amendment from the Bill of Rights that the GOP unilaterally and unequivocally supports against Democrat infringement is the nd and the only amendment that is unequivocally safe from any partisan challenge is the rd since the US doesn t mind spending money on military bases both at home and abroad 
PoliticalDiscussion,The progressives will not come out for Biden  Unless Biden gives in to every single one of their demand they are going to either not come out or do some stupid protest vote Bernie Sanders endorsing Biden won t do shit  Votebluenomatterwho only mattered to them when Sanders was considered the front runner 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be nice to think the GOP wouldn t attack the patriotism of a Democratic candidate who lost limbs serving in uniform but they ve already done precisely that successfully  Max Cleland was a Democratic Senator and a triple amputee Vietnam Veteran who lost re election in  because Bush who spent the war in the Texas Air National Guard attacked him for being insufficiently patriotic for opposing the authorization for the invasion of Iraq  There is no moral bottom for people who are at this point still capable of voting Republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah the NPVIC seems like a pretty simple way to implement such a system though the constitutionality of it might be questionable Sadly I don t anticipate that the Electoral College will go away so long as one party benefits from it much more than the other 
PoliticalDiscussion,He will pick a woman Who knows who But what I really don t understand  aside from people just wanting him to pick the man they want is why so many people assume Biden doesn t need to pick a woman or woman of color because he already has that  locked down  Democrats absolutely need the continued support of women and people of color who are the true Democratic base Wouldn t it be more valuable to activate the Obama coalition of suburban women and people of color who pushed him to victory twice than to lean on a safe white male policy wonk There s no argument that there aren t any qualified women  There are plenty So the argument that he should be picking the  best qualified candidate doesn t rule them out Or are people just afraid that picking a woman would somehow push bigoted and sexist white working class men to Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Gretchen Whitmer would be a great pick Not a female but I wonder if Tony Evers would be a good pick It should be noted that one of the perks of having Paul Ryan as the VP in  was that Wisconsin was supposed to be competitive and that state was called not long after the polls closed 
PoliticalDiscussion, Article     I ll start with this psychology today article it provides a good summary of the available info and includes references to several studies and reviews 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the only Republican that could possibly lose in Kansas is Kobach  That s why so many are trying to make sure he doesn t end up as a Senate candidate  The GOP doesn t want a repeat of the lady Kansas gubernatorial election
PoliticalDiscussion,Illinois elected a Republican senator in  To just assume that California will be safe is making the same mistake the republicans did with Alabama A lot can happen The democratic nominee could get indicted for kiddie porn a week before the election We don t know 
PoliticalDiscussion,There will always be some because of how we live but computer generated and independently drawn districts can greatly increase the number of competitive districts This can be done in many states with ballot initiatives 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is why he needs to speak about why he adopted the platform or else it seems that he is just trying to court voters I frankly do not know if Biden is genuine about free college If he told me in his own words why he adopted the platform and why he did it now then I would be more confident that he will get it done I do think Biden s reputation has been skewed to make him seem more conservative than he is but to be frank he does have a bit of flip flopping in his past so it has been easy for people to criticize him I will obviously support him in November though 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt have literally never changed  Counterexample Blaine vs Cleveland came down to New York   gt Why are you for this Orwellian Madness  Lulz  Trans women are women Diversity is our strength    That s Orwellian madness 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt how the democratic party was blocking the emergency stimulus bill for non emergency partisan aligned fluff  Partisan aligned fluff like the fact that the GOP bill ignored American workers in favor of throwing billions into a slush fund for Trump to use in secrecy at his discretion    gt etc to shut down dialog and bury truths that benefit the right and Trump  Trump s a liar and all you have are  alternative facts  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why wouldn t a woman unite the party The party where women make up the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,I had this exact conversation with one of my brain dead aunts  she actually thinks that her vote wouldnt matter in a national popular vote system despite her living in a state that allocates all electoral votes to the winner  which isn t her party  Her vote literally means nothing because of the electoral college but she only listens to what fox news and her conservative husband says so there s no convincing her otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,I fully agree with that but I believe it would be much harder to fix the gerrymandering issue because there aren t set lines that can be deemed as fair depending on demographics saved for certain minority groups With the electoral college we can fix that by just not having it but the way our congress works we need congressional districts 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s probably part of why there s a movement to get enough states to adopt the popular vote rule  It s easier to convince all  electoral college votes worth of states  minimum  I think  to change their voting systems than to convince everyone to change their voting systems even if you re convincing  to switch to an extreme vs  to switch to a more moderate view like proportional voting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I think I see what you mean I believe u NoMoreGhostVotes is bringing up voter turnout percentages because it isn t just having an electoral college  EC that s an issue but rather it is one issue another being voter turnout   You d be correct in that low voter turnout is NOT an argument for keeping the EC but rather another problem that we need to address 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gerrymandering is an even bigger issue If you have a competitive house seat it increases turnout 
PoliticalDiscussion,If anything TN has been trending even more red not more blue We had a popular former two term Democrat governor who was able to win every single county in the state in his re election campaign run against a Trump Republican for a seat in the senate and he got blown out pretty hard White southerners REALLY hate Democrats right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida is a saturated market for political parties Routinely posts  gt   turnout during Presidential elections Less likely to deviate from the priors more  swing proof  if that makes any sense to you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Again the swing states have literally never changed It s always Ohio and Florida Every state only votes the same because the Electors don t listen to the people Why are you for this Orwellian Madness 
PoliticalDiscussion,If so then it s time for an amendment The US Constitution is meant to be a living document 
PoliticalDiscussion,Different states have different laws and receive different amounts of money from the US Government so they vote as a unit of sorts 
PoliticalDiscussion,You mean how it is now 
PoliticalDiscussion,And then two and a half centuries of history happened rendering all of that irrelevant 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you can link the studies I d welcome it Everything I ve seen shows people are pretty locked into their views by their late s early s 
PoliticalDiscussion,And that works fine for state elections For electing a national leader why would we ever segregate ourselves in that manner It made a slight amount of sense when communication wasn t instantaneous now it makes none 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao you re a master of persuasion  Again the swing states change The Democrats aren t even trying in Ohio because our population in cities doesn t overpower the rest of the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas feels like the White Whale that everyone says will go blue but never does Beto s loss there in  makes me pretty bearish on Hegar s chances against Cornyn and the chance of the state flipping I think demographic numbers still have a ways to go before we get there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those states literally didn t matter in  
PoliticalDiscussion,See point  on my initial post I am against all electoral college votes of a state going to a single candidate I think it s the biggest problem of our existing system 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not quite there have actually been a number of studies showing that ppl as they age tend to shift positions to more conservative views Not because the country becomes more progressive but rather because their perspective shifts Taxing the rich is easy when you re a broke college student less so when if you become a six figure earner 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How would you solve the problem of voter turnout disparities amongst the states  Having a popular vote would help   Those leaning towards Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California would be more likely to turn out likewise more people might vote for the majority party in a safe non swing state if they have more perception of that vote mattering For example I didn t vote in the midterms for my Congressman  who I support  because he s D  I m not that motivated to vote D in CA because it s going D already  It removes a bit of that  well this state just goes red blue anyway    The other part of that is education and getting people to believe that they have a stake and that politics affects them 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s pretty interesting Are there any real world examples to look at 
PoliticalDiscussion,lol no Senate majority leaded wields near unilateral authority over Senate procedure and floor votes Biden helped whip votes and navigate congress but he still played second fiddle to Reid 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s point  on my original list  I want proportionality of votes on the electoral college per state 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Senate is the Legislative branch s part of State powers  The Judicial system is elected with help of the Senate  The electoral college could be considered as a way to bring states into the executive branch but also people into the executive branch The US could have been founded where state governments elect the president not the people just as easily  Have you seen CGP Gray s video on the electoral college 
PoliticalDiscussion, You don t know the Electoral College then  Again Electoral College  What part of  Electoral College never helps anyone but Ohio and Florida did you intentionally miss 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here in Michigan things seem relatively good for Democrats I think Whitmer is relatively well received but I think the entire picture of this year s election depends on how bad the pandemic hits us   If it s earth shatteringly bad and every city in America runs out of ICU beds morgue space and every extended family loses at least one person then I can t see it going super well for Trump   His base are immune to facts of any kind though and the main talking point is almost certainly going to be  Hillary would have done a worse job  
PoliticalDiscussion,Wisconsin I can see going red as Madison Milwaukee just aren t big enough to stave off the rural areas getting more Republican but Philly and Pittsburgh plus their bluing suburbs are big enough to offset any further gains the GOP get in PA s rural areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Automatic voter registration and mail in voting in every state
PoliticalDiscussion,The Senate is there to balance States rights   The electoral college currently just swings the Presidency towards empty land rather than voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,A founding tenant of the United States is that we are states united That is a collection of sovereign regions that collectively share resources and many other things  The federal government s intended job is the management of commerce between the states among other things Almost every law at a federal level  has to prove itself to be related to the commerce clause or to the military which is arguably also under the commerce clause since weapons protect our ability to trade  State powers is in the very base of the US s design
PoliticalDiscussion,As a Californian I wouldn t support  electoral vote per person That would swing the balance too hard in the direction of big states and just be trading one set of problems for another equally bad set of problems  I want to see  person  vote with no electoral college for presidential races If  of the states population votes for one candidate and  vote for another then then each candidate should get all of those votes  In the end the candidate that could convince the most people to vote for them wins regardless of which state those votes came from 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s still a Senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow  That is insanely rough  I feel for you  And I d be tearing my hair out in your shoes  Don t worry  I have faith sadly that this will hit hard enough to actually hurt him  It will be as real for many of his supporters as it is for you  Although I wouldn t wish that on anyone  And when it does hit them the comments will be doubly painful to them because there put so much faith in him 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt ppl are proven to become more conservative as they age  I don t think there is any proof for that What happens is people stay the same politically for most their lives but the nation around them continues to move more left or right So what was a moderate liberal in the s is more similar to a conservative these days especially on social issues 
PoliticalDiscussion,You wouldn t have to go to any state since in a popular vote system states don t vote anymore   Under the electoral college states vote Under the popular vote people vote  You would have to go to where the people are because people would actually matter again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wyoming already basically has no say in a national election Nobody has campaigned seriously there in decades if ever Why would we care more about what a majority of people in a state want than what a majority of voters want in a national election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I imagine a Biden loss would lead to a massive backlash from progressive voters The  primaries had a huge crop of young progressive challengers looking to sweep away the old guard and a  still under Trump would probably result in even more establishment figures being primaried   The general attitude among a lot of progressives is that many Dems have been completely ineffectual at countering Trump and I imagine that mentality would increase tenfold if they lose to him again 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only thing Georgia needs to turned blue is a fair election and turnout No voter purges No Secretary of State running his own election No  exact match nonsense Just voters getting off their asses going to the polls and voting their conscience If we can just get that Georgia will be blue Or at least purple like it was when I moved here in  
PoliticalDiscussion,While I would generally agree with you technological change  globalism has led to the boom of metropolitan areas and their attached suburban areas at the expense areas built on old industry The whole reason why the Atlantic region sun belt is trending blue is because of the growth in the major cities in those areas This also explains  IMO why states like Wisconsin and Michigan have been trending redder This is certainly a plausible explanation for why Ohio is red 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I also think he should do a better job advertising how he has adopted some of Bernie and Warrens platforms  The front page has a post about that rape story Yeah it s from the early s and was discredited   Those Bernie supporters wouldn t have voted for Biden under any circumstances   I m not sure what else to do Bernie started this fire he convinced these people that he is their only hope   For as much as he says it s about his policies his supporters don t seem to care 
PoliticalDiscussion,What were the margins in those races   The house delegation is split  GOP  Dem  It leans red for sure but in no way a deep red state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not enough information For all we know the political landscape could be completely different in the very near future
PoliticalDiscussion,In the last  years one Senate seat has been occupied by a democrat for  years one Senate seat has been held by a democrat for  years That s over  democrat  In the last  years the governor has been Republican for all    In the last  years they have selected a Democrat president for  of them  This is about as borderline  leans red    purple you can get 
PoliticalDiscussion,The senate and governor race were won by literally    not much more swingy than that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think PA would The only areas of the state that are growing are the blue areas  Philly Pittsburgh and the Lehigh Valley I mean yeah it went red for Trump but long term I see it going more blue In  the democratic governor won overwhelmingly 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say Arizona is already there Georgia is close and Texas in a decade 
PoliticalDiscussion,This pick needs to be designed to do ONE thing and ONE thing only Get dems to the polls who might not vote in the general election  Let s say that Obama was a fluke and the main reason why trump won  A woman VP pick is the wrong move Joe Get someone who will UNITE the  party not  Hillary DIVIDE the party  I am thinking the top Dem from a southern state Georgia Florida I am thinking Bill Nelson  In the U S Senate he was generally considered a centrist and a  moderate Democrat   cite note          cite note          cite note          cite note  Nelson supported  same sex marriage   cite note    lowering taxes on lower and middle income families         cite note    expanding environmental programs and regulation         cite note    protecting the  Affordable Care Act   cite note    and expanding  Medicaid   cite note     From Wikipedia
PoliticalDiscussion,When there s ranked choice the EC will go Maybe not that decade but whatever groups take control of the house they ll look to the presidency and say  I want that and look into making the changes 
PoliticalDiscussion, Show me your evidence then You made the claim the burden of proof is on you  You lost by fucking up your own math Let s make it look like it has the Electoral College rules on it  vote vote for Potter  vote for Edward the rest refuse to vote because it doesn t matter and the head guy says we re ruled by Team Pink Guy now because he s an elector That s the system I am protesting That is the Electoral College  Not enough bring your entire party bus or you forfeit  ad is not a campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,It keeps going up another poll today
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio and Florida 
PoliticalDiscussion, Which  are you referring to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Everyone keeps mentioning Beto s loss as a negative its absolutely not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good Make the baby boomers pay for the economy they keep voting in Young people should be buying at small shops and from smaller people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Both seem nearly impossible this would require an amendment wouldn t it Ranked choice voting is terrible for the established entities in power  both parties and abolishing the EC is terrible for the GOP As much as these would be good things for the country how could we possibly pass either one 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Your last sentence  It s not  almost  It is exactly that Village mentality 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just a personal anecdote but I have younger adult family members that usually get a morning coffee from starbucks dunkin and work lunch takeout notice how small their credit card bill is I definitely think there will be some people that keep the cutbacks after  OTOH the Baby Boomer generation is going to buy takeout for awhile once this pandemic has passed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t it insane that a guy who s inappropriate with children and  allegedly sexually assaulted someone is  back to normalcy  
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas could very possibly become a purple or blue state in that time frame and if it does it s the only one that matters Unless the GOP is content being relegated to obstructing legislation this would kill the party 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that if current trends continue we could see Minnesota becoming more of a purple swing state in future elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Montana is a state to watch It has a Democratic governor and senator and has a growing population Housing prices are cheap the natural scenery appeals to young professionals and it has a robust state university system   California is due for a political realignment but I don t think it will be as simple as going from blue to red California has massive income inequality has a history of mismanaging its budget and has one of the worst homelessness crises in the country Unchallenged party control doesn t typically survive these circumstances unscathed However the Republican brand is toxic in the Trump era and the jungle primary system makes it harder for GOP to field token opposition to build on their brand I think there is room for an existing third party to make inroads in local offices in California or for a new party to split off from the Democrats but this would require a massive amount of political organizing Perhaps one of the tech billionaires can pull it off  This is also heresy but I don t think New York is as solidly Democratic as people think I live in upstate New York and I ve been to NYC many times It s not nearly as progressive as it s portrayed in the media Social liberals and culture elites have a huge national megaphone but there are plenty of rural and working class folks who aren t happy with their government New York doesn t like to think of itself as  prim and proper like say Virginia and Massachusetts and this could work against the Democrats if they further solidify themselves as the party of college educated professionals Like California there is a lot of income inequality and there are serious issues regarding housing The Democrats have a very strong party organization in this state but once Trump is no longer president there could be room for the GOP to rebrand itself and win elections particularly if there s a Democratic President 
PoliticalDiscussion,We passed Italy already Go back and check the numbers Have they changed Naw didn t think so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anadotal but I was raised in San Diego I could never afford to actually buy a house here in the city I was raised And I make good money as a Software Engineer That being said everyone I know moved up to Oregon That seems like the place to go 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ding ding And who knows this The guy holding up the purchase of ventilators that s who 
PoliticalDiscussion,In  you had a bunch of  independents or  never trumpers who when in the little booth smiled and voted for the bastard Now with everything in the news what percentage of voters who PLAN on voting for trump who fucking LOVE trump will not admit it publicly anymore Yeah the percentage of people when asked in a poll if they still support him and they say  no  One of the ONLY true things trump EVER SAID was that he could shoot someone on th avenue and people would STILL vote for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we go back to our normal lives  well if EVERYONE ELSE but the smart people go back to their normal lives we will have near  spread of the desease by October Those are the numbers It is math It is fact  This means up to  million dead over half of whom would have survived if they had listened to the governors of blue states and just stayed home What is truly sad is that trump will probably win every red state he won in  because the people who are left will STILL vote for him  I am telling everyone    stay the fuck home Your job is not worth your life or the lives of your parents The country will bounce back as long as you are still alive to VOTE in November 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you re right about Kansas probably going for Trump but by a smaller margin then in  I also think Kansas has a shot at electing a Dem senator if Kobach is the GOP nominee
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah it s by far the most important change in fact I would prefer distributing electors proportionally over a raw popular vote only because each state running their elections differently makes popular vote somewhat easy to abuse  would need to switch to federally run elections for federal positions for this to work  ex if a state is majority party A and party A also controls the state government doing stuff like automatic vote by mail and whatnot to increase turnout increases the popular vote for the A candidate overall  or more sinisterly fudging the number of reported votes while keeping the proportion the same would be much harder to detect an anomaly here with exit polls  if a state is majority party A but has a party B state government they can suppress their states vote uniformly  no need to target specific communities just reduce the total number of votes to hurt the A candidate in national elections  so either run the presidential election federally  which I believe would require a constitutional amendment or switch states over to proportional allocation of electors  which would require cooperation between the states but not necessarily an amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our economic system is inherently precarious wrt the individual Stop blaming individual behavior for something caused by a systemic problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Nelson lost  in Florida  Please All the fucking assholes who came out to vote against hillary got rick scott into office by just moving down  inch on the ballot and making a checkmark in the same column   Kamala will not help Biden Neither will Warren or any of the other women who were in the race What woman would actually help Biden s campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kentucky may be purple Andy Beshear is a Democrat a popular governor who s getting really high approvals right now and the first thing he did after getting sworn in was re enfranchise felons who ve served their time and that s a group that s disproportionately black and Democratic I still don t think it s winnable for a Democrat presidential candidate but it s getting close 
PoliticalDiscussion,You realize Hillary lost mainly because she was a woman right Let s not get all high and mighty about the democratic voters in this country They are only slightly better as a group than the republicans This primary should be telling you volumes Why do you think Bernie is doing so poorly this time around It is not because Biden is so much better than him    he is actually worse in many ways  it is because Bernie isn t running against Hillary I voted for Hillary I voted for her in the primary vs Obama and vs Bernie Fuck I donated to her campaign But I know lots and lots of people who could just not pull the lever for her Because she has no penis And yeah they were and are democrats Stupid misguided and horrible democrats but still democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigan might not even go red in  at the Presidential level if the Democrats hit Trump hard  and they will about him delaying federal aid to the state because he s upset the governor criticized the poor federal response     I imagine it ll be close either way but things like this aren t going to help him in November It makes him look petty cruel and heartless and the victims are the people voting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Much thanks I ll give it a read when I have the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida is a swing state for Presidential elections and is red for state elections It s been like this for  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas is slowly turning blue due to people in the cities and people seeing through the bs of certain Republican politicians
PoliticalDiscussion,Coal is dead The clean up make will make many regions attractive for urabn growith and business location 
PoliticalDiscussion,That was point  on my suggested changes and I think  is the most important one by far
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas will turn blue soon but Florida might go red 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trees water Land Proximity to East Coast for businesses Murfreesboro is expanding fast 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt At the limits  electoral college vote per person is the popular vote  not if its winner take all
PoliticalDiscussion,I know but I was more getting at how I think it would be easier to pass since Republicans are going to be staunchly against using popular vote and are unlikely to sign it into effect but it may be easier to pass ranked choice voting which is still an improvement 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If Brownback could ve run for another term I think he would have won  Maybe there were signs that he just wasn t very popular at the end At one point he held the title probably not desirable of least favorite governor in America with a  approval rating That was after he veto blocked a tax increase congress wanted He also was losing friends in congress to primaries  republcians being primaried from the left is probably not a good sign and general elections  not as much but still had his veto   Assuming he didn t swivel I could see him winning by a narrow thin line but it be tough fought battle and probably still hard to win Of course if he d had to win he might have done things way different Its easy to be a rock in the road when your future is based on being a rock Its harder when your future depends more on not having the rock disposal team called out on you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Literally all corporations are set up this way company policy is set up by votes made by shares in a company and you can give your vote to someone else Of course with companies you can buy multiple shares and therefore have multiple votes but with a country you would only get one share per person 
PoliticalDiscussion,One left field answer I could think of would be Alaska which has a growing Native population on track to make up a plurality of eligible voters by the mid s and a majority by the s Similar growth among Natives and Hispanics in Oklahoma could make it a competitive state sometime mid century if the current electoral coalitions hold  Source  
PoliticalDiscussion,Even some normally Republican districts in Michigan went blue in  The ones Stevens and Slotkin won  Michigan has always been a blue leaning swing state and I think that hasn t changed in my anecdotal experience Just Hillary did an especially bad job campaigning or marketing to Michigan meanwhile Trump s focus on trade and taking on NAFTA helped him win over enough working class people to take the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I never said anything against Obama but you re pretty hung up on that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Our Gov just today said that we will run out of ventilators next week NY state has thousands at the ready  NY State is running out of them too Blame Trump he s the one that was boasting about outbidding the States for ventilators    gt Do you think Cuomo could spare a couple hundred Hell no He is a hoarder  He s the Governor of a State that needs those ventilators   China gave  ventilators and loaned  Doctors to Italy You think that they ll do anything to help a Nationalist President that s trying to generate racism towards them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fiscally there s maybe a small shift but socially no  Nobody says  Well I was a okay with gay people having rights when I was in my twenties but now that I have a well paying job I ve decided to hate them   And the Republican party has hung their identity on divisive social issues namely abortion guns and white nationalism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting you bring up Rhode Island because I was literally just going to ask if anyone in the comments knew about them  As you said they swung hard for Trump in   only WV IA ME and ND swung harder right  best any Republican has done there since Reagan RI has a lot of blue collar white Catholics  an increasingly pro Republican demographic  Combine that with  from what I ve heard them having an unpopular Dem governor and I think it be interesting to see if they become another West Virginia like state Granite there fast growing Latino population in Providence makes it unlikely but still its an interesting discussion   And to your last point Trump did very well in New England he improved on Romney s performance in all but  of New Englands counties outside of Massachusetts Don t think New England will be trending red anytime soon but with the rural industrial decline in many areas of it in places like Maine and Rhode Island they certainly could become more competitive in the future 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey I never said we d win elections I don t think Bernie would win v Trump either As much as it sucks to say I think we re a little too early for the true progressive leftist wave that I wish would happen I think it will happen in   In fact I work with the local DNC from time to time and push for the candidates and policies I want there because feasibly it gets something done rather than posting epic clapbacks on twitter so all my leftie friends can know I m above it all  Well that was all before coronavirus struck at least I d be as foolish as anyone to try to predict what s gonna happen now  Regard courting us the fact is that the DNC does need progressives to a certain extent For a long time we weren t courted in part because we were a guaranteed lock to vote for them You base constituency doesn t need the bulk of your time they ve already made their choice It s just over the last  years they ve cared less and less about progressive values with a small blip during Obama s campaign and let the base rot You can only sit there and be ignored for so long before you go fuck it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t really see progressives being much of a force in the coming years without bernie to lead them They didn t come out to vote this primary They alienated the rest of the Democratic Party They re gonna need to sit and stew a couple years and learn to coalition build before they re ready to come at the party again imo But the conversation will definitely be ongoing between moderates and progressives I just don t think there will be someone as big a threat as Bernie for a while 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Brownback could ve run for another term I think he would have won  Kobach is a magical mix of Brownback s terrible economic policy Trump s incredible incompetence and overt racism on top of having less charisma than Hillary Clinton  Kobach is special in his ability to be terrible
PoliticalDiscussion,It s sort of disingenuous to call a public option a compromise position when that s the most popular position according to polls 
PoliticalDiscussion,Similarly lots of people have been leaving New York to move down to Florida
PoliticalDiscussion,The governor race was mind bogglingly close DeSantis only beat Gillum by    it was so close that it triggered an automatic recount at the end of the first counting I wouldn t count that as soldily red
PoliticalDiscussion, gt yet the left thought it wouldn t make a difference if Trump was the one that filled it   gt I think a whole lot of folks like to characterize what Sanders supporters would do and that when y all do it we Sanders supporters typically respond with  wat  
PoliticalDiscussion,What West Virginia Kentucky and Tennessee becoming blue states 
PoliticalDiscussion,glad to hear it Our Gov just today said that we will run out of ventilators next week NY state has thousands at the ready Do you think Cuomo could spare a couple hundred Hell no He is a hoarder That is where we are at today no head in sand just depending on modern science and staying positive You should try it Stay safe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ranked choice on individual ballots combined with winner takes all state votes in an electoral college still fucks things up and has the same two parties or lose problem of winner takes all elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,I could see Texas being a swing state by    Don t get me wrong I m not delusional about it I don t think it will happen until after Trump   I could see Michigan going back to blue in this election If you put any generic democrat on the ticket they win my state just really really hated Hillary Clinton  for some reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah while the above poster is definitely not right about Michigan specifically his thesis might hold for the greater Midwest Ohio Minnesota Nebraska and Iowa  Pennsylvania is interesting because it is simultaneously a Midwest state in the western parts and a  East Coast state with a major metropolis in Philadelphia
PoliticalDiscussion,But there is no presidential election in   I mean it should be       Right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Assuming that there isn t a shift in parties and coalitions  I think by then Texas and Georgia will be swing states if not leaning blue There ll be too many minorities and white liberal transplants in metro Dallas Houston Atlanta for the rural white conservative vote to swamp the cities   Florida will continue to swing Older folks are going down there to retire and there s enough conservative suburban and small town white vote there even if there s a general trend of the South being more friendly to Democrats  Maine might start to lean more Republican It is an old rural state and Trump won the st Congressional District by over  points Obama won it by  points in  Portland keeps Maine blue but I wonder if that is going to be possible in the future  Ohio I think is going red The white working class voters that kept the Democrats competitive have gone red The cities are not enough to balance this out   South Carolina MAY be more competitive if Charleston continues to grow and it attracts more younger liberal transplants Maybe the combined votes of African Americans and more liberal transplant can make the state competitive But this is a big maybe  One wildcard I d through out there is Rhode Island There was a big swing to Trump there Trump improved on Romney there by about  points Trump won a county many towns and precincts that last voted Republican for Bush Sr There s a lot of white working class voters there and if the Republicans continue to be the supposed champion of white blue collar America Rhode Island could swing right Trump actually did surprisingly well in a lot of rural New England in general 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m of those people who thinks Sanders supporters are not needed in the general  primarily because I don t think they vote in high enough numbers  but I also don t think he can be credited for the  loss for the same reason  Like him or not Bernie voters for whatever reason don t seem to be motivated to vote in general even for him    He got so much traction in  because Hilary was really that poor of a candidate  If we had another Obama or even if Biden had run in  then I really feel like Bernie would have had the same low turnout he s getting now and probably would have had about as much influence as Dennis Kucinich did

PoliticalDiscussion,I m unsure about that actually it definitely hurt but I m convinced that a lot of his supporters go to the rally s and make a lot of noise on Twitter but aren t even registered to vote   It boggles my mind that their was an open seat on the US Supreme Court and Sanders ran his entire campaign on overturning the citizens united Supreme Court ruling and yet the left thought it wouldn t make a difference if Trump was the one that filled it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please include a link to a news article from a reputable source for this  u InDreams   Thanks  lt  I d reccomend either      or    
PoliticalDiscussion,The data doesn t back that up The three largest counties in South Florida routinely give   of its votes to the Democratic candidates 
PoliticalDiscussion,You find it hard to believe that California literally gets  electors and Alabama gets     xB   
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump but if Clinton had won Wisconsin Pennslyvania and Michigan she would have won the whole election without Florida and Ohio Ohio was more Republican than Arizona and Georgia in  it s no longer a swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion,The obvious answer is that Texas and Georgia will be standard swing States in the  s while Ohio and Wisconsin become solid red States   This question is fun because it is looking for oddities like West Virginia going from solid blue to solid red the South abandoning Democrats like it did from  and states like Missouri switching from a reliable swing state into a solid red state while Colorado and Virginia are making opposite changes   With that in mind I also don t like the concept of transplants changing states because I believe transplants are more likely to be the opposite of the place they came from I am going to keep pointing this out but Beto won the Native Texan vote   I am curious about Idaho and Montana s trajectory Missoula is plainly a blue city attracting blue residents like Austin and Asheville before it and given the small population of the state it could cause the state to become less predictable in  years I don t know if Boise is quite as blue but it could do the same to Idaho   As for larger states I discussed elsewhere that Tennessee could change though it s suburbs  and by extension the ones that spill into Mississippi seem unusually stubborn compared to other suburbs around the country I am not betting on it but it could happen in the distant future We are currently very very red Growth in Nashville is key to this though I do wonder if people moving to Nashville are generally more conservative than your average city dweller It is a cultural center of conservative America   Also look for states with a growing minority population That is likely shifting Texas   Arizona and Colorado more than the transplants I can t think of a good state to use as an example but if Kansas  or heck even Alabama in the right circumstances ever flipped this would be why Keep an eye on the Latino population in a state if you want to see if it could flip 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean the alternative is Donald Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I find that hard to believe since California is seen as a flyover state Why is California epicenter of all American Technology and Media treated like a used napkin 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the window really hasn t shifted as much as you think it has It s shifted on reddit and with young people but not with voters  If you ve seen any polling or research otherwise I d love to see it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Show me your evidence then You made the claim the burden of proof is on you  You made the claim that every state is purple if you get  voter turnout Show us the evidence the burden of proof is on you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who won those states 
PoliticalDiscussion,She wasn t anti war she was anti  pointless wars  
PoliticalDiscussion,California gets more electoral points than Alabama right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the left is not going to vote for Biden no matter what Those are low propensity voters anyway He s going to need to make it up with high propensity suburban voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is that a loaded our rhetorical question I m literally asking why people are saying Covid proves single payer is better   
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like there s almost an unwritten agreement between the more progressive Democrats and the centrist wing The progressives have previously reluctantly accepted that they may be too far left to win a national election and accept a moderate Democrat just to keep out the Republicans and get some progressive policy in  I think though that this is changing progressives are a lot more energized now and they don t see themselves as a fringe in the party anymore The agreement that I mentioned probably started to fray when Hillary lost to Trump Hillary was the moderate choice compared to Bernie and she lost I d be beyond rich if I got a dollar for everytime I heard from my more progressive friends  Bernie would have beaten Trump  The progressives believe that their progressive policy  and candidates can win in a general election I personally am not yet convinced  Even in this campaign we re hearing both that Bernie will beat Trump and also that Bernie is going to lose moderates and suburbanites and that Biden can win moderate Republicans and swing voters   If Biden doesn t win well that is twice that the more moderate wing has failed The progressives will start saying that it is their turn to face the Republicans I agree we ll see establishment Democrats being primaried in  if Trump is still President Progressives seem to think that Pelosi Schumer and co are just useless 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Nelson lost in  during a blue wave He s done 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you want the DNC to court you then start winning elections I keep hearing about how progressives democrats can win in massive landslides in deep red states and the numbers never add up I like Richard Ojeda but he lost 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would rural voters think their votes don t matter on a popular vote system You lack basic math skills 
PoliticalDiscussion,Huh Why would one vote in rural America matter less than one vote in NYC  The issue may be that candidates won t push agendas for rural America as much 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just for the record NC is already a swing state It leans red compared to some of the others but has a Democratic governor and voted for Obama in  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Strasser brothers and their followers were not socialists  far from it  they were practically neo feudalists   Goal was quasi rewinding the changes in mode of production and emergence of the proletariat brought about by the industrial revolution through restructuring society to include a peasant farmer caste tied to hereditary land holdings a craftsman caste organized like the medieval guild system and a  functional aristocracy manager caste drawn from the petite bourgeois  conveniently the same class background as the Strassers and many of the Nazi Party s leadership    The surviving Strasser brother later got big into creating a proto European Union of sorts same as the British Union of Fascists Oswald Mosley and tried to get the Allies to install him as puppet ruler of Germany after the war ended 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would expect most states outside of the Deep South that are red to turn purple due to shifting demographics the politics of millions Le and gen Y along with the age of the conservative base Of course having tons of federally appointment judges under Trump could keep many states red due to the current means of suppressing voting and gerrymandering that tends to be upheld by conservative judges barring any legislation that clarifies these rules or makes these activities explicitly illegal 
PoliticalDiscussion,All I will say about Tennessee is if Nashville keeps growing like it is it might become competitive again in the  s However I am going to need to see Hamilton county vote blue and Democrats having a pulse in Germantown and Williamson County for me to believe the change is actually going to happen 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  In  years when half the boomers silent are dead and the  year olds are  the  year olds are   today s blue  year old s will become red by the time they re  everybody turns more conservative when they get older and start paying heavier taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes proportionately allocating votes would be great but I still think states like Kansas get a disproportionately high amount of representation since their electoral votes matter more than those of say California s These states already get an undeserved amount of influence in the running of the country through the Senate 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt As an aside I wonder what form of food or beverage will be blamed for the climate catastrophes  meat already is
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think Trump has a prayer of taking Michigan Hillary was uniquely weak in that region and it was generally overlooked by pretty much everyone Biden is much more popular in the rust belt  He won the Michigan primary for one thing which Hillary lost in  and he s undoubtedly going to do a lot more campaigning and a lot more internal polling in the rust belt It s not going to be overlooked this time and without that Trump is is trouble 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you think his gun control comments may have ruined the reputation of the Democrats in Texas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio is getting progressively redder Texas is getting progressively bluer The question is Which one is moving faster 
PoliticalDiscussion,NC will definitely be a swing state or a long time  Here in NC a lot of hispanics growing up here a lot of NYers moving down here etc however a lot of younger stereotypically  red people growing up in the suburbs 
PoliticalDiscussion,i don t see any reason to pick gabbard she doesn t bring anything but infighting because she s  republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,she d be great not sure if she s eligible though she s what the democrats would need to just chew up trump in the media
PoliticalDiscussion,Listen to yourself NY should keep ventilators in stock for the future while people in the most infected city per capita has NONE They most likely would be able to get more before they went through all  Cuomo is a HOARDER much less a WHINER How many hospitals does he need before he thanks the taxpayer for them INGRATE You sound like you could care less about people Thank China for the WuFlu 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree and I will say they will probably be pretty solidly red until      gt  and both have the city lines issues that make you think someone in ecstasy drew them   As a Missourian this got a huge laugh out of me 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree however I think there will be a shifting surge by the mid  s The suburbs are red now but I think come November they will be less red not necessarily blue but a more distinct split There s also the St Louis and St Louis county stuff so we ll see some new data regarding demographics there   Also I ask people to pay attention to Jasper County  my current county and Greene County over the next decade Both are  very red right now but are home to  quickly expanding universities I will say I am somewhat connected to people who work in both parties and it s been an interesting year in Missouri 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maine and New Hampshire are considered swing states as well What I meant was more that those states tend to become competitive only when there is a huge win for the other party rather than in a normal competitive election My prediction was more about them becoming competitive during a normal close election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you As a Georgia resident who moved here a few years ago the Atlanta metro area and  burbs are absolutely pristine ground for modern democrats winning elections through strong performances with minorities and suburban women 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will be incredibly fascinating if as Nate Silver has speculated we ll reach a time in the late s when the south  specifically VA NC and GA is more reliably blue than the Midwest  OH WI IA  
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand this but abortion isn t murder A fetus isn t a person   What do you think it would take to get through to these people It wasn t that long ago that abortion was a non issue  evangelicals just didn t get abortions they didn t support stopping people everywhere from getting them   What will it take to get us out of this nightmare where religious fanatics decide what is and isn t truth while we utterly ignore doctors and scientists who are most capable of actually determining that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand this but abortion isn t murder A fetus isn t a person   What do you think it would take to get through to these people It wasn t that long ago that abortion was a non issue  evangelicals just didn t get abortions they didn t support stopping people everywhere from getting them   What will it take to get us out of this nightmare where religious fanatics decide what is and isn t truth while we utterly ignore doctors and scientists who are most capable of actually determining that 
PoliticalDiscussion,china
PoliticalDiscussion,Not true at all it s been trending very very red as of late By  it ll be alabama 
PoliticalDiscussion,I want to point out to anybody reading this thread that arguments aren t to be downvoted because you disagree with them but because it s a bad argument This is a really good argument that doesn t deserve to be downvoted 
PoliticalDiscussion,The reason it isn t already blue is because Texas is gerrymandered to shit
PoliticalDiscussion,You d think Massachusetts and Alabama would be safe seats for their respective parties and they both flipped so I wouldn t want to take a chance under any circumstances 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Gretchen Whitmer would help Biden Maybe Stacy Abrams  And Nelson lost by a small margin but he lost 
PoliticalDiscussion,By  the United States we know today will no longer exist It s already dissolving 
PoliticalDiscussion,Women came out in force to vote for trump in  because he was running against   
PoliticalDiscussion,That s bullshit If you watched the debates in  it was obvious that the party has moved to the left of where they were in  and  I m leaving out  because there were barely any candidates  And the majority of Sanders voters are under the age of  and not even around in  and  
PoliticalDiscussion,New York isn t turning red anytime The city is nearly a majority on its own and the metro area in the state is a significant majority The NY metro area is fundamentally liberal and unless the GOP manages to run to the left of the Democratic Party they re not going to turn it 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Sanders supporters were really worried about that seat the way evangelicals were worried about it I think the results would have been different 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bay Area resident here albeit on the fringes where you see some more Trump supporters Like you said you would need a socially liberal Republican like Schwarzenegger Looking back at the past few gubernatorial elections none of Republicans who ran were exciting at all It will be very hard for Republicans to win at all Republicans shot themselves in the foot with  and then tried to win a foot race Demographics don t help them either Unless a Republican comes along who is really socially liberal I doubt they win any state wide elections Maybe flip some State Senate seats or State Assembly seats looking at the map even that will be difficult 
PoliticalDiscussion,How does that help smaller states 
PoliticalDiscussion,At that point California and the northeast will be devoid of people due to the coronavirus plague that wiped out large swaths of the population from  to  There will be many new settlers who will vote republican so I would expect those states to be in play for republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,     Sure I m talking about Kentucky though Did that happen in the KY Gov race 
PoliticalDiscussion,My guess is the Northeast Positive State comprised of citizens permanently communicative of COVID     I don t mean to be flippant but wanted to emphasize that it s very possible that COVID will alter our entire society in ways that are difficult to foresee 
PoliticalDiscussion,    I think the difference in these elections is that elderly people have the highest turnout and the Republicans have a lot of enthusiasm among the elderly  This is why the blue wave missed Florida it was just a game of turnout  Also the Florida Democratic party is a bit of an uneasy coalition between socially liberal semi affluent white people and working class more socially conservative black people  It takes a very skilled coalition builder like Obama to win the state for a Democrat  Though I wouldn t call Florida deep red like Tennessee Nebraska or Oklahoma are 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am not sure 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think none of the traditional math holds up anymore for one simple reason if Americans get checks in the mail  or any other kind of direct financial assistance during the COVID quarantines lockdowns whatever regardless of which party is responsible for it Trump is going to beat his opponents handily  There will be a concerted effort to make sure they re known as  the Trump Checks  and low info voters are going to pay no mind to which Congressperson s made it happen His approval ratings have tanked because of the recent fuckups but they ll likely fully recover once that money starts hitting peoples bank accounts  On top of that with Democrats coalescing around Joe Biden for the Presidential contest and keeping in mind that we still don t fully know how long this current crisis  or the coming ones will last I suspect overall turnout to be very depressed this year which is going to have some strange effects on downballot races 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fair enough I definitely would defer to a Michigonian s take on this As a fellow Midwesterner my worry is that Michigan may become a  flyover state But it s encouraging to hear otherwise Whitmer is the real deal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Open primaries are something I m unsure about because on one hand it makes things more democratic but on the other hand it makes it possible for opposition parties to sabotage another party s primary and elect a purposely bad or incompetent candidate
PoliticalDiscussion,IIRC an interesting poll in Texas showed that transplants backed Cruz and Native Texans backed O rourke After all it makes sense it seems like these people are leaving blue states because of cost of living issues and a dislike for those taxes   I think the more plausible explanation is that rather than blue state transplants shifting the state s politics it s more likely that growth in minority population and that nearly all major cities in the USA are socially liberal with suburbs becoming more socially liberal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think so I think that s a small amount of really loud people on Twitter and voters who Bernie managed to excite into caring who will probably not vote anyway I say this as someone who canvassed called and donated to Bernie many times   The vast majority of Bernie s coalition would vote for Biden over Trump in the fall My worry is that Biden doesn t exactly give them a good reason to turn out  every opportunity he s been given to speak to his progressive policy he s always on his back foot trying to fend off Sanders and just comes off as unwilling to place his values with Bernie s   He needs to get on stage at a debate and explain his student debt relief climate change tax reform and campaign finance reform and actually sound like he means it He could wrap this entire primary up in one fell swoop if he spoke to the left s values and policy goals instead of getting wrapped up in grappling matches with the person the left sees as best embodying those ideals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not just Kobach being as close as a human can get to being a POS but also Orman winning   of the vote Without that rd party spoiler Kansas would have elected another Cranial Rectal Syndrome devotee as governor 
PoliticalDiscussion,It won t ever be as blue as California but rapid urbanization in the Texas Triangle and Latino growth is slowly leading to closer margins They aren t going to totally blue like California but the dominance of Texas politics by the Republicans that started after the Republican revolution of  will come to an end this decade I do think however Democrats to tend to overstate how much of gains they will make in Texas it will still be competitive and will not look like the Left Coast or Northeast  In all honesty something like Florida or North Carolina is how Texas will look in the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like I said if it were feasible  I would definitely like to at least curtail their power  Open primaries for all federal level offices for a start plus publicly funded elections  I d like to also like to remove party identifiers from ballots candidate names only in randomized order 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honest question did Trump win Michigan in  more on his own merits Michigan being a swing state or Michiganders generally despising Hillary Clinton 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Would you expect Arizona to consistently go blue while Wisconsin consistently votes Republican   Arizona is a swing state in  margin of victory for Trump was    but where the Republicans do have an upside is that Arizona is a retiree state and elderly people tend to vote Republican   As for Wisconsin it has been competitive since  George W Bush was really close in winning in  and  seriously look it up we re talking about a margin of victory that was less than  twice What happened is Barack Obama most likely  over performed in midwest and that people see that Wisconsin did vote for a Republican for president before Trump since  so people assumed that Wisconsin was much bluer than it was when in reality it s a been purple battleground     gt Will somewhere unexpected like Kansas or Oregon become competitive  Not Kansas they re too rural of a state and I don t anticipate major urban growth to change that   Oregon is another one that I doubt Eastern Oregon is really red but Western Oregon is blue and partisan sorting to Portland will keep it blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Purple It voted for Obama one more time than Indiana did Other than that its party control of governorship and state legislature is about the same  I figure Ohio has become a magenta state Notable Cincinnati is the reddest big city in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,To the extent urbanization is electoral destiny dunno about Tennessee Tennessee and North Carolina are the only states with  or more Electors but with less than  of their populations living in urban areas The main distinction between Tennessee and North Carolina is racial demographics African Americans make up a much smaller  of Tennessee s population 
PoliticalDiscussion,It  may be possible to flip control of the Texas House and or Senate in the next election before US Congressional districts are redrawn This could possible end or at least mitigate our absurd gerrymandering I hope to God the Democrats run with this as the main plank of their platform 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or the plague Last time I heard it didn t have any political consequences at all did it 
PoliticalDiscussion,FWIW same reasoning applies to North Carolina  If Idaho isn t careful there may be enough immigrants from California that by  it may have become purple 
PoliticalDiscussion,It could be a death kneel for him if this COVID  pandemic in the USA gets so bad that over   dies the unemployment rate goes to   then Trump s admin will look like an incompetent administration 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean I don t know how that could even be done As many bad aspects as they tend to have they re also the only real way politics gets done because it allows ideologically aligned people to congregate and in the case of primaries choose the people they think best represent them
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe OP meant the entire decade i e  that    s  was a typo and    s   was meant 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a bit strange innit how quick people are to conjure up personal flaws as the cause rather than consider systematic issues South Korea isn t handling the crisis better than the US due to eating less avocado They learnt from previous outbreaks and built the infrastructure required to handle future ones A response which it turns out was much better than effectively gutting the CDC   As for the economic side of things it s not terribly difficult to find stuff like this    As an aside I wonder what form of food or beverage will be blamed for the climate catastrophes 
PoliticalDiscussion,California s non Hispanic white voter population has become a minority and continues to shrink due to immigration A lot of these immigrants often want to bring their family to the US which makes most of them opposed to the Republican party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe but Kansas s governor and Alabama s junior Senator may also owe their elections more to Republicans effectively embracing mass electoral suicide by nominating truly execrable human beings so bad that many Republicans just couldn t stand to vote for them than any appreciable increase in voters leaning more towards Democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,His low was inn the s but even in  when he was re elected he only had a  approval rating
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Montana is a state to watch  Only in terms of the Senate In  it may finally have a nd Representative so a whopping  Electors However it has  Senators like every other State  Montana does seem to be much more independent than the surrounding ruby red states of Idaho Wyoming and the Dakotas  Re California Republicans made themselves toxic at the statewide level by their support of Prop  It passed then was challenged and ruled unconstitutional in federal court It was California Republican s great Pyrrhic victory from which they may never recover You d need a Republican as socially liberal as Schwartenegger to have any chance of winning statewide elections  To the extent self proclaimed    real   Republicans as opposed to RINOs distinguish themselves by slavish adherence to Christian Right talking points and priorities I doubt there s going to be a Republican resurgence either on the Pacific coast or in the Northeast Before the current catastrophe Republicans had abandoned any pretense of still harboring any fiscal conservatives in their ranks Nope only the magical thinking that ever lower tax rates is the only way to generate more tax revenues is the only acceptable fiscal position within today s Republican Party 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean there are other races on the ballot that are supposed to be more important and more reflective of their constituency That should get people to vote even if the party they prefer is out of play at a higher level But the increasing nationalization of politics basically means that Americans are more ignorant than ever of the people in power and positions of importance in their cities and states  At the same time they re more invested than ever in national politics It s one of the largest reasons for the extreme polarization we re seeing today  Getting people to give a shit about their city councils or their county boards is damn near impossible though 
PoliticalDiscussion,It won t matter the GOP as it is today won t exist in another  years A non incumbent republican hasn t won the popular vote since  and they continue to pull a smaller share with each election Education is now the primary predictor of white voting patterns and educational attainment continues to increase with each generation As the Baby Boomer cohort begins to age out of the voter pool they simply aren t being replaced with new younger conservatives   Whatever we ll be looking at in the  s it won t be contemporary conservativism 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dont see Kansas or Oregon getting close especially Oregon as it is probably gonna get bluer at the rate Portland is growing and shifting that way Rust belt is hard to say Arizona is already a swing state could be likely D by  but I dont see it being safe by then Notth Carolina could possibly shift more blue to Charlotte is booming and the suburbs are getting less conservative Texas and Georgia are a little further down the road but could be swing states by  or  
PoliticalDiscussion,that s been an ongoing thing for a long time tho Its a trope that NYers retire in FL
PoliticalDiscussion,It s both immigration and state to state migration causing the surge in Texas population In    people moved to Texas  from other countries while another  came from other states     What difference does it make either way though The Texas electorate is changing no matter where the new voters come from 
PoliticalDiscussion,It might help some if people believed their vote counted  So    need the machines to print out the ballot and have the ballot printout scanned 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would add vote via mail or in person at the US Post Office for national offices  President VP Members of the US House Members of the US Senate  A fourth  dream   We should be able to remove SCOTUS jurists from their lifetime appointment via majority national vote   put it on the ballot after a petition gets x number of citizen signatures 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be honest    I think the election is a done deal at this point Trump will be reelected  Americans don t tend to switch administrations in the middle of a major American crisis  I hope to God I m wrong and we get an actual grown up in the White House but I have zero confidence in my fellow Americans to kick this clown to the curb 
PoliticalDiscussion,if they can untangle themselves from all that horrible gerrymandering ugh
PoliticalDiscussion,The states where most republicans died from covid because they didn t listen to science
PoliticalDiscussion,    s  Urbanization seems to be a significant determiner of Democratic voting   That s partly why Maine and New Hampshire aren t solidly Democratic states  Arizona is heading towards  urban population and North Carolina isn t far behind I figure those are more likely to become purple  In contast Florida will remain a swing state because of the number of retirees moving there who want low taxes and don t give a flying     about schools since their own children are through school and for most of them their children would be daft enough to send their grandchildren to Florida schools  If Texas s population becomes ever more concentrated in the triangle formed by Dallas Fort Worth Houston and San Antonio it may become purple  OTOH Kansas north through North Dakota are unlikely to change much despite Kansas currently having a Republican governor Re Kansas it currently has a Democratic governor because of an exceptionally strong showing in  by a rd party candidate and having the posterboy for all things wrong with Republicans Kris Kobach as their gubernatorial nominee Almost Roy Moore bad Kansas Democrats can t count on Kansas Republicans repeating that kind of mass electoral suicide pact  Oregon is all about population growth patterns The bulk of the population lives along I from Eugene Springfield north to Portland That s its Democrats heartland Maybe also along the Columbia River As for the coast it s a mix of tourist places and former logging towns which make the Rust Belt seem lively The real question is population growth in the southeastern third of the state what many want to believe should be part of Greater Idaho 
PoliticalDiscussion,Due to immigration isnt it 
PoliticalDiscussion,random question but the other day I was looking at Michigan s election history and at least gubernatorially it seems like its a clear wipeout of either Republicans or Democrats in any given election without it trending over time one way or the other Any idea why that would be Do Michiganites just sort of come to a consensus during an election 
PoliticalDiscussion,You made your claim first Bring out your evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Off year governor elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas  It might not be ready to go blue by  but it has enough electoral votes and will be close enough to competitive that every presidential candidate will put most of their focus on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her Tammy Baldwin or Gretchen Whitmer
PoliticalDiscussion,That s kind of the irony here and I think it was a Trump specific idea When you think of Michigan you think of automakers and unions as being one of the driving forces of the population and economy I know that s oversimplifying it but I can t ever imagine it going red presidentially for anything except a populist Unions have been screwed over by Republicans and ignored by Democrats which I think is a huge failure on the part of Democrats to not work to unfuck what Republicans have done for workers rights and work to rebuild unions and union membership among  blue collar workers 
PoliticalDiscussion,As opposed to literally every other state 
PoliticalDiscussion,I honestly think it s already blue but we ve had some pretty egregious voter suppression holding it back Once it swings blue I think there s no turning back 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t really know about it a growing portion of people in my area are starting to dislike Trump a bit but I also live in one of the most liberal counties in Kansas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Johnson county is in the aforementioned third district or KCK metro So yes it kicked Yoder to the door Its still a fourth of kansas the metros also at odds with all of kansas Its like its own thing despite its economic power 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the context that he came  so close Had there been more voter turnout instead of the typical lack of participation from Texas voters on top of some voter suppression in key areas he likely would have won 
PoliticalDiscussion,What are you arguing with me about You think Biden should pick a man because having a VP is the thing that ll tank his campaign I m fully aware that misogyny led the  campaign and working class white men couldn t stand it Well this time they have Biden I don t think they ll abandon him for a woman VP He s still top ticket And again Democrats cannot and will not win without getting women and POC to come out in force   so why not recognize that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I dont know personally while I am not old enough to vote in  I supported Trump but now I dont so there s that Also Johnson County has gotten bigger and we also voted in a Democratic governor and if I m not mistaken a Democratic Senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,In what context 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I thought Seems like there are a few more though    gt FiveThirtyEight identifies the states of Colorado Florida Iowa Michigan Minnesota Ohio Nevada New Hampshire North Carolina Pennsylvania Virginia and Wisconsin as  perennial swing states that have regularly seen close contests over the last few presidential campaigns   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt abolishing the EC is terrible for the GOP  Probably not by the end of this decade  The popular vote margin is relatively small usually  But winner takes all can be highly distortive  If AZ TX   GA are lean blue or purple then the GOP route to  will be considerably harder as that is  votes now  more after   Of recent Republicans Trump won the biggest margin above  and he only had  votes in excess  Obama has margins of x and x 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You may see Nebraska split since it splits its EC by district with  at large and Omaha  think its Omaha has been bleeding its red out for blue No major effect since its  EC but still  If that gets reliably blue they d just switch back to winner takes all  They almost did it after Obama won it in  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt he s undoubtedly going to do a lot more campaigning  Is that a good thing  The more he talks the more he turns people off  He d be better off sending surrogates and resources there  I almost feel he might have done worse in some primary states he won if he actually went and opened his mouth 
PoliticalDiscussion,VA seems to be there already  GA s margins from last cycle were already in swing state status  Maybe their voter suppression methods will hold it back a few more cycles but it will likely be overcome eventually       OH s margins last cycle seems to have moved into lean red territory 
PoliticalDiscussion,That would make the situation so much worse It would be the election of who can appease the big cities the most Virtually every smaller state would get forgotten
PoliticalDiscussion,Arizona might be a swing state or lean blue  Oregon might well be a swing state at that point  Some of the statewide elections seem to have gotten closer than they should be but it is too early to say yet  It could just be those particular races rather than a state trend as the legislature seats still seem solidly blue     TX and GA should be swing states by then       MN   NH would also be ones to watch  I think most of the midwest swing states will increasingly move into lean red territory due to outwards migration     If billionaires build new cities in small red states that might swing some states and take their senate seats too      
PoliticalDiscussion,I honestly think republicans would start a war if dems tried to get rid of the electoral college
PoliticalDiscussion,Def in areas with high latino populations
PoliticalDiscussion,This is all fairly reasonable and I d mostly just disagree on the degrees of effectiveness but I do want to contend that the divisiveness was not only online This is at least part of why you saw that voters for other candidates didn t switch to bernie when their own candidate dropped out As a pete supporter it was certainly one of the reasons I voted warren in the primary instead We also saw a lot of the divisiveness exaggerated across MSM which I m sure impacted the general public 
PoliticalDiscussion,Self preservation and voter apathy is probably stronger imo
PoliticalDiscussion,Reinfranchise of ex fellons should have a moderate shift of about   votes to the Democrats    Most ex felons don t vote and the ones that do usually split  but Florida has mostly black and non cuban Hispanic folks as ex felons and their white ex felon population was already mostly reinfranchised so we should actually see some Democratic gains there  this is why the Govenor tried to set up a poll tax for those ex felons Fortunately it was struck down 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t invest too time interpreting the rise in popularity One reason is that he is going to be re elected barring illness or death I saw President Clinton re elected I saw President Bush the second re elected I saw the guy before President Trump get re elected I m going to see the current president get re elected    except if he becomes ill or dies    This is my conclusion based upon my experience no matter my preference 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How many  year old guys are willing to die to support Trump Probably not that many  I m just not sure they see it this way Pride and belief are a hell of a drug   But I guess it just depends on how bad it really gets 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s an agressive timeline for Texas I d say  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Ted Cruz was eligible then she d be eligible It s never been tested because we ve never had a situation where someone was elected who hadn t been born in a State but per the naturalization and citizenship laws we have she should be considered a natural born citizen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Disagree a bit here Online they might say one thing but it s another when their life is on the line How many  year old guys are willing to die to support Trump Probably not that many   The danger to old folks may suppress their turnout and old folks vote Republican 
PoliticalDiscussion, unpopular 
PoliticalDiscussion,She s young and competent and a better public speaker than Biden Would probably see a bunch of joint appearences She would do little to harm the Sanders ticket   Still I d love to see someone from the Midwest on here 
PoliticalDiscussion,He came close sure while spending record amounts of money against an unpopular Senator 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is why preventative measures shouldn t be predicated upon individuals Give it a couple years without some major disaster and people will start cutting funding since it s  obviously not needed  until said disaster occurs again which always happens    Funding infrastructure with the intent of preventing things long term is a better solution than hoping Steve and everyone else remembers exactly what they are supposed to do during a pandemic and won t need any coordination   If you don t trust the government then build an anarchist community as well since that s pretty much their ballgame  community without hierarchy and distrust towards the system  But don t have the lesson be that people should just not buy coffee in the future Just please have the point actually be good 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine history books talking about how the collapse of Western society was caused by a preference for green fruit  Yeah I don t get why people are so gung ho about blaming individuals for systematic problems Especially when the evidence they use is anecdotal rather than backed up with actual data which btw tends to show said systematic issues being the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,No but I think it had a lot to do with why he lost Texas Democrats have guns too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mentioned Bush but you re right a lot of towns in Rhode Island last voted Republican for Reagan until Trump A lot of the blue collar white Catholics were solidly Democratic but they are swinging to the Republicans RI was solidly Democratic historically because of them I d say it is unlikely that it becomes like West Virginia WV fit in well with the conservatism of the Republican Party in a way that Rhode Island doesn t The Democrats went from being the champions of the mining unions to the enemy of coal down in WV I think Providence will ensure that there is a Democratic lean even  years in the future but it still doesn t rule out RI being competitive in the future I think we ll have to see what happens in November if Biden can win it with a similar margin to Obama rather than Hillary then maybe  was an aberration  I think it was the same in Connecticut Trump won towns that last voted for Bush Sr Vermont was a smaller win for the Dems because of people writing in Bernie Sanders and voting third party But in NH Maine Rhode Island and Connecticut Trump made serious gains I wonder if this is more anti Hillary sentiment Trump s populism or is it that the alignment of working class rural whites to the GOP has reached into liberal New England 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas
PoliticalDiscussion,My only justification isn t particularly logical  though no original source of a chain of logic could be without being circular   The only thing that ISN T automated is whatever we call a  soul  Atheists usually treat the words for brain mind and soul as synonyms but I have some intuition that says otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know the answer He s opposed to perceived  other kinds  It s not about immigration mate It s about xenophobia 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gun control
PoliticalDiscussion,Humans are automated  Not some joke human beings are fully automated  I have more convincing arguments against this than I have ever heard such as  society sets us up to go a certain path and we don t choose what situation we live in   Unless the rules for reality known as  logic  are magically different for our body than for  inanimate matter we cannot choose anything We cannot bend the rules of physics  The weird thing is people accept it on a microscopic level  They accept that serotonin s flow through a serotonin transporter is because of the differences of concentrations of serotonin between the synaptic cleft and the cytosol  They accept that electrochemical impulses merely according to logic control their behaviour  But somehow  No I can make choices like this  lifts arm  The only argument I have against it is that I  feel like I m in control and I personally trust rationality more than feeling 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stopping travel wasn t enough You know he also fired the CDC s pandemic response team right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump doesn t set the timeline the virus does 
PoliticalDiscussion,It absolutely fucking never work but this is all valid I agree 
PoliticalDiscussion,Humans are stupid and illogical  in behaviour   Which is precisely why this could never work 
PoliticalDiscussion,HAHAHAHAHA your ideas are good  But your view of humanity is   More generous than the whole of humanity
PoliticalDiscussion,The dems today are divided between the progressive wing and the moderate wing Since Biden comes from the Moderate wing of the party it is wise to choose a female progressive to be his running mate in order to balance the ticket and unite the party With that in mind I can think of two people who fulfills the criteria Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard Of those two I think Tulsi is a better choice as Elizabeth Warren is prone to committing acts of political suicide like the DNA video and recently her progressive credentials is becoming more and more questionable On the other hand Tulsi despite only attracting  of support among Democrats isn t prone to doing that and her progressive credentials is unquestionable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also his performance in the debates came off as incredibly insincere 
PoliticalDiscussion,and as reds leave to Idaho 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess the only argument is that Bernie has already lost two national elections and has clear problems of appealing to traditional Democrats so it s pretty clear that his strategy of the youth and first time voters hasn t worked 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a Texan nope Most people won t remember it come next election and if Beto isn t the one running they won t care The real reason that Texas is going Blue is the fact it has  massive cities that are growing and getting more and more blue and most people in cities don t care much for guns as a general rule 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean Cruz won by   Yeah unprecedented success for a Democrat but it was still a solid win for Cruz and Beto had funding coming in from all over the country 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt she got more votes though  Not in Michigan 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is very hard to earn the votes of the Sanders supporters Even Bernie didn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did Beshear win because of his own qualities or because Kentuckians realize what a fool Bevin was I figure Democrats won governorships in Wisconsin Kansas and Kentucky in the last few years more due to the flaws of the Republican candidates than the voters in those states starting to prefer Democrats Of course of those states Republican primary voters have become capable only of nominating human fecal matte perhaps they ll train their states voters to vote for Democrats in general elections In the Age of Trump Republicans just might be that idiotic 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden is much more popular in the rust belt  He won the Michigan primary for one thing which Hillary lost in  and he s undoubtedly going to do a lot more campaigning and a lot more internal polling in the rust belt It s not going to be overlooked this time and without that Trump is in trouble  I have some reservations how unique Michigan s dislike for Hillary was I expect Trumps attacks on Biden s support for NAFTA to hurt him in Michigan as well Though I do agree it is probably not gonna hurt him to the same extent as it hurt Hillary 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Republican can win a place on the November ballot without appealing to Kern Plumas and Siskiyou counties  Half sarcasm Then there s no way they could win in November  Schwarzenegger won the only way a Republican could as the main alternative to a recalled Democratic governor then reelection as an incumbent Hard to arrange the former OK more half sarcasm  The only practical way for a Republican to win the governorship or a Senate seat would be if  or more Democrats spit so much of the statewide open primary vote that the Republican came in st place and the leading Democrat had the support of less than  of Democrats and there was enough ill will among those Democrats that they d prefer a Republican to the wrong sort of Democrat I figure if Maryland and Massachusetts can keep on electing Republican governors California should be able to but California isn t going to elect a business person who s never run for political office before If the pool were California s Republican state legislators there s not going to be a Republican governor for another few generations None of them could find their way out of a square room with  walls missing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perspective    She can change the outcome locally if she can cause a chain of events thst swings the state to other party but she can t change and can t have nationwide effect   That s why conservatives oppose it If college is abolished nobody can impact or influence the outcome And they think they can be drown out by immigrants from somewhere else   Selfish but understandable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is probably why the GOP will take a different path in the future 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Partisan aligned fluff like the fact that the GOP bill ignored American workers in favor of throwing billions into a slush fund for Trump to use in secrecy at his discretion   Got some sources for this right Because the American people know the crap Nancy Pelosi was trying to stuff into the bill and as it was originally written bi partisan with  Democrats working on it I m doubtful they wouldn t of made a stink about this bill being a slush fund for Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Local races are not the same as national races Massachusetts also  reelected their Republican governor by double digits doesn t mean Trump has a chance 
PoliticalDiscussion,If anything DC metro is growing due to all the tech jobs 
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah I know just mean for other elections
PoliticalDiscussion,Gerrymandering won t matter in a state wide race and presidential election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that s exactly what happened Matt Bevin was horrible and acted like a POS 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump basically validated GOP s attempt to consolidate power using their current power structure If Trump lost in  they would have shifted but right now they will double down on their white high school educated voter base instead of trying to broaden their appeal 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not getting close It wasn t close when Andy s dad a Democrat who was governor for  years and it won t be close for the foreseeable future Republicans won down the ballot in a big way Beshear ran against the most hated governor and won by less than   He s actually pretty awesome which is nice But Kentucky isn t purple and won t be especially if the Democrats follow this progressive trend 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t really see progressives being much of a force in the coming years without bernie to lead them  I think the progressive wing of the party is on the rise but people online really overestimate their appeal to the more moderate right leaning states and districts Case in point the Justice dems flipped exactly zero seats in the midterms while the moderates won back the house for the democratic party    gt They didn t come out to vote this primary   They absolutely did it s just that they are outnumbered by the moderates and hit their present ceiling of   in the democratic electorate which is by no means an insignificant margin obviously    gt They alienated the rest of the Democratic Party  Only online and most of the actual voters didn t even witness this progressive vs centrist divide on sites like twitter reddit etc People really overestimate how many people care about this kind of stuff   gt But the conversation will definitely be ongoing between moderates and progressives I just don t think there will be someone as big a threat as Bernie for a while  Probably Bernie was able to unite the progressive base in a way which is kinda unprecedented I think Obama also ran a progressive campaign in  but the establishment and the moderate african american voters were also on board his coalition so it wasn t as big of a deal 
PoliticalDiscussion,The suburban women are anti Trump This campaign is between urban rural and suburbs and suburban women are pissed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m from Wisconsin and I can only speak from my own experience here It could easily go either way As with most states the rural areas go Republican and the urban areas go Democrat  mostly  I think it really depends on how our cities evolve   If smaller cities like Eau Claire or LaCrosse expand significantly or if even smaller towns start to get more deadly populated I could easily see a shift to Democrat   However it appears that most government officials at least in my district are trying to discourage the expansion of cities in favor of local farming and such Therefore I would say that it will most likely remain Republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,I misspoke Was referring to the recent polling about his handling of the Coronavirus 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not even red for state elections tbf the margins for their senate and governor races are usually EXTREMELY close The Dems just can t seem to be able to convince that final   of voters that reliably go republican

PoliticalDiscussion,Sure and I think this still fits with the op comment framework Since this is happening it is likely the Republican party will shift over time to win more urban voters That could take a few different forms and all of them are a divergence from Trumpism that is offensive to those in urban areas but someone will attempt it   That is assuming that demographics gets ahead of the current Republican strategy of eschewing the pursuit of a true majority in favor of voter suppression disenfranchisement gerrymandering small state overrepresentation in the Senate judicial stacking and using current power to entrench their power  eg NC governor neutering  That s working for now unfortunately It does also have the side effect of leaving their party out to dry in places like California where the national platform sinks local politicians thereby leaving large chunks of rural people in deep blue states utterly powerless 
PoliticalDiscussion,The city elected Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg not too long ago Manhattan and post gentrification Brooklyn are solidly liberal but history has shown that Queens and Staten Island could go red under the right circumstances 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush shot up to  almost immediately Not so for Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,The President s approval rankings have not tanked A few months ago it was stable around  or   Since the pandemic hit Trump s approval rating rose to   It would seem that he s doing fine for approval without the checks even being sent yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas is in the single digit margins for statewide races and the turnout is still below   That means there is a lot of voters to still turnout and most of them are Hispanic if Democrats manage to register them in big numbers I can see Texas quickly flipping just like Virginia did in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I could be wrong but I believe diversity is an old old wooden ship used during the civil war era 
PoliticalDiscussion,By  a solid blue wall will be in pace due to demographic changes an aging population and migration Republicans will never win another national election again They re done Everything is completely static Big tent parties never adapt and voters never change their preferences 
PoliticalDiscussion,Forming the connection between voting for a candidate and feeling the impact of their policies is still far beyond the abilities of the average American voter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas 
PoliticalDiscussion,the margin in the last  or so Governor s races in FL has been pretty much less than  points often  point or less That does not a solid red state make it s basic math 
PoliticalDiscussion,it would be a negative if he lost overwhelmingly    losing by  points for a statewide Texas seat is probably more encouraging than discouraging 
PoliticalDiscussion,People are not gonna like this answer Just as background I studied Political Science and I m a dual national Australian American I know my political theory and comparative politics State viability is a strong interest of mine I know what I m talking about and I m not exaggerating here  There is a very real possibility that the United States of America won t last that long  The USA is one of the oldest regimes in the world We have the world s oldest constitution Most modern constitutions are book length India s is over  pages America s is just  pages long We don t have the same legal securities that most modern states do Our nation survives on good will and strenuous effort Over the last  years our institutions have been eroded to a degree not even equaled by the years leading up to the Civil War We are in dangerous territory  We currently have a President who has been impeached but denies it He s the only President to ever have a vote against him from his own party in a Senate conviction trial He was aided in his election by the Russians our most adversarial rival a nation which has conquered  territories unopposed in the last  years and is an unabashed enemy of democracy He compelled the Ukrainians to interfere with the coming election something they had no intention of doing but had to lest they too be conquered by the Russians His crimes are too numerous to list but the above are the greatest threats to American democracy  He is now refusing to aid States which he considers disloyal during a global pandemic This pandemic is the greatest threat our nation has known in living memory His hometown of New York City is the epicenter of the crisis and he doesn t care that they only have one tenth of the ventilators that they need By all appearances he s going to save the States that voted for him and sacrifice the ones that didn t  I m Californian We will not stand for this Our men stormed the beaches of Normandy alongside the New Yorkers and the Texans There is not a State in America that would not take arms against this government if it refuses to serve our best interests Our people will not die for indifference of Trump  For this Union to survive change must take place  now  
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas will probaly be at lesst purple  if not blue same with Arizona 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao Imagine being upset that a group of people votes 
PoliticalDiscussion, isn t a presidential election year

PoliticalDiscussion,Additionally majority voters in  safe states also stay home since well why not People are lazy and if they don t see that their voting will affect the outcome then they tend to stay home  Unless they are old Old people go vote as a team outing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A fourth  dream  We should be able to remove SCOTUS jurists from their lifetime appointment via majority national vote   put it on the ballot after a petition gets x number of citizen signatures  I can t say that I think  this is a good idea Having justices needing to toe the populist line is terrible from a minority rights perspective and would erode the protection against a fascist undermining of the court I know I know that sounds ridiculous but it s happened elsewhere There s a good reason the court is set up as it is  Changing the  nomination process might well be worth revisiting however 
PoliticalDiscussion,Virginia and Colorado   Safe blue
PoliticalDiscussion,I can agree with this assessment Roy Blunt  and Billy Long for myself personally will be here for a bit I think you re correct in the assessment of what may happen if Trump wins 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I agree and I will say they will probably be pretty solidly red until     Short someone like Adkins running as a candidate i dont see the GOP changing to widely this year  they have a Trump shaped anchor    Roy Blunt is well Roy Blunt so he won t change That s the ballot of  I think  no governor   So  seems the earliest If Trump wind  then i don t see anything changing but if he loses there may be some shift since the GOP may realign without the megaphone Maybe 
PoliticalDiscussion,people have short memories 
PoliticalDiscussion,For every apathetic voter there s  apathetic voter who won t vote regardless of what you do Largely nonvoters don t vote because they don t want to Getting them to have the desire to vote is a long term project There isn t some magical turnout button 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would remind you that the left was split between Warren and Sanders and at a certain point she commanded more of the progressive wing of the party She lost it when she got wrapped up in healthcare and would no longer uneqivocally say she was for MA That and a host of other things cost her the progressive left who realized she wasn t willing to stand by those positions even when it was costly She hedged her bets between progressives and moderates and lost because progressives didn t believe she was their candidate anymore   I think the narrative you have about Sanders supporters is too colored by reddit and twitter Bernie consistently has won a majority of people  and younger Bernie s supporters aren t fanatics that the Democratic party can write off they re the future of the party They re not  Bernie or bust  they have real issues they want addressed that Biden is not convincing them he can   Pete Buttigieg in the early days of his campaign walked this line way better than Biden He agreed to disagree on the specifics but wholeheartedly came down on the same side as Bernie and Warren on most if not all issues He became absolutely reviled by young people when he did a sprint to the right to capture older voters for Iowa and New Hampshire and made it clear he only cared about those issues so long as they made him successful His willingness to attack things young voters consider core values has earned him the title  rat boy among the more vocal left  Biden doesn t need to tack to the left He needs to state  his own policy platform on camera and do it with conviction He needs to say what he ostensibly believes without sounding like he s offering them Bernie lite His platform is very similar to Bernie s  platform if he really believes it he needs to own it and he ll win support from progressives 
PoliticalDiscussion,It makes sense I mean hey my girlfriend is liberal and I consider myself a socialist we re thinking about moving from NC to VA either this year or next There s important reasons at play etc but the icing on the cake is that it s a blue state NC is very conservative still overall 
PoliticalDiscussion,And before that a penny but both this are before my time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kate Brown is was a weak candidate Corporate Dems are never going to fare too well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whitmer is a non starter Governors have way too much real work to do right now for a vp run and abandoning her position to run would be seen as abandoning her state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Outside of Fox News I don t know who gave Trump one billion dollar worth of advertisements Unless you count non stop portyal of him as a racist sexist incompetent impulsive buffoon He is the president His every action and decision need to be covered The news media shouldn t collectively decide he should be ignored 
PoliticalDiscussion,Used to be a dime 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden have a plan for student debt relief He caused it    xB       xB  Also he s been trying to cut social security for decades I m not sure you ll convince the left he isn t for austerity   because he is And Harris time as a prosecutor isn t going to win over anyone Both are drug warriors and the pro marijuana voting block is larger than people think 
PoliticalDiscussion,As an Illinois resident I can say Chicago is safely blue the rest of the state is red So Illinois will go to the Democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigan also has a D governor and  D senators 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like her but that essentially gives a senate seats to the R s in what will at best be a narrow D senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Funny the GOP had the same dynamics The hard right folks blame McCain s and Romney s moderation for their losses Yeah right
PoliticalDiscussion,To add about Cali the party of Devin Nunes and Duncan Hunter is going nowhere beyond the Central Valley whites and the State of Jefferson In fact I think it could be said that the GOP here is effectively dead  However moderate republicans do very well here LA even had a very well appreciated Republican mayor fairly recently If a unifying centrist Republican emerged it would change a lot Keep in mind many Hispanics are fairly conservative family oriented people Just when you demonize them they will despise you   The GOP needs to change nationally to keep with demographics That change may emerge in Cali Just think if the GOP flipped Cali It will never happen with a divider like Trump and the current GOP mindset But with a big tent Republican it might 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see the GOP making more appeals to social conservatism and casting Dems as socially far left as most ethnic minorities are fairly socially conservative
PoliticalDiscussion,Very very true But I don t see progressives rallying around anyone who DOESN T only have niche appeal I doubt they ve given up on the  rally disaffected voters rather than  attract those that vote strategy 
PoliticalDiscussion,All Incumbent parties or presidents rise during crisis And to be perfectly honest Trump isn t doing a bad job in reality  But how that affects November Who knows That s way to early to tell 
PoliticalDiscussion,Less progressive white urban center landslide but more moderate black and worker turnout for Dems Don t think it s enough to flip many states tho
PoliticalDiscussion,Only  of workers are union nowadays  that s probably why
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I am curious to see if progressives can build a stronger coalition or fall apart without Bernie at their head Maaaaybe they can rally around AOC but I have a feeling she ll become more tempered with time and too establishment for a lot of Bernie s base It ll be more along the lines of another complete outsider that gets them I feel  I think AOC is too niche in her appeal and would fail ever harder at compromising and building a wider coalition things people say Bernie fell short at AOC s not even well liked in her own state her district loves her but overall her approval is close to  in the state And even if she does manage to build that sort of coalition   the GOP has already started Hilary ing her ensuring she d have a much harder time in a general election because everyone and their mother s being blasted with AOC and negative news coverage from all sorts of conservative outlets 
PoliticalDiscussion,Therefore  ChinaVirus makes more sense
PoliticalDiscussion,Why  TrumpPandemic he is handling it very well the WHO director said so Calling the TrumpPandemic only helps cover up who s fault this really is China s the covered it up and caused this to be  percent worse then if they hadnt been the filthy government they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Atlanta metro area is exploding in growth Those aren t republicans moving in 
PoliticalDiscussion,The same could be said for its chances of going red   Because it s a swing state right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Illinois had a Republican governor until  Maryland has one right now Kentucky Louisiana and Kansas have D governors currently   The lesson isn t that those states are or will become swing states Its that some politics can still be local 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just going to start with the fact that I don t think that the current alignments of both parties will exist in the s However as a thought experiment If a state such as Texas becomes a consistent swing state expect New England states to become target states as part of a post mortem report in the  or  elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even if he adopted Bernie s platform exactly they ll just point to his history and say he can t be trusted to enact those It s what s happened every single time a candidate has adopted Bernie s policies in an attempt to entire that voter base Heck Elizabeth Warren who was probably second closest to bernie in the primaries faced this exact treatment  It really just feels like a lost cause I would say he should just move left because he should not to try and capture Bernie s disillusioned supporters They ll line up behind the next populist anti establishment candidate and nothing less 
PoliticalDiscussion,But Maryland elections are not a competition between Virginia and Maryland 
PoliticalDiscussion,Giving felons the right to vote as well as large scale immigration from Puerto Rico should move the state more leftward
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there will be no usa by the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its very difficult to predict that far out If you go back historically I don t think anybody had a clue as to how the EC would look  years out The party tents change all the time In  years you may see coalitions you d never expect You may see the results of various state governance affect immigration emigration patterns of said state The parties can also go in many directions   Here s an example What if after two terms of Trump the Republican party generally sees it as a long term mistake and as such pivot back toward Mitt Romney style candidates as opposed to doubling down on Trump style candidates Perhaps Republicans will have the same conclusion if Biden wins convincingly in November Or perhaps the exact opposite conclusion is drawn in these circumstances That can REALLY change the party demography Its difficult to say what narrative takes hold Same with Democrats A Biden win or loss is a binary situation that generate either conclusion of each outcome depending on how the narrative takes hold and so that is  potential outcomes Democrats may think a Biden loss was due to to much progressivism or not enough If he wins progressives might argue it was because of it not despite it while moderates may argue the opposite   How those intraparty debates take hold will drive a lot I think   What I do know is neither party will ever be capable of sustaining a majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not It will go the route of VA which is now a blue state and it s not coming back The population growth here is insane and it s not old rural red voters moving here It s urban minded people from the north east mid west and west coast It will be a swing state through  at the latest and not in play for republicans after that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Judging by how the president is treating the MI governor I don t see them going red this fall but I don t know how popular she is there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio is red because of extreme gerrymandering by a Republican controlled state government 
PoliticalDiscussion,More upset that a group of people have been brainwashed their whole lives into voting for the same crooked oligarchy that has us in this unstable economic position in the first place 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt His hometown of New York City is the epicenter of the crisis and he doesn t care that they only have one tenth of the ventilators that they need By all appearances he s going to save the States that voted for him and sacrifice the ones that didn t  Did NY not get   of the national stockpile  Cuomo wants k the national stockpile is only  k 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I just cant see it being given statehood political pressure is against adding more senators to either party for any reason  If PR wanted it then won t democratic control of the senate be sufficient if they get rid of the fillibuster  Would altering the status of DC require a constitutional amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh yea no it absolutely wasn t as much social media as the firebrand politics and MSM I m looking more at the whole Bernie having to defend the accusation of sexism from Elizabeth Warren blowing up and causing a division  I do agree with the your post here I think people really underestimated how people like the establishment and how much people value personal comfort over taking a chance at structural change   I am curious to see if progressives can build a stronger coalition or fall apart without Bernie at their head Maaaaybe they can rally around AOC but I have a feeling she ll become more tempered with time and too establishment for a lot of Bernie s base It ll be more along the lines of another complete outsider that gets them I feel 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I knew  that  I was just hoping to get him to say it out loud 
PoliticalDiscussion,It ll be very interesting to see the margin this year I expect Trump to win FL but I m curious to see if he makes gains over  
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems the growth is more concentrated in Virginia though not Maryland 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but California isn t going to elect a business person who s never run for political office before  They d probably win if they drafted a celebrity like Will Smith  Someone devoid of Republican political baggage would probably be the only hope 
PoliticalDiscussion,Giving an unreasonable timeline is like step  of project management just to get people talking  Its disappointing to see this handled like any other business deal
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see Georgia changing much imo 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but I do want to contend that the divisiveness was not only online This is at least part of why you saw that voters for other candidates didn t switch to bernie when their own candidate dropped out  If that sort of thing played a role it most certainly wasn t because of stuff that happened on social media because again most voters don t follow politics with that much fervor to stay informed about in party divisions I think the bigger problem was Bernie s firebrand of politics only appealed to so many people These would be the  or so democratic voters that I referenced in my above comment  he rallied against the establishment and as it turns out the core voting base of the democratic party actually likes their establishment and wants things to continue being the way they are at present I firmly believe if Bernie was able to sell his political style to these people he d have won big in South Carolina and Super Tuesday but something like that is much  much easier said than done since Bernie wouldn t have the base he does if his politics didn t have the fervor that it does These voters were always on the lookout for a safer candidate to come along and show his face Biden s win gave them that candidate and the rest is history But yeah not being to sell himself to these establishment voters is what doomed Bernie even after Nevada 
PoliticalDiscussion,Arizona lean Dem  Texas purple  Florida will lean GOP OH solidly GOP WI  PA lean GOP MI tilt GOP  Kinda evens out electorally
PoliticalDiscussion, gt However the Republican brand is toxic in the Trump era and the jungle primary system makes it harder for GOP to field token opposition to build on their brand I think there is room for an existing third party to make inroads in local offices in California or for a new party to split off from the Democrats but this would require a massive amount of political organizing Perhaps one of the tech billionaires can pull it off  The thing is why would a rd party do better than say another democrat challenging the democratic incumbent  The incumbent pretty much wins all the time due to name recognition  It sort of indicates that things need to get rather dire before the numbers shift enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kobach is the only candidate that would make the GOP keep an eye on it but he still wins it easily IMO  especially with Trump on the ballot 
PoliticalDiscussion,I  agree with Ohio however I m not so sure about Wisconsin Any particular reason you d include them 
PoliticalDiscussion,If only redditors voted every state would be blue  lmao
PoliticalDiscussion,No it wont get statehood
PoliticalDiscussion,Which means Florida is the only state now Well fuck Well time to riot and create a new America Seeya in he ll 
PoliticalDiscussion,One thing i notice is that their gubernational elections don t have Dems leading by the same margins as say the senate or their presidential elections  The governors seem to only win by  whereas Hilary won by like   
PoliticalDiscussion,Ken Paxton also won re election to AG but only by     Previously his margin was    That s a significant shift  There were also Dem gains in the state chambers US house 
PoliticalDiscussion,Beto coming that close is huge  People keep saying TX is gonna turn blue but we ve recently seen some evidence  The AG election was also quite close  The other statewide offices were still comfortable for TX  Dems gained  seats in the state house and need about the same to take control  there were enough competitive races in  for this to happen  obviously it was a wave year so  might not be so easy    Dems also gained  US House seats and more are predicted to fall  There s also more Republican incumbent resignations like Will Hurd 
PoliticalDiscussion, Riiiight   
PoliticalDiscussion,No she didnt
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A younger Hispanic woman  Why 
PoliticalDiscussion,Almost All  progressives lost
PoliticalDiscussion,I would argue that he did mismanage the situation with COVID  because he downplayed the situation for a couple of crucial weeks In that critical time the virus was spreading because people were essentially told to ignore the danger   But the most important and costly thing Trump the lack of testing exacerbated the situation massively Without being able to test people and trace their contacts the only other option to slow the spread was shutting everything down Normally you would test people and isolate them as early as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,He said he d like to have everything opened up by then  He didn t say we are for sure opening up then  This poor man can t win  No matter what he says he s gonna catch Hell for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,If poor and old people are killed of at a rate above  every red state will become a swing state
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup I m all about this answer  So much about political forecasting is predicting reactions not being proactive  Only thing I could see being  proactive is an aging electorate where Gen Z and Millenials are very liberal   democratic compared to the Silent and Boomers  X Eh Dunno   Even then  something happens and everyone can shift 
PoliticalDiscussion,OH is probably no longer a swing state Trump won it by     In the  elections Dems didn t win any statewide office  other than Sherrod Brown keeping his seat in the senate and only gained  seats in the state house  in the state senate  on the state supreme court  That was a blue wave year 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How should we interpret this  Oh gee I don t know  Maybe more people actually like him than people are lead to believe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whitmer has her flaws but her response to Coronavirus has been as good as anyone s Way better than the Federal government s She tried hard to balance the risks of infection  with the damage of shutting things down It s a hell of a decision sure but she did what I would have done when I would have done it Now assholes just need to LISTEN to the government s guidance  Michiganders don t like being told what to do  and we ll get a handle on it AND the President has to stop personally attacking our Governor and threatening to withhold aid because she calls him out on his failure One I m hopeful might happen the other we ll correct in November if we re at all worthwhile as a people 
PoliticalDiscussion,The projected crucial swing states for  are FL PA MI WI     Additionally GA AZ MN NC       NH and maybe  of the districts in ME and NE too but they don t matter much 
PoliticalDiscussion,It says  the s    Elections  it means elections in that decade
PoliticalDiscussion,No I d say that it really is because in Governor races Michigan IS a swing state Voter turnout and enthusiasm really matters here   It ll be interesting to see what happens with our State once the districts are drawn by the independent commission rather than whichever party happens to be in power Won t change the Governor s race but it will change things 
PoliticalDiscussion,First so far the Corona virus is only a coastal issue   it really hasn t hit his base yet And second   his rally is not much of a rally and his high water mark of approval would be considered pathetic for any other President   we just grade Trump on a very generous curve  If the virus plays out as badly as it many think it will   Trump may not just lose approval   but will physically lose voters who can help him win His base is older white men and this virus is lethal to that group 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It reads to me that based on when she was born that one parent is sufficient to have conferred birthright citizenship  For birth between December   and November   the U S citizen parent must have been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for  years prior to the person s birth at least five of which were after the age of  for the person to acquire U S citizenship at birth The U S citizen parent must be the genetic or the gestational parent and the legal parent of the child under local law at the time and place of the child s birth to transmit U S citizenship 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s not going to be any presidential election in  The President it elected every  years It happens this year               is not an integer 
PoliticalDiscussion,All this makes me wonder how Massachusetts was inoculated to Trump Might it be that unlike Providence and Hartford New Haven Fairfield County that Massachusetts is too blue for such inroads 
PoliticalDiscussion,Breitbart Quillette National Review etc are not as minor as you think Fox News is also by far the most watched cable news channel 
PoliticalDiscussion,Again it goes to laws over citizenship It reads to me that based on when she was born that one parent is sufficient to have conferred birthright citizenship However I know this has not been tested or ruled on But it does not necessarily disqualify her 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah the crazy thing is that almost everyone getting sick is pretty much inevitable just making sure there are doctors when you need them
PoliticalDiscussion,Statistically we don t really see that happening in meaningful numbers in open primary states 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Trump is basically thinking that he has a better chance to win reelection running against mass death than he does running against the economy that his mismanagement of the Coronavirus ruined  I don t think his mismanagement ruined the economy huge shutdowns were basically unavoidable The real problem is that he s too scared to do something which will prolong this considerably 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pennsylvania and New York are both states that are Midwestern in their western parts Buffalo is more similar to Detroit than it is NY Philly or Boston The accents in Buffalo and Detroit are also similar   Of course New York City is so huge that no one ever thinks about the Great Lakes region of NY State when they think of the state and its politics   I wonder if we ll see Western New York trend redder on the state legislative and Congressional level to match the trends in PA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not the same IIRC Ted Cruz was born to two US citizens Duckworth was born abroad to one US citizen Birth right citizenship has more conditions she might not meet when born to a single citizen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would proportional allocation increase the risk of no candidate getting   In that case that might be worse if it is thrown to the house and basically the whole election was pointless 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t say that Trump was as popular as GW I was saying that he got a boost in popularity in a crisis like Bush did 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Another way to ask this could be  should the state of Wyoming have approximately zero say in the executive branch of the union it swore allegiance to   Another way to look at this is to add up the electoral votes of the top  most populous states  They have  votes  Forget just Wyoming if the other  plus DC all combined to vote for party y but the top  vote for party x party x wins 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives enjoy their echo chamber too It s foolish to say they are exempt I think the liberal media is fractured across different stations and conservatives only have Fox News so head to head Fox News wins in ratings but if you pool Liberal Media vs Conservative Media at least for TV it s pretty even 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Then you would only go to states with high populations and not care about the rest  How did you conclude this  To me it is like you are still thinking within the framework of the old system even though there are now new rules and state lines are now irrelevant  Why would states be the relevant subunit now  Would it not make more sense for high population locales to be the focus if we go down this route  All states have cities      When candidates campaign in swing states now they devote a roughly proportional time in urban suburban and rural areas according to their share of the population  So why do they not only go to the high population centers now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the new normal is going to be more and more swing states Fewer states will be safe   Demographics change voter preferences change parties change and political candidates can change parties 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt if people in rural areas think that urban voters will so drastically outnumber their votes  Rural is   urban is    The rest is suburban and they are further split between dense and sparsely populated     We shouldn t not make good changes because idiots are going to be idiots regardless 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s like turning the court into another legislative branch  Is there any point in that given you already have  chambers in congress  They d need huge funds for retention elections  Wonder who ll be donating to that and who they will be dependent on   
PoliticalDiscussion,Anecdotally they re moving because their employers are they can afford housing in the lower cost of living south and the weather is better for most of the year That tells you nothing about their own personal political views 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The more he talks the more he turns people off   There s no evidence of this
PoliticalDiscussion,No although some of them do I am athiest though my position is not  god isn t real  but more of  The evidence strongly suggests no God of any remotely common sense exists  though I am not agnostic as I m not conflicted on the issue  I don t see that as a justification Just a requirement If you were to correctly claim  there exists a soul for every individual and it is separated from logic  then it is a justification 
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah you d probably also need to let the electoral college do a runoff to avoid that 
PoliticalDiscussion,While closed they re only paying rent While open they have to pay not just the rent but employees hours supplies utilities for the building   All that extra cost might overwhelm whatever they take in from risk taking movie goers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah totally just pointing it out because it gets overlooked in the massive growth elsewhere and is much larger than other countervailing trends 
PoliticalDiscussion,I thought I saw  somewhere I stand corrected then
PoliticalDiscussion,Change the senate rules then 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the California republic will once again stand strong under Colonel Freedom  The Midland wastes will be roadwarrior anarchy and nobody comes back from the eastern seaboard if the radiation won t kill you the cannibals will 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely will 
PoliticalDiscussion,Make sure you get your friends and family to vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,In what world is Biden lined up to beat Trump The dnc is basically handing Trump his second term Biden can t even put together coherent sentences he has a hard time in a debate against Sanders he is going to be eaten alive on stage by Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,On the native Texans point I think there could be two potential kinks to the logic   First there are two kinds of inter state migration and the balance between them matters There s the regional kind  where someone from Louisiana moves to say Angelina County or somewhere else in the Deep East In that case you re  on average getting a conservative And then there s the long distance migration that s more commonly discussed in this context You could have a situation where the mechanical growth is coming from the long distance migration  more people moving from northern and coastal cities to Texas cities than in the other direction while the regional migration is more balanced  the same amount of people go LA   gt Angelina County as Angelina County   gt LA  Let s assume for the sake of argument the regional migration and long distance migration are equal In such a situation because you re mixing these pools the majority of in migrants will still be conservative because hypothetically  of the regional ones and  of the long distance ones will be BUT the regional in migrants will simply be swapping out conservative out migrants whereas the  new people who aren t being canceled out by an equal number of out migrants will be disproportionately liberal turning the overall population bluer The second kink is that if the long distance migration is a newer trend the opinions of more conservative transplants from twenty or more years ago will swamp them even though that doesn t reflect what is happening at this moment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here are my predictions  NEW SWING STATES  no particular order   North Carolina  Arizona   Wisconsin  Maine  New Hampshire  Pennsylvania   Georgia  Texas  maybe  Montana  maybe  Alaska  maybe  Minnesota  maybe  Vermont  maybe  Tennessee  maybe   Alabama  if we get election reforms  Mississippi  if we get election reforms  NEW SAFE STATES   Nevada  D  New Mexico  D  more than it is now  Florida  D  if gen xers and millennials retire there   Ohio  R  Iowa  R   Of course anything can change from now until then 
PoliticalDiscussion,Demographics have always been the most important thing Blacks who have been here for  years hispanics and asians vote democrat no matter what Whites vote republican If minorities never had the right to vote republicans would win every time So expect mexico border states with the exception of the south to vote democrat Also more blacks are moving to the south who grew up historically in the US so expect it to slowly swing like South Carolina and georgia 
PoliticalDiscussion,Reddit is a bubble for hating trump so at times it may seem as if everyone in America is against him but that is far from the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea they can but unless it s Beto running it isn t going to do much
PoliticalDiscussion,A bunch of the reasoning  imo is populism about NAFTA and the whole forgotten man thing There used to be tons and tons of smaller shops throughout the state creating widgets for the automakers that all shut down after NAFTA bc they couldn t compete with Mexico on price 
PoliticalDiscussion,The bill still does not give financial support for around  million people that will also need money to continue to shelter in place plus it also does not address those that won t qualify for unemployment so I don t see this bill much for tens of millions of people that will soon be up against the wall in the next few weeks 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m seeing  nationally and  in Michigan    
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there any data about why the migration is happening I know Texas is certainly gaining a larger Dem population 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe  Grab  em by the Pussy Biden has a good shot at Texas even though he isn t quite as vile as Ted Cruz and his sexual assault history is less extensive than trumps
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a matter of  who from CA is moving anecdotally it s inland empire folks
PoliticalDiscussion,No question 
PoliticalDiscussion,Used to be a nickel 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fair point but I just don t see it counteracting the growth in the rest of the state New Hanover Brunswick and Pender counties combined have grown less than  people in the last  years Wake county alone has added over   Wake is not even the fastest growing blue county and there are plenty of others too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cruz was a household name incumbent senator who ran for president and was the last to stay in Beto was a nobody local House rep and he still only lost by   You need to look at the context to understand how impressive this was 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kentucky has shifted red not blue over the past decade you dolt KY went from all blue statewide and control of legislature for decades to barely winning the governorship against the least popular governor in America  Shifting blue 
PoliticalDiscussion,People can easily be reminded    
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see that Which is unfortunate I do think she would be good 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but presumably they will be able to find someone in FL who does not cavort with meth head escorts Presumably 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you re mostly correct but I would argue that by the end of this decade Texas could be more left leaning than a state like Florida Texas median age is very young compared the the US average whereas Florida has one of the oldest populations Plus the Dem primary margins in Texas and Florida suggest to me that Texas Latinos are more left in general than in Florida 
PoliticalDiscussion,I definitely agree During the  midterms the Atlanta suburbs sharply veered to the left Even the exurbs such as Forsyth County went towards the Democrats in double digits I m excited to see how fast my state is changing 
PoliticalDiscussion,is it it really depends where you go    if you re easily mobile and looking for an open minded vibe why not go live in asheville it s like the Boulder CO of the southeast
PoliticalDiscussion,Based on the state s polls and recent elections I definitely think Georgia will be a new swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Texas statewide race margins got a lot closer across the board  except for the governors race  Dems flipped several US House seats as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,one headwind is that there is major mechanical growth in the Wilmington area that looks to be older and coming from SC
PoliticalDiscussion,You must be one of those people not from Michigan who believe there s nothing here but Detroit and then farmland  I m going to correct you in simple terms people leaving Detroit don t leave Michigan As the population of Detroit has decreased other cities like Lansing Kalamazoo Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids have been expanding They also vote reliably Blue Urban centers in Michigan still outvote rural desolation Also EVERY county in Michigan except   and that s a hell of a lot of rural counties  shifted Democratic in  over  Trump counties in  shifted  points Left in   VERY old people tend to vote Republican They re also dying every day People MY age  Millennials  which is right at Michigan s median lean strongly Democrat and are becoming the country s largest voting bloc People younger than me are MUCH more Democratic than Republican AND they are more politically involved than other generations were at their age You are not correct 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see a lot of these posts as wishful thinking The parties adjust over time and it ends up being pretty split overall A lot of these  predictions have more blue areas than red at the end this is contrary to all US history 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot to mention Beto won a majority of native Texans votes
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden doesn t need her 
PoliticalDiscussion,Successful politicians have a short memory 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s  Michigander  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think is a good analysis but I would add  Midwest Rust  Belt voters to that list which isn t really swinging on either the black or progressive vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s  Michigander  
PoliticalDiscussion,They were trending blue before Trump just like rural areas were trending red Trump was just an accelerwnt 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not necessarily The Constution doesn t actually detail how statehood is achieves leaving that to congress Keyword being congress meaning they d need both houses Also democrats arent exactly gunho either The current PR rep is a Republican after all Nobody knows who would get the state and status quo is better then losing multiple seats   PR also may not want it The only poll with above  of voters going statehood was one where the rest boycotted it to a tune of only  turnout Most put statehood at plurality not majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,Utah is going to flip for sure Democrats keep increasing their vote share among the college educated Republicans keep doing better and better among those who are not college educated Utah is the most college educated state in the whole country It will take time but Utah will swing by  
PoliticalDiscussion,If all states go to voting by mail this election Texas and Georgia could flip blue  In many states demographic groups that lean democratic vote in lower percentages than republicans due to many factors including work schedules and poll access Wisconson s Governor today called for sending every registered voter a ballot by mail If that happens Wisconsin will turn back to blue this election  Republican strategists have publicly stated that the more people vote the less likely they are to win in some of the current red states  Mail in ballots would increase the participation rate 
PoliticalDiscussion,In Oklahoma if all the registered democrats would have voted we would have a democratic governor He lost the okc area by a large margin and almost lost tulsa I think  vote difference in that city the rural areas are the only reasons he won But if all the Democrats in tulsa and muskogee would have voted he would have lost by a sizable margin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gillum will not be running again He was found in a hotel high on drugs with a Male prostitute last week  He is married with children  
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats have been pushing hard to make Texas go Purple as of late  People are predicting that if Texas votes blue twice in a row the Republicans will be immediately abandoning the electoral college because now they have literally no reliable big states to count on for EC votes which makes winning  immeasurably harder for them  So Texas and then no states because once Texas is a swing state the EC will be on its deathbed 
PoliticalDiscussion,The US s median age is increasing And birthrates have collapsed to below replacement levels  even among nd generation immigrants  Republicans will continue to win by winning old people who form a larger and larger share of the population to due ever decreasing birthrates 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am going to explain this in simple terms    Democrats rely on votes from big cities   Detroit has lost  people since  including  people in  year due to the financial crisis of    Detroit can no longer out vote the rest of Michigan And they continue to lose population year on year Its simple math And if there is another economic meltdown  which is highly likely due to Coronavirus then Detroit will be emptied even faster   The math disagrees with your assessment Maybe Trump is so unpopular with the Detroit suburbs that Democrats win  more election but after that they are finished 
PoliticalDiscussion,Upstate New York is already very red
PoliticalDiscussion,Armchair analyst basically treat it like a red state now It is also the Swing state Biden and Bernie perform worst in 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to Sean Trende and David Byler  journalists for RCP there has been an increasing trend since  towards Republican control of the rural areas and Democratic control of the cities   Wrap your head around this Michael Dukakis was defeated in a landslide by George H W Bush in  However he still won a higher percentage of rural votes than Hillary Clinton Back then the Democratic party was balanced demographically Now it is quite lopsided Same goes for the Republican party       Democrats will probably flip Texas and Georgia on a new Southern Strategy Then Democrats will be in control for a few years until they either fuck up the economy or a foreign policy issue Democrats have only ever lost the White House in recent memory to foreign crises LBJ bungled Vietnam Carter bungled the Iranian hostage crisis Al Gore and HIllary both won the popular vote so we don t count that as losses 
PoliticalDiscussion,How long until  I like guys who don t get captured turns into  I like guys who don t get wounded  It will happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Evers wouldn t be a good pick at all I d choose Tammy Baldwin if I had to pick someone from Wisconsin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tammy Baldwin won t happen Democrats would risk losing that Senate seat 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except the people leaving for those reasons are more likely to have similarities to the people in the areas that they are moving to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but gov Tom Wolf is pretty moderate and people tend to underestimate how popular Trump is here even in the suburbs and cities  Pennsylvania has generally been pretty moderate put I don t think it is shifting left nearly as fast as the Democratic party is shifting leftward 
PoliticalDiscussion,And to be clear nobody in California is craving a Jeb Bush candidacy  Moderate means different things to different people but a successful GOP candidate in California has to excite people 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is not partisan just betting likelihood  Polls continue to be wrong or erroneously biased  As wrong as they were last time it s unbelievable how everyone regards them as correct now  Biden will be lucky to reach   Absolute landslide  If what you meant is years from now i apologize   no specifics But generally more states will fade from blue as population ages  naturally leans more red combined with blue fatigue setting in from constant alarmism   hysteria by the press sports entertainment We almost can t watch or attend anything anymore without getting drama preached ad nauseum as if we were morons by spoiled knucklehead millionaires claiming victimhood and that we re bad people if we don t immediately agree donate funds   join their boycotts and oppression rallies And the planet is about to bake  we re all gonna go broke or die at the hands of the evil rich and the corporations Even commercials annoyingly blare and blast virtue signaling It is absolutely annoying and wearisome makes you want to retire to an idyllic peaceful Mayberry or some remote cabin  ranch where at least the wildlife is non dysfunctional and better behaved 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s stuff we definitely could ve done but even things like banning travel from Europe and then not thinking to increase the number of federal workers in customs which created a mass of people in super close quarters He doesn t think Over and over we re smacked in the face by his rash stupidity 
PoliticalDiscussion,But those  reliably vote In every election They re often also vocal willing to work for campaigns and they often have family that vote along their views as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Michigander 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t argue for a second that Trump mismanaged this he  did I just think that the economic slowdown was largely unavoidable South Korea could tentatively contain it so far but they have different infrastructures in place due to past pandemic scares the US doesn t including widespread thermal cameras to pinpoint people with fevers out of a crowd 
PoliticalDiscussion,Doubt it A lot of Republicans from Democratic states also move to Texas  and Florida  
PoliticalDiscussion,I just gave a great example What the liberal media should have done was IGNORE him And they should have pounded him with the questions that really mattered and they should not let have ever gotten away with a bullshit response They did none of that Tell me have you seen ONE journalist ask trump how much money  We have made from all of these Chinese Tariffs And then asked him to telk us how HE thinks tariffs work because he clearly does not know  That is just one of a million questions they SHOULD be asking but don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump is an incumbent president He s in a stronger position in  than  unless the economy craters Just rerunning  with small changes in turnout won t win
PoliticalDiscussion, You call it a germ you can call it a flu you can call it a virus You know you can call it many different names I m not sure anybody even knows what it is  President Idiot on March th
PoliticalDiscussion,I just don t agree here I haven t seen bernie able to draw in supporters from other camps nor turn out voters to the degree he needs to even online toxicity aside And yes I m aware that Bernie supporters were more open to warren and Pete early on   but that s exactly the trend They re  open early on and then switch to attack mode as that candidate gains support Less so from bernie himself but certainly that aggressive stance is present in his campaign with David sirota and Nina turner  I hope I am wrong and that they re able to be swung as long as the candidates can show conviction But I think you believe his supporters to be more policy based than I do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would a child born in the next couple days be eligible for the stimulus relief check 
PoliticalDiscussion,Texas and Georgia are both headed towards swing state territory In  Beto lost the senate race to Cruz by only about   and right now Biden is polling dead even with Trump These are two of the most unpopular republicans in the country so I think we should still consider Texas to lean red at least for now However the youth in texas is leaning increaslingly blue and as old people die I expect the state should reach a point of being a true swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Another Georgian here definitely agree
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a waste of time  His statements will not affect trump or any other politicians going forward with handling this pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most sexual assault survivors try to cope by ignoring their assaulter Pretending they don t exist For most people that can be easy to do However when the person who allegedly assaulted you could likely become president for the next  years ignoring your accuser becomes impossible That is why once trump won the nomination all these accusers started coming out They try to get by ignoring what happened but you put a reminder in the white house and it becomes more difficult 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we are at a point that no one is taking anything in the media seriously now But I am waiting for this to come full circle come November
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would anyone want testing for free  Wouldn t they rather just use their own private insurance  s
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I would say nor Cal  the Santa Clara San Fransico and other areas of nor cal Washington and Oregon that and the tech industry have big alt left groups  The groups  among them are people like eco fascists       They are characterized  both by their far left stance when it comes to feminism abortion the environment the economy and the lgbtq as well as their inherent racism and white supremacy  I would say you have to have both to be alt left  There are tons of these people in Nor Cal which is why I stay away from the area  In the tech industry you have all that plus a desire for alternative lifestyles like communes and one woman with many boyfriends  But all in all are social Darwinists and believe whole heartedly in white supremacy  These people are big on Hillary and Elizebeth Warren again both pandered to these groups    Again I m sticking to my religious values and staying away from both political parties  Self reliance family and community is what I believe in 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry but how is anyone taking him seriously Are there people out there that are actually looking to him as a beacon of hope Even after seeing him in any other video that he doesn t perfectly read from a teleprompter At this point he is just another person with opinions while the Media has its attention on those in power to make these changes
PoliticalDiscussion,In all honesty this will not do much even though  like it or not this is    definitely  something he would do  Not saying he did it but I would not put it past him given his behavior towards women in the past  Even  international media   has been covering his creepy behavior for years Before he even announced his candidacy the Times in the UK actually wrote the article I linked above  Even when Biden was vice president people spoke out about his behavior towards women  As to the authenticity of the allegations themselves she seems credible Her role in Biden s campaign staff would have put her in direct contact with Biden at the time They definitely knew each other hence why the Biden team did not try to claim they never met From what I understand there are photos of the two together though I have not seen them myself Her family is also vouching for her saying she told them at the time what had happened She also was not fired from the Biden campaign which rules out the idea that this is a disgruntled ex employee  In summary multiple boxes check out here for a valid claim  I am not one to rush to conclusions but I think something likely did happen  Biden has just behaved so oddly with so many women and girls in the past that I can t put it past him 
PoliticalDiscussion, The point of modern propaganda isn t only to misinform or push an agenda It is to exhaust your critical thinking to annihilate truth   Garry Kasparov
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah no one cares about Joe Bidens Town Hall atm  There s to much else going on eatting their attention 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say his statements have little to no effect because Trump the governors the CDC and the stock market economy are consuming just about all of the political oxygen in the news cycle and will likely continue to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not to be victim blaming here but it seems like there were  many many better opportunities to try to sink him with this than after he s the presumptive nominee and the alternative is someone who has an absolutely abhorrent history in this respect   Like seriously all this can do is risk another term of a Trump presidency which is far worse There were plenty of cleaner candidates on the stage until  weeks ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,This link is to a report on a report of a podcast Here s the link to the article from The Intercept   And a link to a story in this morning s Daily Mail that looks at some of the other surrounding issues and reports on the Biden campaign s categorical denial   One important point Reade said she filed a contemporaneous complaint Where is that report Didn t she keep a copy for herself 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s a small chance he d straight up mock her like that but I think a big reason he got away with insulting McCain was because he was still something of a novelty at that point People know what he s like now he doesn t just do it for attention he s not playing the media he s just a petty bitch   There would still be a ton of redcaps who love it or who disagree with what he said but vote for him anyway but a comment like that would convince a lot of people to stay home 
PoliticalDiscussion,A link to an explanation of the allegations   
PoliticalDiscussion,We literally have Trump as President so your point doesn t stand
PoliticalDiscussion,The tax cuts did not reduce poverty The unemployment has decreased BUT the number of non working citizens has grown every year Trump has been in office   If you own a house in a town without jobs you aren t counted as unemployed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because they have to look good on TV
PoliticalDiscussion,The  trillion is being given to billionaires   Who do you think owns the businesses that people will spend their stimulus checks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nah most people so think that Obama was cool Kamala is not Thats it He has got  it and she don t
PoliticalDiscussion,I m putting money hear   and your allowed to quote me if I m wrong but by November we most likely will have taken care of the carona virus and the economy will be just as good as it was before it hit America And for no reason my prediction for who will win the election would de trump His opponent is inpatient at best and senile at worst and trump has shown to be consistent on polls even through this virus  I mean as in good   If your gonna reply pls be respectful 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Got some sources for this right  Of course   The Republican Bill created a  B slush fund to use at the Administrations discretion without public reporting   The Republican Bill means tested the  payout so that only those earning above  k would get   the Americans who need it the most would have received between nothing and      gt the American people know the crap Nancy Pelosi was trying to stuff into the bill   Crap like the Bill helping you as well as Wall Street billionaires   It s amazing how easily rightwing media can trigger you into distraction and misinform you 
PoliticalDiscussion,To do what They can t empower the VP with legislative powers beyond what is enumerated in the constitution at least not with procedural changes 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s   not at all what I was saying My point is that the black community looks at Kamala Harris and sees someone who is a viscous prosecutor who jailed many many black Americans over non violent crimes  and even blocked evidence that would have granted release on appeals so for that reason alone not really an advocate for the black community Couple that with the fact that she was raised by her  Indian mother who was a working scientist and her speeches about growing up in the struggle just really fall on deaf ears IMO   It s kind of like how Irish people think people who rep being  Irish in America but couldn t tell you if Antrim is in Ireland or Northern Ireland are wack It s just inauthentic She should be proud to be Indian but almost never talks about it because it s not politically useful 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly You can see the general leaning of this sub by the response I got for such a mundane statement  So often I get dismissed and downvoted for being a  fanatical Tumpist  when really it s because the democrats have moved further left than I can get on board with and have made several choices over that past  years that I just can t support  All I m left with is Trump who isn t REALLY a republican and at least he matches SOME of what I believe in 
PoliticalDiscussion,His rallies and speeches were broadcast live uninterrupted every single time They were advertised with countdowns That s pretty insane free media How many speeches and rallies of Clinton s were widely advertised and broadcast uninterrupted Few if any 
PoliticalDiscussion,Many many people who support trump would on board voting tulsi but wouldn t even consider the other candidates   People who don t necessarily like trump but would rather have him over another  establishment type like Hillary or Biden and who also won t vote for someone like Bernie who has praised socialist dictators in the past  regardless of his reasons or intentions for doing so  
PoliticalDiscussion,Are politicians supposed to be attractive Why
PoliticalDiscussion,I m inclined to believe a lot of interstate migration to Texas is conservative  Mostly right leaning  fed up west coasters Similarly Florida gets a lot interstate migration mostly right leaning people from the Northeast 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Trump would have a field day with Tammy  no legged Tammy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao i think its funny how black people are racist towards their own people Yea you light skin blacks arent black enough Yea youre not really black your Jamaican As if us white people really care about how black you are Boy we would segregate you if you were white as a piece of paper but had  black great great grandma get over yourself
PoliticalDiscussion,She s not good looking enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its impossible to predict party trends seversl decades in the future If you told someone in the s that the South would solidly vote Republican for in thr s they would laugh in your face However I would argue that its not necessarily the people changing but the party The South has  stayed  conservative since well forever but the party themselves have changed Similarly we could see shifts in party tones although I think Democrats and the GOP have solidly stayed loyal to a message and won t switch over Perhaps we might see more environmentalist Republicans as climate change heats up and crops fail in solidly rural states I think that inner cities will continue to liberalize and become more progressive but suburban areas will stay moderate meaning we will have moderate Democrats from suburban districts and progressives like AOC from solidly urban counties However I think Senators will stay mostly moderate since the suburbs usually outnumber the inner city   However this trens could reverse as right now we are seeing the opposite of white flight as suburbanites move back into cities and face high rent while suburban areas become poorer This could swing the tide in favor of a progressive Democrat party unless they redistrict the lines to gerrymander the cities Similarily Republicand might also favor  very progressive district and  Republican district rather than  someone moderate liberal district and  solidly Republic district By doing so they stratify moderate Democrats leaving their voice unheard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,As in it s not election time 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But for now the suburbs of St Louis and Kansas City are pretty red  Are they Clinton still won the County by over  points 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that s true Depends what you both do and so forth Research triangle no good 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just Hillary did an especially bad job campaigning or marketing to Michigan  Understatement Along with Wisconsin Michigan was one of the states her campaign siphoned money from to spent in cities like New Orleans because she was afraid of losing the popular vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not a good job market and very expensive to live there
PoliticalDiscussion,  Swing   Texas Wisconsin Michigan Minnesota Pennsylvania Arizona Georgia Maine New Hampshire    New Safe   Virginia D  Ohio R  Florida R  Iowa R  Colorado D  New Mexico D 
PoliticalDiscussion,No meta discussion All comments containing meta discussion will be removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where do you think the people leaving Detroit are going Ohio Detroit doesn t need to outvote the rest of Michigan by itself What you should be looking at is Wayne Oakland Macomb Ingham and Washtenaw county as a bloc 
PoliticalDiscussion,He found a vehicle to use that didn t corrupt him as much as taking PAC money He is beholden to no one accepting  at a time It took him those  years to find a way to cash in with out being corrupted He got rich in  and he did it again if he were completely altruistic he wouldn t have ran in  In  he proved a point he put together a movement but that movement is simply not large enough to get him the nomination It would take a set of circumstances that were off the charts for him to get the nomination Progressive Democrats for the most part aren t quite as progressive as Bernie would like them to be he has a large following but isn t electable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Living in Utah a lot of people from the coasts are moving here because of the great economy and quality of life I can expect Utah to go blue sometime soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would think so but the tribalism is fierce 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does it matter when he s holding up federal medical supplies to the entire state 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Michigonian  Ug my eyes Michigander please  
PoliticalDiscussion,Also the D is down for the Ds DDDD 
PoliticalDiscussion,I just want to point out that every voting aged citizen does NOT get a relief check College students and other adult dependents such as the disabled are not eligible for relief and those claiming them do not get the  credit either Huge hole in the bill leaving out some of those affected most 
PoliticalDiscussion,Voters Voters are choosing Biden Stop blaming the DNC   After Biden s v performance against Sanders he  increased his margins of victory in the next round of primaries   Unfortunately Sanders and his supporters were expecting Biden to implode He didn t The people have spoken   And as I said Biden could very well lose the election His campaign hasn t been impressive   But the best thing Biden has going for him is   Trump People are tired of the drama and want a return to normal Nothing is more boring and normal than Joe   Don t believe he s in a fundamentally good position check out the averages at RCP 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But those  reliably vote  At least once  D
PoliticalDiscussion,Ohio is losing its young people to either Cleveland Columbus or Cincinnati or they re just leaving the state outright I do think it will be a lean red state but the cities will still give Democrats a chance in some races But I think eventually in areas like Youngstown the GOP will make ground 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is backed up by data though It s undeniable that meat production constitutes a large portion of methane in the atmosphere I still eat meat and acknowledge this to be true 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt unless the economy craters  So like right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,assuming we ll be a republic in the s   
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie wouldn t be a bad choice It would almost definitely unite the Moderates with the Progressives 
PoliticalDiscussion,This I certainly get and it s easy to see how Trump crafted a victory in Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania making promises to return than manufacturing to the states There are a ton of problems with that of course and I feel like we re in a global economy whether we wanted one or not and that return to all American manufacturing ship has sailed 
PoliticalDiscussion,The parties will slowly change to changing demographics    Republicans have always needed to appeal to Hispanic voters but the racist arm has stopped that occurring outside of Cubans      The pandemic looks likely to wipe out a few hundred thousand to a couple of million predominately Republican voters    This will accelerate the urgency for the party to reform a little towards appeal to Hispanic voters  less tolerance for the racists     It s a good fit the religious family values   small business aspects align well with many parts of the community         That shift will slowly change safe swing states at some point very likely by  
PoliticalDiscussion,Lgbt health is still at risk because Biden wants to expand the ACA which is limited by religious liberty laws that can deny care Most of the time the business just pays a waver and then they can get that care through the ACA but there s examples where they don t sign the waiver and then those people can t get care And if they are in a Republican state then they can t get care through the ACA really either And mental health is expanded but not the full mandatory it needs to be 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ummm no  Thats not how any of this works   I m not sure what else to say here honestly as its obviously universal using the standard accepted definition of universal  Universal doesn t mean it covers everything  In which case no country on the planet is universal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see this just being ignored Is she telling the truth Maybe There s almost certainly no hard evidence one way or the other But it s so easy to dismiss her  on account of politically biased and somewhat crazy  and since that would be very convenient both for Biden and Democratic voters I think that s what everybody s going to end up doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would probably look like this   Landlord applies for loan grant from the government    Government grants funds for  months rent   Renter doesn t have to pay rent for  months   Another way   Renter applies for  grant to freeze rent    Government pays landlord directly   Lastly   Government creates agency to talk to landlords on behalf of renter   Agency has rent payments  frozen  but spread out over remaining payment or renegotiated for a modified lease 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhhh Singapore doesn t support all lgbt health that would make the system not universal If it s discriminating and refusing to serve that group 
PoliticalDiscussion,Excuse me for the pester but I dropped off caring keeping up with politics after  Super Tuesday  What has Bernie s direct message response been 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you asked the people who are voting for him why they take it seriously 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you go back to all the prior elections  I looked until the mid s they are all winning by similar margins except one where Dems won by about    Were they all corporate Dems going back decades 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you have an example 
PoliticalDiscussion, Bernie probably doesn t care because he s already lost 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honest to god not even saying this in bad faith is there any source which specifies why  wouldn t be covered 
PoliticalDiscussion,The all powerful DNC isn t doing a very good job hiding him if he s giving speeches interviews town halls and Jimmy Kimmel apearances all week 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you should say that to Biden s overwhelming black support 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And Bernie is a guy who is in a position to do something but instead skips a critical vote to continue his dying dead campaign  He didn t vote for the first version of the stimulus bill that all Democrats in attendance voted against because of the severe lack of oversight issues present in it It was not critical at all      He voted for the stimulus bill that passed after it was changed That was the one that actually mattered and what he was there for      Take some time to actually research the matter please 
PoliticalDiscussion,The cities  excluding Fort Worth have all been blue for decades and that s where the most migration is actually happening Dallas only continues to become more and more left leaning as more people keep coming here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok so we are now using a definition of Universal that isn t commonly accepted and therefore you are redefining it to exclude Germany and Singapore for example 
PoliticalDiscussion,considered to be universal and being universal are different things Singapore also has massive issues with one of my complaints there with lgbt people
PoliticalDiscussion,Also Biden specifically mentions covering lgbt health its on his lgbt issues page not healthcare But its there Mental health issues are also covered by Bidens plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t really disagree with any of your bullet points   The democrats definitely have set themselves up in a place where they  have to assume she s telling the truth   Credibility issues Waits years and years Gets strung along by someone Hmmm   who does that remind me of 
PoliticalDiscussion,NC is a shit state for anyone working in public education which my girlfriend does She can get almost a  k raise in almost any state we move to
PoliticalDiscussion,What paperwork  We just gave the banks how many trillions of tax dollars specifically so they can get through this without collapsing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I mean there is  one story about him that s making the news 
PoliticalDiscussion,Finally there is someone who understands that this is an option We dont have to go into a full single payer system to achieve what we want 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie is doing round tables with coronavirus experts He s been extremely active during this time while Biden has been hiding until opinions are made that he come confirm after all relevancy has passed 
PoliticalDiscussion, Bernie has been holding virtual round tables and conferences and meetings with experts and other congresspeople almost every single day  
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean why not A huge chunk of the US economy is in a stand still rn 
PoliticalDiscussion,It sounds like you understand it just fine What s the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fyi Germany has  uninsured Singapore   and both are considered universal 
PoliticalDiscussion,A comment on the obvious several weeks past it s relevance  Sounds like the Biden signature to me 
PoliticalDiscussion, fart noise     I think that s as reasonable an argument as you re making 
PoliticalDiscussion,Am I the only one tired of the whole Russian thing The U S and Russia are at war in at least  different countries Yemen Syria and Iraq Pushing the Russian narrative really misplaces blame on our politicians democrats and republicans alike 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you pick joe over Bernie your endorsing racism
PoliticalDiscussion,The  coverage doesn t make it not universal Germany has  uninsured  Are they not universal  The number is  in Singapore   Not universal either Luxembourg 
PoliticalDiscussion,Idk if I have a really good plan or what but I don t pay anywhere near that much for insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty much
PoliticalDiscussion,It gives more credence to those pushing these issues within DC but as a private citizen I can t imagine that it ll have any kind of impact on either Trump or other politicians right now Right now you have Trump ignoring scientists doctors and other experts on what to do He is a seeking for this  beautiful timeline of opening the country up by Easter despite evidence stating how horrific of an idea that is When you have a President already ignoring expert opinion what is one more voice in the room Right now Joe Biden as a private citizen is just another voice in the room I m more interested to hear these points from those who can do something Someone like Cuomo for example who is quickly emerging as a leader on this whole thing 
PoliticalDiscussion, As president Biden will stop this reversal of the progress made by Obamacare And he won t stop there He ll also build on the Affordable Care Act with a plan to insure more than an estimated  of Americans Here s how   from      His plan also doesn t go over premiums or copays which under his plan will still exist which means people wont be able to afford them and will not have healthcare His plan super lacks for lgbt health as its based off obamacare and religious liberty laws have allowed businesses to deny health services mostly to lgbt peoples and women And theres also a lack on the mental health front which obamacare did improve but still lacks far behind 
PoliticalDiscussion,You took so many incorrect logical leaps there I m not sure it s worth responding because you ve probably already made up you mind and are being deliberately intellectually dishonest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Some were literally saying that he was dead It s just another childish line of attack from a group that s flailing at this point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because at the current moment there s no other way to guarantee that cost will not be a barrier to someone receiving care testing for coronavirus which is particularly concerning because if someone doesn t they could further spread coronavirus to others  Now if we were in Biden s optimal healthcare system which would be universal health care where everyone is either on a private plan or on a public option plan  you could pass a law saying that all COVID tests treatments must be covered with a  copay It accomplishes the same task incentives people to get tested treated for COVID and helps minimize the risk to others However we re not in Biden s optimal UHC system we re in our horrible mess of a system so the easiest thing to advocate for right now is a law that just pays everyone s COVID testing treatment    Stipulation that Biden s plan doesn t mandate insurance so you d get about  of the population at risk to not be able to afford his healthcare plan I m making the assumption here that Biden actually does want  of people covered and would hammer out the details of this later to ensure everyone is covered 
PoliticalDiscussion,So serious answer the projections of healthcare costs that insurance firms would incur aren t so precisely measured yet The entire premise of insurance is to hedge known risk among a pool of players We don t know the total risks and dangers or treatments and so billing in the standard way won t work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the other  comes from a Medicaid extension but yeah go off 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is a major component of modern politics   Trump is president dude Don t act like substance and reality matter to the electorate I care about that stuff you care about that it s important politics involves much more than that especially in our current climate Remember that guy that lost a presidential election over a silly face in a photo Or the guy who yelped in front of reporters  Btw I really like your username 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am trying to think of how the situation could be any uglier    Joe Biden has a terrible history with physical boundaries Yea fondling hair and whispering into someone s ear isn t the same as straight up sexual assault but it s a lot easier for people to go  yea that makes sense  At the very least it s terrible optics   On the other hand even people that complained about his behavior in the past said that it wasn t sexual    The accuser has some credibility issues in terms of her politics Some of her quotes about russia aren t just positive they re like weird crazy lady comments Also the only people she told are her family members    On the other hand victims of sexual assault often have conflicting stories And this happened a while ago And she did mention that there was more to the story when she initially made her accusations She didn t want to come out because of harassment So there s enough there to make it hard to be completely dismissive    This could not come at a worse time He s almost the presumptive democratic nominee I can t decide if this is the best or worst time to sabotage a biden s campaign if she is being dishonest Surely early on when there were other candidates that could beat him would ve been a better time But at the same time maybe she thought she wouldn t need to speak up because he was behind And maybe it makes more sense for a victim to be irrational   What are democratic supporters even supposed to do They ve set themselves up to always believe women and criticize republicans about their members poor actions  e g Trump and his accusers  To the point that they really jumped the gun on Franken which some people now say they regret It s poor optics to not take this seriously Not to mention how many people will be put off by voting for someone they think is a rapist Republicans tend to fall in line and even then they had problems with Trump    On the other hand maybe it s more politically savvy to ignore it  out of sight out of mind If they actually do the responsible thing and take it seriously it could give the impression that there s something there    Also doesn t help how gleeful a lot of Sanders supporters seem to be and trying to their best to push a certain agenda    How does something like this not get vetted The man has been vice president and has been around for a very long time Surely there would be more accusations for someone that thinks it s ok to just waltz up to someone and well yea    Honestly all round terrible situation 
PoliticalDiscussion, only cover  of America and there would still be an unknown percentage     That s   Not how percentages work 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the remaining  is supposed to be crazy people that actively resist getting insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure that between Biden Sanders or Trump you ll find that
PoliticalDiscussion,He s been fighting for amendments on the cv relief bill You re not paying attention enough attention 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s by design I have you seen how bad his cognitive performance has deteriorated The DNC is trying to isolate his presence as much as possible and sadly at a time when you need the nominee out in the front lines fighting this crisis 
PoliticalDiscussion,He supports a hybrid healthcare system where everyone can have coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely serious In a global pandemic we probably want to be more efficient right So that signals that he thinks single payer is more efficient But yet he doesn t want it for the day to day   If other options were better at getting healthcare to the masses in an efficient way wouldn t he advocate for those options at this time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really You don t think that is ridiculous as well as impossible to do the paper work  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What makes COVID more important than the insulin crisis  It is a far greater danger to people and the economy  One analysis might say we ll continue just fine with our average problems  standard flu insulin opiods cancer etc   But we might not continue just fine with covid    So the response is usually proportional to the impact  Everyone will have a different opinion on how strongly to react to something to avoid an impact  But in general weighing cost vs benefit consequence is a pretty common result when deciding how to respond to something  We don t send in the army over shoplifting because it isn t necessary   Doesn t mean we like shoplifting just that the response is in proportion to the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes there s a link for an article about it for people that read the top of the thread 
PoliticalDiscussion,And Bernie is a guy who is in a position to do something but instead skips a critical vote to continue his dying dead campaign At this point I ll take Joe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Meh he doesn t need to say a damned thing until he s confirmed as the nominee though It s his to lose and I don t think he s fool enough to chance throwing it away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine how bad Bernie is if he s getting creamed by an absentee candidate
PoliticalDiscussion,They re also the ones who started the bullshit dementia smear At this point they re just helping Russia I started blocking and unfollowing anyone who says  Biden has dementia  Meanwhile Trump can t even remember the governor of Michigan s name
PoliticalDiscussion,A public option with no income min or max fulfills the conditions for universal coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have never seen a journalist ask him where the tariff money is    Journalists acted like prosecutors when they went after Hillary in  Please don t deny reality 
PoliticalDiscussion,In a sub that is about discussing politics that answer is yes we are under the premise that reality and legislation both matter The problem is that other people treat it like it s about competing fan clubs 
PoliticalDiscussion,But you have to spend several thousand a year for private health insurance then several more for deductibles After trump got elected mine nearly doubled and this year I finally just let it go because my wife and I  no kids were gonna be paying  K before we saw any benefit from the shittiest possible plan Figured we d save the cash and have it next year Now this shit happens Shits fucked yo 
PoliticalDiscussion,The worst part is he hasn t been hiding his handling of the crisis has just been that ineffective and un noteworthy 
PoliticalDiscussion,His option isn t universal  Even his own website claims it would only cover  of America and there would still be an unknown percentage who would be too poor to effectively use whatever insurance they have His proposal is a rebranded ACA perhaps with a few improvements 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like what  And can you give me numbers here  As far as I m aware the only people who wouldn t be insured are those actively refusing to be insured      Biden s health care plan is surprisingly liberal It goes way beyond the ACA and enrolls millions of people in government health care including everyone who was denied Medicaid because they live in a Republican hold out state that refused the ACA s Medicaid expansion It auto enrolls low income people whenever they have an interaction with the government It allows anyone even those with employer provided insurance to join a government plan  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I just gave a great example What the liberal media should have done was IGNORE him  That is ridiculous Journalist aren t in the business to ignore news maker   gt And they should have pounded him with the questions that really mattered once he became president and they should not let have ever gotten away with a bullshit response  I don t know if you noticed he hasn t made himself available to journalists outside of Fox News all that often When they got a chance to ask like the NBC guy recently he shut them down by calling them names and then take away their chance to speak One on one interviews usually has rules otherwise it wouldn t happen Journalists aren t prosecutors If their questions don t get them anywhere other than bull shit answer they move on Audiences want them to move on    gt have you seen ONE journalist ask trump how much money  We have made from all of these Chinese Tariffs And then asked him to telk us how HE thinks tariffs work because he clearly does not know  Tariffs questions were asked all the time All you can get from him were nonsense Once again journalist aren t proescutors 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t have to pay my land lord and my land lord doesn t have to pay the bank   I mean yes  That s exactly how it would work  Which part confuses you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are we pretending that substance matters over media coverage and public image in American elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because there is a difference between a global pandemic the likes of which the USA hasn t experienced in maybe  years and complete healthcare coverage Is this a serious question 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are we pretending that meme wasn t a malicious attack that only Sanders supporters cared about They were literally acting like he was dead 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not free your insurance covers it You paid for your insurance Without that insurance you pay for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but insurance will  always find a way to fuck with you over it unless it s explicitly listed by the government board as required to be covered 
PoliticalDiscussion,How would you freeze rent for  months  I don t have to pay my land lord and my land lord doesn t have to pay the bank   Biden is a joke and doesn t even deserve a voice
PoliticalDiscussion,Hopefully it comes full circle in June and Biden s out before he can throw the election to Trump Now is his time to shine and no matter how hard he s trying Trump looks better even with his disastrous mismanagement   I m not saying Trump is better I m saying he is working the situation to benefit himself far more effectively  
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems that a lot of Biden haters are popping up  I do not see Bernie doing any town halls  Come November I want to put someone in the WH who actually understands this problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why was Reade s twitter in  very positive of Biden then 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kinda crazy to see how this virus is sucking almost all of the air entirely out of the the Democratic primary and Joe Biden in general Haven t heard his name in a very long time compared to back in February He almost comes off as struggling to keep the upcoming election relevant lately 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure but his plans for getting to  universal still leave huge gaps for people who just can t afford the private insurance system And we saw how Medicaid expansion went last time around 
PoliticalDiscussion,He really doesn t his  universal plan still leaves Americans uninsured and doesn t cover critical health aspects 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well then why does he support single payer for COVID but not otherwise If it s  free that means it s being paid by the government so single payer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you for this Many people seem to forget that a public option is a form of UHC 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Where s Joe Biden meme is all you need to know He s there his online outreach is terrible Bernie could not have hoped for better circumstances considering he s been all over the internet from the start 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did you forget his first big moment where he mocked the disabled reporter and the Gold Star family  
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing will happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly Reade went to Time s Up in January for their help in putting out her story in a safe manner At that time Biden slipped in polls and if this was out there he might drop out It appears that Time s Up strung her along until earlier this month when they said they could not help her at all She then dropped the story on her own  One of Biden s senior advisors Anita Dunn served as Time s Up s managing director until February Time s Up never disclosed their ties to Reade 
PoliticalDiscussion,He supports universal not single payer 
PoliticalDiscussion,The lying relic that sexually assaults people and lies about wanting to cut entitlements isn t going to be the one to motivate people to do and be better throughout this ordeal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I find it interesting that he supports universal healthcare when it comes to the coronavirus yet opposes it for everything else  What makes COVID more important than the insulin crisis and all the other crises of healthcare in the US  I just am fascinated by the fact that all these people are now suddenly in favor of the policies Bernie has been fighting for over  years yet they simultaneously opposed him on these policies less than a month ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden finally came out of hiding 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the testing were already free he wouldn t have to argue for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did biden have a town hall  I haven t seen any news reports on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,K
PoliticalDiscussion,Preventative care usually is free under private insurance   for effort there 
PoliticalDiscussion,What if he began to commend companies like Ford and New Balance  and many more for their contributions to the medical equipment shortage   I think the most important thing for any candidate to do right now would be to give credit and support to those who are pushing this recovery along Maybe highlight that the American people will be resilient after this dies down 
PoliticalDiscussion,They don t Biden s statements have largely lacked any substance at all He speaks in empty platitudes without really elaborating on his talking points      I don t want to pretend this is abnormal for politicians but that doesn t change the fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden is also  so he needs to be dodging corona
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What makes COVID more important than the insulin crisis and all the other crises of healthcare in the US  Diabetes isn t contagious
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think he ll win either tbh but canceling the remaining primaries in the middle of a national emergency is   not  going to untie the party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah so the ruling was that you couldn t impose a federal mandate forcing a firm to cover the cost of abortion which is just a continuation of the precedent set by the Hyde amendment The ruling came with the justification that they could alternatively still get insurance that wasn t tied to their work which they can In fact with a public option they d literally be able to just get the public option and negotiate out a higher pay since they re not on the firm s insurance plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,The people spreading those memes aren t acting in good faith anyway
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I m saying Biden might try but he s not winning in that aspect 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dr Ford was way more credible to me She never said anything as weird as this lady s frankly bizarre praise of Putin
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I doubt that any of them are going to involve him leaving the bunker  Unlike Trump he seems to be actually following social distancing 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean I m a Bernie supporter but at this point he d have to win every remaining state by a greater amount than he won his home state It s just not happening
PoliticalDiscussion,Had me all the way until that last paragraph   Shame really 
PoliticalDiscussion,That for sure wasn t a good look at the last debate but when this dies down and we take a look back at  trillion in bailouts there will be a lot more people resonating with his complaints Not saying that ll matter in the primary though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Instead on voting debating legislation in the senate   way to go Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did he talk about how many fingers he used 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  It highlighted what is best about him his raw humanity  The clip of him talking about the horror of losing a loved one and not being able to be with them as they pass was the biggest moment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is this a joke Biden s statements were full of platitudes and givens After being absent for a week he turns up and says  We have to take care of the cure   that will make the problem worse no matter what   I m sorry what    
PoliticalDiscussion,Singapore is definitely considered Universal  And no Germany does not have  coverage not does Luxembourg for the same reason that  would be uninsured under Bidens plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,We have okay pretty good insurance and were out of pocket   last year altogether You shouldn t make universal statements and comments unless you understand the full spectrum of people that an issue encompasses I have and continue to not get tests and procedures done because I know I can t afford it I live in pain every day from conditions that could be corrected surgically I just can t afford it
PoliticalDiscussion, gt his name  Swing and a miss  Gretchen Whitmer 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t remember his name  Gretchen Whitmer shockingly is not a man  P
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Asides from that every day he stays in the race is another day taken away from focusing on Trump It s a waste of time and he said he wouldn t do this again which makes it all the more disappointing  Don t forget that it is another day that Joe cannot be coordinating and fundraising with the party and building out a general election operation 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt having conversations with front line healthcare workers or have Ron Klien talk   Anything other than that bookshelf background to diversify his content output 
PoliticalDiscussion,People complaining and asking for Biden to show leadership and be present But when he does people don t care Damned if you do damned if you don t
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The  coverage doesn t make it not universal Germany has  uninsured  Are they not universal     Incorect Germany has  of citizens uninsured     The number is  in Singapore   Not universal either   Singapore does not have universal healthcare The government has written boatloads of laws that strictly control the price of healthcare to the point where even the poorest citizens can normally afford care If the US had Singapore s laws healthcare would not be a debate in this country    gt Luxembourg  Luxembourg guarantees all citizens health insurance either through the government or any employer  whichever plan is better  When one changes jobs they have the option to switch to the government plan or to the plan of their new employer Approximately   of Luxembourg s citizens are uninsured  These individuals have simply not bothered to enroll on the government plan after losing their employer s plan Since you are required to do this while inside the country this is most likely the percentage of Luxembourg s population living in other parts of the EU and as such see no reason to pay for something when they may never return to their country again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Vote by mail is extremely possible Really what would you say if Trump suggested canceling the general election before California votes for  public safety    I don t think we ll agree on the latter point I don t think there is any way Biden will beat Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am young I am not poor And I don t know why the exchange is relevant because I get my insurance through my employer But I still see how much I pay for it in my paystubs and it s barely noticeable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhh Sanders has been dominating social media outside of Trump and Biden memes Also wasn t Sanders on CNN a few nights ago He is getting coverage as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are either really young or poor or live in a state with a good exchange Ours was very manageable at around  month before trump then all of the competition left the marketplace and we were stuck with one provider It makes it much harder being independent contractors 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe who

PoliticalDiscussion, gt edit And Joe Biden seems to be broadcasting from home on the one hand trying to set an example for Americans to stay home but on the other hand handicapping himself as news organizations don t want to run more video of Joe Biden with the same bookshelf background because it isn t attention grabbing after one or two videos Biden s best bet for attention may be having press conferences in front of hospitals and the like bemoaning Trump s performance  I favor the idea that is out there for him to be having conversations with front line healthcare workers or have Ron Klien talk to him about what is happening 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean I don t remember his name and part of me considers myself better informed than Trump at times 
PoliticalDiscussion,That makes Bernie sound so much worse tbh but this was never going to be easy fo Bernie to begin with  and no it is not because Americans are too stupid to listen to Bernie  Also iirc Bernie s answer to all of this stuff at the last debate was  Millionaires and Billionaires and Biden dominated that portion of the debate Maybe a majority of people don t want to listen to Bernie complain about the heath system when a lot of the blame for the current issue is due to congress shortcomings 
PoliticalDiscussion,It won t be affected 
PoliticalDiscussion,No he hasn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,That shit is not in the news outside of lunatic fringe rags on the left and right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty good summary of the situation This is terrible to say but it s happening at the perfect time for Biden s campaign Covid is sucking the media attention dry   Hell this story is being pushed harder by Sanders supporters than right wing media   All that being said it seems odd that her story changed from touchy to full on sexual assault I think that s where a lot of people are attacking her credibility   Furthermore Obama s team vetted him for VP and they were notoriously meticulous about everyone they picked I find it hard to believe this would get past them    gt What are democratic supporters even supposed to do They ve set themselves up to always believe women and criticize republicans about their members poor actions  e g Trump and his accusers  To the point that they really jumped the gun on Franken which some people now say they regret  I fully believe this is part of why Kirsten Gillibrand s campaign failed miserably Go scour the liberal blogs she is not liked for what she did to Franken These scorched Earth tactics she used and Democrats are awful   These issues demand investigations not media outrage 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t want to call it because of the preliminary reports I want to call it because the result is clear and there s a plague in which no one can safely vote  Asides from that every day he stays in the race is another day taken away from focusing on Trump It s a waste of time and he said he wouldn t do this again which makes it all the more disappointing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The unemployment has decreased BUT the number of non working citizens has grown every year Trump has been in office   The only way that could be true is if the total population increased When I say  reduced poverty I mean reduced poverty  rates     gt If you own a house in a town without jobs you aren t counted as unemployed  Why would this percentage change 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t really get your disagreement   When do you think the Spanish flu happened   As for you point  yes anyone arguing in good faith thinks that and how I usually take it also But to that end anyone arguing in good faith and supporting the idea should work to find something better than free because it s what is at the crux of the argument It s why  universal is a much better word This isn t about saving people money it s about saying healthcare is a right and thus a governments responsibility to provide it to people 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt At this point he is just another person with opinions  He s gonna be the nominee dude It s obvious you don t like him  not that I blame you I don t either really but this statement is nonsense He has a wide lead and unless Biden literally catches Coronavirus and dies Bernie does not have a realistic path to close it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Every fucking US intelligence agency said it s happening How the hell can you possibly say there is no evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,At least it will put a stop to the  where s Joe Biden memes right     Right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cool that s not how democracies work You don t get to call an election halfway through because you like the preliminary reports

PoliticalDiscussion,I find it interesting how many people do not know that  universal healthcare and  single player healthcare are not synonyms Universal healthcare just means everyone has access to healthcare The original idea of Obamacare was to achieve universal healthcare The fact he is pushing universal healthcare has literally nothing to do with Sanders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Call me crazy but having  at least  of Americans insured would be a great start This can be a gradual process I d like have the foundation to support universal care in place We still don t specifically know how Sanders will set his MA system up We are all in the unknown with this 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean yea lol that s a big thing but I was Moe talking about the hobby lobby case where birth control and lgbt health services aren t govern through insurance And then following that server all groups coming forward and saying they also would not provide those and they wouldn t sign the exclusion form that would let the ACA cover those people because they are still allowing those things to be given to their employees

PoliticalDiscussion,We re already last half the states voting and Bernie as it stand now has a   chance of getting the majority of pledged delegates    
PoliticalDiscussion,Importantly the ACA makes a number of concessions regarding potentially controversial services such as abortion First under the Hyde Amendment which Congress has passed in some version each year since  federal funding may not be used to cover the cost of abortion except in cases of rape incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered  Guttmacher Institute   President Obama confirmed that the ACA was not intended to upset this longstanding precedent and issued an Executive Order indicating that the current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion funding would be maintained and extended to the health insurance Exchanges    Thus although the ACA pro vides premium or cost sharing subsidies to help individuals and families afford the cost of insurance these subsidies may not be used to purchase coverage for abortion beyond the types contemplated by the Hyde Amendment If subsidy recipients desire a plan with more extensive abor tion coverage they may select one if available but federal subsidy funds as to its constitutionality and still facing a number of other challenges Ethical Perspectives         ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES  MARCH  must be carefully segregated  Kaiser Family Foundation  KFF    Impor tantly however such a plan may not be readily available since the ACA permits states to prohibit plans in their Exchanges from providing abor tion coverage  KFF   In states that choose not to exercise this discre tion at least one plan in each Exchange must not provide coverage for abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions  KFF   Finally the ACA prohibits abortion coverage from being required as part of the essential health benefits package  KFF   III THE EMPLOYER MANDATE AND PREVENTIVE

PoliticalDiscussion,  gt I m sorry but how is anyone taking him seriously   He is basically the nominee for Democrats right now     gt  Even after seeing him in any other video that he doesn t perfectly read from a teleprompter    I watched him last night and he sounds like a normal human being     gt At this point he is just another person with opinions while the Media has its attention on those in power to make these changes     xB  Joe isn t a Senator or Representative so he can t really make changes right now Aren t presidential candidates just people with opinions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those religious liberty actions happened under Obama and cool so those copays would be too much for me so I don t have healthcare 
PoliticalDiscussion,Too bad all that  all over the internet stuff doesn t create votes Bernie isn t in this anymore That part is effectively over This is a general election race right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Old people don t just become Republican That s a myth Mostly people keep their political leanings throughout their lives and Millennials and younger are heavily Democrat

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The second is that she initially hoped that Biden would drop out but now that his nomination seemed inevitable she felt as though she had to speak out  Lets pull right from the Republican playbook If it was true she should have reported it then Otherwise she s probably just a liar Moving on   That should be our response politically Oh and he s running against the Pussy Grabber in Chief  From a criminal and moral standpoint this should probably be investigated If he s found guilty  within Statute of Limitations  throw his ass in jail Moving on If he is found innocent move on  Biden is certainly problematic with his physical boundaries This is no secret It s certainly problematic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao  The president openly breaking laws during a pandemic and the dems giving away their chance to remove this asshole from the White House by voting for this fool  
PoliticalDiscussion,Neither Biden nor Trump are gifted speakers and both have forgotten important people s names 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has tons of gross accusations over the years Anita Hill debacles and the photos of him touch people were one of the first things he had to address if he lauched his White House bid  It was ignored and so was Bloombergs accusations  I m not really sure this will do anything now    So if voter were okay Joe Biden dismissing Anita Hill I m not sure if this would have kill his campagin  Bloomberg got third  he got away with so much shit      gt The second is that she initially hoped that Biden would drop out but now that his nomination seemed inevitable she felt as though she had to speak out   She could have killed Biden s campagin she had alleged this sooner Imagine she said during Iowa or South Carolina Now it will be ignored due to COVID outbreak 
PoliticalDiscussion,At some point you have to draw the line and then bail someone out If you don t pay the landlord he can t pay his debts and so and and so forth 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m saying there would be people within that  that  technically would be insured but  realistically not be 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are seeing your own bias 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I had to guess I would assume it would simply still be too costly for some Americans But understand that s a guess  However the  numeric is from Joe s own election page   so unless Biden himself is trying to downplay his coverage that is an undeniable number 
PoliticalDiscussion,Any talk of  equivalence when it comes to politics in this decade is only meant to suppress the enthusiasm to vote which favors trump  Hillary would not have led us this way There are s of thousands of deaths coming that could have been prevented with ANYONE else running the white house 
PoliticalDiscussion,More like not making the news 
PoliticalDiscussion,TIL if a country guarantees you can get a flu shot but nothing else that country has universal healthcare If it doesn t cover all health aspects for all people it s not universal 
PoliticalDiscussion,You realize that Fox News and The Times are both owned the same company  News Corp and person  Rupert Murdoch right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I m well aware of the facts Let s get one thing straight every vote matters Why did the first version fail You said it yourself literally every other Democrat who didn t have potebtially have Covid voted What makes Bernie better than them Why should he not have to go and cast his vote Why does he get to rely on everyone else to do the work For a man running on an ideological platform not being there is pretty antithetical  Take time to actually think about the matter please 
PoliticalDiscussion,Someone like Booker could have also been accused False accusations do exist sadly The problem is that the Democrats have developed this ridiculous  always believe the victim  standard which keeps leaving them with egg on their face and yet refuse to learn that you can t take every single accusation  regardless of what be it sexual assault or some form of hate crime or whatever and treat it as fact This isn t gonna derail Biden s campaign and he s lucky that it s come out now rather than earlier since sometime after Iowa and before South Carolina would ve straightup ended him imo But it will serve to expose the Democrats for a good degree of hypocrisy on this issue it will make it harder to attack Trump on his own record of sexual assault and it may very well contribute to them losing the election  Overall Democrats are gonna need to do some soul searching and stop treating every single accusation as if it were a fact Otherwise they will keep being forced into situations where they either can t hold themselves to their own standards or end up pushing a narrative which turns out to be nonsense later down the line and that s always gonna lead to bad optics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden is a rapist 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is lgbt health 
PoliticalDiscussion,imagine not knowing what power media has in our elections still  
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure but there has also been a fundamental shift in how they need to run their campaign They can t hold events he shouldn t be going to hospitals or meeting with patients The best they can do is social media campaigns at this point They are being forced to throw out the old playbook The only other thing I can think of is television appearances of which he has done at least one 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt as well as impossible to do the paper work   What about  you get a mortgage holiday for a few weeks and don t charge rent for that period creates impossible paperwork   A mortgage holiday is already a thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a Trump or Sanders supporter that is extremely upset about about Biden having the nomination pretty much locked up so she is using this to try to derail the nomination From her Twitter she seems like a Sanders supporter but she tweeted at Trump last year pushing him to investigate Biden for Burisma so maybe she also likes Trump  The same thing happened to Kavanaugh where you had one very credible allegation and then the floodgates started opening with all sorts of fake accusations coming out against Kavanaugh    Believe Woman shouldn t mean  Believe woman if they tell you the earth is flat 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only reasonable response at this point is to wait for her story to be vetted by journalists which the respectable media organizations are no doubt doing right now  The only thing having this plastered all over the evening news before any serious vetting would accomplish is getting Biden smeared with the sexual assault label for something that he may not have done 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We don t need to listen we know he d listen to the experts and follow their advice  Yeah like when he voted against the Iraq War because he listened to the experts advice that there were no WMD 
PoliticalDiscussion,Um It doesn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the distinction you are making is pointless when the DNC currently abides by rules that make it democratic or at least pretends to  You username made me laugh thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Smh I remember when the latest moronic rose Twitter meme was that he was in front of a greenscreen Now people are out there complaining that he isn t in front of one
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure the level of enthusiasm from young voters is much of a worry they re voting turnout may be a bit lower this year but I imagine it won t do much to change any states results 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sounds awesome Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clinton wouldn t have disbanded Obama s pandemic response command for a start   And she wouldn t have spent time downplaying the virus  And she wouldn t have focused on the stock market during a public health crisis   And she actually had some healthcare policy to enact not just  Obamacare bad followed by  who could have known that healthcare could be so complicated nobody that s who    And she would have coordinated in cooperation with States Governor s rather than running against them   And she s about international cooperation rather than  America First nationalism when the pandemic is a global problem that needs a global response and some global leadership  She wouldn t have been waging a  fake news war against knowledge   Yeah it s speculation but speculation that s based on the reality of Clinton and Trump being two extremely different people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah I was wondering if Bernie has made concrete  this is how I d do handle it declarations yet It sounds like not which is perfectly OK Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not real elections It s the DNC a private institution picking which they are running for the real government election The DNC is a private organization and not associated with the government Bernie will not be the nominee no matter what happens and he doesn t deserve to be 
PoliticalDiscussion,She has huge credibility issue because she claimed she was retaliated against but Biden s old HR chief says that didn t happen and there is no evidence Not to mention your comment reeks of bias
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I know that s my biggest fear and also one of the main reasons I support a public option for people that don t or can t get insurance through their employer I m about to turn  too so I can t get back on the parents insurance anymore either 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand but his campaign has been struggling to make him noticed That shouldn t be the case if you re the Democratic nominee He wants to be president in less than  months he should be out there maximizing his abilities to be a contrast to Trump who he s facing in an election in  months 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s more because people are actually educated on this and know what they ll get from Biden  We don t need to listen we know he d listen to the experts and follow  their advice     We all know Trump is fucking this all up  There isn t even a reason to check under Biden s hood Trump s engine is on fire 
PoliticalDiscussion, not elections   rejected by voters  get your story straight
PoliticalDiscussion,How the fuck did this post make it past the Mods and my post asking if Obama helping out with Hurricane Sandy and Shaking hands with Chris Christie appearing presidential and bipartisan get removed for  low investment content   This story doesn t need any more oxygen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I m not saying he can do anything to change it I meant he should be politically capitalizing on a moment where the nation is in crisis and many do not trust the president  There s no response possible that wouldn t be casted as  hoping for Trump to fail  Right there with  socialism and  open borders  Nothing will stop that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Says a single woman singing a different tune last year
PoliticalDiscussion, alt left  at least as the phrase is used in American politics in recent years  albeit I don t see it used that often now  is used in reaction to the term  alt right  which is comparatively a bit better defined but still is broad vague and  mis used in such a way that isn t helpful     xB  So I guess there s a few ways to look at  alt left   Disruptive Violent groups like Antifa are branded alt left because of their behavior more than anything   Politically Left Simply being or being viewed as far to the left of usual American politics I m not sure where you draw the line on this as the dems seem to be shifting left anyway But certainly actual communists would fall into this   Alternative Anti Establishment Bernie like Trump pitches himself as a man against the big bad establishment who presents voters with an alternative direction While some of the other candidates also have fairly progressive policies Bernie points to their ties to the establishment or the wealthy elites as a stain on their record Warren was viewed as competing with Bernie for the progressive lane but he was more vocally anti establishment while she tried to be a unity candidate You could also lump the green party in this category and maybe the former as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Further evidence if you need it Detroit is not only GROWING but growing in young people Not only that it s outpacing peer cities   
PoliticalDiscussion,You are going to have to elaborate on what you are saying here 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not because the democratic and republican primaries are not elections   Either way Bernie has zero chance Even is Biden died  days before the convention he wouldn t be the nominee at this point He has been soundly rejected by the voters thus far And the remaining states are not favorable to him at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well you better pray to whatever god you believe in that you don t ever get laid off because it s a bloodbath out here 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But even then Bernie shouldn t assume the nomination it would be decided by convention  At this point there is a faction of his supporters who want him to win at all costs I just don t get it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why can t you implement a public system and then   gt put judges in Implement it Boom
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t change really anything He s all but guaranteed the nominee but right now news is focused on a global crisis right now instead of the election At this point he s beating Sanders as handily as one could hope and he s not out causing controversy so this adds or subtracts little to the current conversation  Once things get going again in late summer he ll be able to argue more on the affect of Trump s leadership since COVID and the economy will literally be the only thing voters care about 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And we saw how Medicaid expansion went last time around  Great in blue States terrible in red ones 
PoliticalDiscussion,What Why would you fight for anything less Its clear that healthcare in the states doesn t work and without a system that guarantees equal treatment and full coverage for everyone then it s not a good system 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are  amendments on the HR  bill     None of them belong to Bernie Sanders The idea of Sanders working with Menendez is awfully funny considering he had choice words for Sanders earlier this month  The only thing Sanders did was grandstand and vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed Looking at BOOKS is THE WORST Oh my eyes   lt s gt 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not a waste of time   When he s debating Trump in a few months time Biden will be able to refer back to that townhall   And actual people will listen to it and inform their actions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why is it necessary for the plan to be single payer to do that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s more liked  not damned if you do who gives a damn if you do  There s very little Biden can do right now that would boost his poll numbers besides looking presidential and avoiding any severe gaffes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty sure that s a big part of why we just gave the banks a trillion and a half fucking dollars of taxpayer money  If we do that and then don t do the thing that makes it actually necessary well that s supposedly what started the tea party movement  But on the other hand the President isn t black so maybe not this time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Put more judges on the court implement it Boom
PoliticalDiscussion,He s stopped raising money for his campaign started raising money for charities supporting the effort to support those effected by the disease   has been doing live videos with other progressive candidates doctors and specialists
PoliticalDiscussion,Something to consider though she just recently had her second child and her first is very young as well She might want to hold off on campaigning with that being the case  Shame though I d love to have her as our VP 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Seems like you wasted a lot of energy for nothing  Just like Bernie I m surprised you don t admire that about my post 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt nobody really cares either way what was said  That is the sad reflection of the incredible level of disarray in the American system Trump s  solutions are at best abysmal I just watched a Fox attempt at once more blaming China but they never recall the cry of hoax and the long period of inaction you have had Louisiana is now a hot spot after the failure to cancel events like the Mardi Gras I m a Bernie fan but Biden s steps will have more impact than the sh t show currently playing out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nowhere near close the odds  but you had to rub it in I m a falcons fan   
PoliticalDiscussion,Source 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie is a sitting Senator Biden is the party s presumptive nominee and like others before him he s been slowly rolling out his policy in speeches over the weeks He s not an elected official right now so it s understandable that Bernie would be  at least more publicly talking to experts and other legislators 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m aware they can do that but yeah that is pretty undemocratic There s a reason they started letting us vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Super Bowl LI   
PoliticalDiscussion,And Bernie has a history of getting nothing    Compromising for better healthcare is not a terrible thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay so the thing is prior to Trump mainly we had a federal mandate which penalized you if you didn t have insurance Some people still opted for just taking the penality despite the fact you could   gt Get tax credits   of Americans came off to me like a ball park figure based on the amount of Americans that re just belligerenty against health insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Now they think Covid is going to deliver Bernie the nomination  Only if Biden is hospitalized by it for an extended period of time and fails to fully recover   But even then Bernie shouldn t assume the nomination it would be decided by convention Without physical convening 
PoliticalDiscussion,This isn t an election It s a primary for a independent organizations candidate The DNC could decide it with a potato sack race on Sunday and it wouldn t be undemocratic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess it s not so easy negotiating with firms that are only offering minimum wage is what you re saying  In any case with practically every state that upholds the Hyde precedent your only real bet is going to a planned parenthood and planned parenthood doesn t get federal funding for abortions  With that in mind how would single payer circumvent judicial precedent What s the general game plan you have in mind 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s not a good or effective  leader if that word could even be applied to him He has severe issues expressing his thoughts without lying about his past or flat out trailing off somewhere else and with the current sexual assault issue coming to light he should be stepping down and hiding why would I listen to anything trump  says 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did you mean to type  untie  Because changing the untie to unite flips the meaning of your sentence and I suspect that s what you intended 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have to agree with you on that OP says that he can t think of a worse time for this to come up to the contrary I think this is the BEST time for this to come up  for Biden that is  Nobody s paying attention to it right now because of coronavirus and the way things are going it s unlikely that people will care about anything else for the foreseeable future It s entirely possible that these accusations will run their course without most voters paying much attention to it  As such if I were Biden I d rather have this investigated as soon as possible  the alleged assault occured so long ago I highly doubt that much incriminating evidence can be found at this point and then focus on the coronavirus when it s all said and done 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s really no point in it either We got a looong way till November No need to start burning people out on the general campaign now
PoliticalDiscussion,That account denying Russian interference in  was created in November  
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden s plan leaves  million people uninsured
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden is a rapist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden might not have dementia but you d have to be a fool to not see the distinct downward trend in his ability to speak and behave coherently over the past year or two 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There isn t really any proof at all  There was overwhelming proof that s been publicly available since  
PoliticalDiscussion,I said he s fighting at capital hill as a response to the critique that Bernie is nowhere   I did not say Bernie was able to make an amendment nor did I say he deserves credit for the bill or he should be above anyone   Seems like you wasted a lot of energy for nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion, Bernie was on the Senate floor yelling at idiotic republicans for their shitty takes on unemployment benefits    I wish he would have held it for longer until they split the corporate smash   grab from the people s help  they gave the already richest people in the world trillions of dollars and the people got a one time payment of   that won t even get into people s pockets for weeks or months  they basically did nothing to prevent this this is the biggest single moment transfer of wealth in HISTORY   there is now NO oversight on those funds NO tight strings attached NO NOTHING Trump and Mnuchin now have a blank check and a field day for their rich buddies  btw Mnuchin should be in jail but Kamala Harris office decided not to do that for reasons she won t talk about publicly that passes the smell test doesn t it  they rolled over yelled a little bit about how it was all greed filled bullshit but still voted it for because optics  we are absolutely fucked economically
PoliticalDiscussion,The election is still months away 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s already released his policies and plans that he would use to address this I m not sure what more he can reasonably do considering his only influence is on the elections at this point and hoping he would be listened to by elected officials If he actually held office that would be one thing but as an independent citizen he is pretty limited 
PoliticalDiscussion,What universally statement did I make 
PoliticalDiscussion,This thread is an amazing example of how people cull their media intake   Biden needs to maintain the bare minimum presence Trump s poll numbers are increasing but  head   to head match ups are still not good   If this is the peak of Trump s rally to the flag numbers that s not good   Biden just needs to make enough soundbites to look not like Trump and he ll be fine 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s up  points on Trump    This is really perfect for Biden politically it basically freezes everything in place and that s freezing Biden far ahead of Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that even if Sanders was nominated  and elected  it would still be a very gradual process starting now Both candidates want universal health care but both want to achieve it differently Whichever way it goes it will be a very long time before we catch up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I feel you I m not opposed to a better public option I just like my insurance and don t want to lose it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt his handling of the crisis has just been that ineffective and un noteworthy  I understand the disappointment in Biden with his response but realistically what can he do if he s in quarantine and does not hold elected office And how can he do it without seeming like he wants Trump to fail 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that s pure speculation Just no
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks it s really shame that it have so little views
PoliticalDiscussion,Well your employer likely pays some of it for you then Some people run independent businesses so we all pay full price 
PoliticalDiscussion,There definitely will but I wonder if there will be any change in perspective on the health care field Not necessarily with the costs but more with the attitudes towards the field as a whole 
PoliticalDiscussion,We also don t know how if Biden would have his goak implemented  Biden also has a history of compromising or outright agreeing with right wing politics so the number that he proposes on his own website is an optimistic outlook given zero pushback Which is laughable  I d like gradual progress too but I also think the time for gradual progress was the  s and now the US would really need a giant leap forward to simply catch up with the rest of the developed world 
PoliticalDiscussion,The primaries won t be cancelled There are local races But we no longer need to be focusing on a presidential primary right now It s a waste of resources that could be spent in the general and giving more air to Senate races 
PoliticalDiscussion,Although frankly it would be nice to have a nominee that is able to be address the issues at hand without his campaign worrying about him completely fucking up and blowing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like another commenter said Joe might lay low until he secures the D nomination It s his to lose right now so why go out on a limb on anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s over because Bernie would need over  of the remaining delegates to overtake Biden s lead   His campaign has done an awful job expanding reach They counted on a split field and it didn t work out They counted on Biden imploding and that failed  Now they think Covid is going to deliver Bernie the nomination  At some point his campaign would have to do something  change something to expand his reach We all know Bernie won t change 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has no path to win That s how it s over That s why Every other candidate including Tulsi  actually a shocker  dropped out and stopped wasting everyone s time and funds 
PoliticalDiscussion, negotiate out a higher pay since they re not on the firm s insurance plan  Haha that s funny and birth control   lgbt health   abortion as it turns out And it really seems like this entire thing boils down to all insurance except for single payer is bad because it allows this discrimination So again Biden still has a bad plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,He gave a good speech on the unemployment proposal in the relief bill which was  originally written by Michael Bennet  D CO     In fact Bernie  did not add a single amendment   nor did he  co sponsor the bill     There are many other politicians who deserve credit for passing this bill before Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed he is now I guess it also helps that Bernie has a younger supporter base as well I fit that demographic and I am on social media whenever I am not working lol
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup  All of the reports are that both Bernie and Biden are on lock down reasonably so  It is only Trump who is ignoring common sense safety precautions  But then again I also think that it is insane that Pence is ever in the same room as Trump right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the trump comparison makes sense It s apples and oranges  You re right we don t agree If Bernie was so great he wouldn t be getting blown out by Biden Progressives should have ran with Warren  I m a Pete supporter whose second choice was Warren Bernie was far from my first choice but I would vote for him if he was the nominee 
PoliticalDiscussion,EXACTLY    FIRST these Bernie cultists were asking where is Joe because he was absent for FOUR days even though he s not the president OR a part of the senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you don t listen to what he says then your opinion on him is ignorant
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t say it was completely ignored 
PoliticalDiscussion,To your last point they restrict it to members of the party 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like the situation would be the same under medicare for all This current problem does not have anything to do with the cost of care This is an equipment resource economic issue that the health care field is involved in This is not a direct issue of the health care field 
PoliticalDiscussion,oh look   biden doing what bernie did    two weeks ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dont think it will Sexual assault accusations are more about partisan fodder 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand that it s a short team loan  I also understand that it s technically a serious of overlapping  billion dollar loans to be paid back within  months over the next several months  What is the purpose of that if not to help banks handle a massive squeeze on their revenue streams 
PoliticalDiscussion,All campaigns that are anywhere near successful are driven primarily by emotion  It is a well established part of political science that voters do not base their decisions on policy  Obama had hope  Trump is cruelty and grievance  Biden is a restoration of decency  Bernie himself s campaign is driven by anger 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump s fundraising apparatus has nothing to do with these poll numbers   Biden isn t going to define himself during this crisis He s not in office and there isn t enough oxygen in the media universe to allow him to do much   The point I m making is that Trump isn t doing much to help himself and every day he doesn t get to attack Biden hurts him   Once campaign season hits his negative campaign and fundraising advantage could tip the scale in his favor but again that has nothing to do with the point I m making about right  now  
PoliticalDiscussion,That doesn t mean what you think it means 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most of the revenues of large companies are in the billions    billion dollar company the owner pockets a billion based on your math 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is probably just the cheerleader effect of so many garbage alt right far right journals getting big recently but Fox isn t that terrible for a conservative outlet Being mainstream ironically forces them to do more fact checking than garbage like Breitbart and Daily Wire 
PoliticalDiscussion,He should join his campaign with Sanders to initiate relief efforts 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If this is the peak of Trump s rally to the flag numbers that s not good  I think this is really shortsighted Republicans have been raising billions over the last year for the campaigning season and that hasn t started yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,The total population increases every day   If you haven t applied for a job in the last month you are classified as non working If you stopped looking for a job because there aren t any then you just a non working person This is common in West Virginia 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Meh he doesn t need to say a damned thing until he s confirmed as the nominee though It s his to lose and I don t think he s fool enough to chance throwing it away  His goal is to not talk all the way to November 
PoliticalDiscussion,From what I understand the  alt part of alt right comes from the fact that while they often sort of line up policy wise with the traditional right they are descended from a very different lineage of political philosophies  fascism and white nationalism        So looking at it from that perspective I think the closest analogues on the left would be the socialists anarchists Fundamentally they see in the world in a very different way than regular progressives even though they may have common ground on many policy positions I don t think democratic socialists would be included here because at their core they are still liberal capitalists You don t see Bernie or AOC suggesting the abolition of private property for example      As for whether or not  alt left is a useful term I d say no We can just call them what they are socialists or anarchists I think the reason we use  alt right instead of just calling them what they actually are aka fascists is because that term is so incredibly loaded that it s very difficult to use in good faith discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden said he would veto Medicare for All as president He s a terrible  leader for this type of issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that is Nate Cohn and others big idea that the obama trump voter was decisive But even if you swing it that way I m not sure that many of those obama trump voters are coming back for biden he is unapologetically pro NAFTA TPP special trading status of china etc That seems like it s borne out by the Nate Cohn s NYT upshot survey posted above if it s anywhere near correct Trump s coalition in the upper mid west is almost  intact it even had a decent section of people who voted democrat in the mid terms but still planned to vote Trump vs biden  etc    It s neck and neck so he needs to squeeze every vote of his potential base basically 
PoliticalDiscussion,My point I guess Also apparently maybe I m a bit sexist 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The only thing Bernie s camp did wrong was not being able to control the corporate establishment media  The same corporate media that repeated stories about Obama s birth certificate ad nauseum  What about months of wall to wall coverage on Hillary s emails    Here   is how the media treated Biden early in his campaign   Bernie ran a trash campaign It s already been documented and admitted to that his campaign sought  of the Democratic electorate and banked on a split field   That was their plan I m not even kidding  Time for progressives to find a competent leader I hope when the emotion is gone from the  primary Bernie followers realize how terrible of a campaign he ran   You re not going to win elections by screaming media DNC rigged elites  unless you re a Republican  
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because he made some empty platitudes from his mansion bunker  No I don t think so 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because he has no sincere policy positions to push  Instead he appeals to emotion  Maybe it will work   until Trump and the Republicans put all his scandals on blast   
PoliticalDiscussion,Simply false  It means he thinks a very limited version of  single payer is  faster to roll out than other options  Even Sanders says MA will take  years to roll out  In years COVID will not be an issue  We simply do not have time for an orderly transition between private insurance and government insurance now  Even if Sanders were president and had managed to pass MA on March rd   aka it took the same length of time to pass as the ACA  we would still need a quick and dirty fix to handle this pandemic  But that fix would likely not be sustainable for the simple reason that it isn t designed to be  Rather its designed to solve the immediate problem well  This argument would be like going  well in war you want a more efficient economy right  So that signals that a wartime economy is more efficient and we should all be building tanks and bombers instead of cars and houses  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  But that didn t get much coverage in the corporate media  Name one corporate media outfit and I bet I can find their coverage of his confrontation with that union worker 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s difficult to run against the candidates that have their campaigns funded by billionaires  which includes Warren  So many attack ads have been used against MFA Warren lied about Bernie being a sexist and implied that Bernie s campaign was funded by billionaires  The media is totally biased against Bernie as well Bernie has repeatedly answered the media s favorite question  how are you going to pay for it  The repeated  electability argument for Biden has also been ridiculous It s hard to see how the mentally declining touchy Joe that voted for the Patriot Act and the Iraq war is electable  Also Pete was a puppet for billionaires He also helped fund the phone apps for the Iowa caucus  which should be totally not allowed  I suppose Biden is similarly a puppet for billionaires since he also takes their bribes and helps them out  Warren totally supported that stimulus bill even though ZERO of her suggested changes were accepted She totally gave in and allowed the corporations to win trillions with no strings She sold out because she is a career opportunist that is trying to win the favor of the conservatives like Biden right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Several women last year came forward claiming that Biden touched them in ways they felt were inappropriate  But some people only care when Trump or a Republican does something like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea these aren t AIDs or Cancer patients that they can go meet these are viral patients who are mostly in the ICU and don t make for a great photo op Meeting with doctors and shit isn t good either when your candidate is in his late s and has a high chance of death It s a shitty situation but people attacking Biden for this are kinda out of touch with reality 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think the trump comparison makes sense It s apples and oranges  Not to mention that Trump doesn t have the power to do that so it s a moot point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anyone still pushing the dementia angle is pretty obviously acting in bad faith or didn t actually watch the last debate or the very town hall this post is about  I say this as someone who watched the disease in its early stages consuming my grandmother and was close friends with several people who worked on a dementia ward which led me to volunteer there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because he s not showing himself to be a competent leader when it matters most 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt having conversations with front line healthcare workers  The last time he was on video talking to workers he threatened to slap one of them  But that didn t get much coverage in the corporate media 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the point where a candidate usually gets a headstart on general election talking points   It would take something truly strange to pry the nomination from him at this point  He can safely ignore Bernie and focus on distinguishing himself from Trump at this point 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt His campaign has done an awful job expanding reach They counted on a split field and it didn t work out They counted on Biden imploding and that failed  The only thing Bernie s camp did wrong was not being able to control the corporate establishment media  They were comparing he and his supporters to Nazis and coronavirus  And that kind of thing was happening constantly  Meanwhile they ve completely ignored Biden s record and  all the people who have come forward with complaints about him groping them   
PoliticalDiscussion,No one is looking to Biden for leadership because it s obvious he s not a leader 
PoliticalDiscussion,Based on the Democratic s party reaction in Virginia I expect nothing will happen I mean you literally had the governor either wearing blackface or dressed as a member of the KKK and he weathered that just fine while the Lt Governor had two women accuse him had several Democrats call for his resignation and had staff quit  Both are still in office and seem to be facing little lasting repercussions from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why not  Bernie is publicly fighting for the American people while Biden is trying to keep up with his teleprompter at home every few days  Meanwhile  the Tara Reade story isn t going away even if Biden gets the nomination   
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a contributing factor but definitely not a big one the important change was older middle aged and seniors flipping Obama Trump this happened not only because Trump appealed to them with protectionism but because Hillary was absolutely hated in the rust belt something that Biden isn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think  for both Biden and Sanders they lack details  so I really can t say   I ll address this more when I m not on mobile 
PoliticalDiscussion,I actually found the windmill funding and airport bomb detecting equipment funding to be comical  I guess the idea is that since it is a big bill might as well throw in as much as you can I wish congress cared about us just as much as they care about windmills since both have to be legislated together while everyone else is wanting some beacon of hope 
PoliticalDiscussion,How does that work in practice Are there a lot of therapists who don t deal with  gay shit  How does this law fix that situation 
PoliticalDiscussion, Tara Reade doesn t seem like a Russian asset   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s dipped down again recently and I think the other comment was predicting that the rally around the leader effect won t last until November 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did anyone ask him about the sexual assault stuff 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure Joe wants a lot of attention at the moment 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I have provided a link which summarizes Biden s speech but the crux of his argument revolves around a few statements   gt  We are too late to prepare  His opinion is not only wrong but despicable When you factor by  person per capital we have a   fatality rate compared to other countries The only countries with a lower fatality rate is Germany the majority of the world has a far higher fatality rate to this China virus   gt  Health care costs for testing and critical care should be free  I disagree they should be exactly the same as other tests and critical care Which means they basically are free already with a small copay     gt  Rent should be frozen for the foreseeable future  he mentioned  months  Where is the evidence that people are boosting the rent Let s not spend time on what ifs and instead let s concentrate on what is actually happening    gt  Continued closure  specifically further than the Trump s anticipated start date    No Trump s current anticipated start date is what the expert s tell him it is I ll do like president Trump does and listen to the experts    gt Do you think this speech could spark motivation in congress to focus on passing legislation similar to these points Additionally what else would you specifically like for congress to pass to help deal with the pandemic since they just passed the   Trillion relief   I wish the democratic party would stop making speeches about how much they care for people while holding up the emergency stimulus bill for money for windmills and other nonessential services I wish Congress would pass laws removing the protected status for reddit and other media outlets that forge a false narrative and promote lies exaggerations I wish congressmen and women could be prosecuted for lying But more than anything I wish for November to hurry up and get here so we can get four more years of Trump and he can hopefully start putting laws in place to punish censorship fake news happening by reddit and other media outlets 
PoliticalDiscussion,No its not meant to divide  It s meant to prevent discrimination and prevention to access quality care to these services  In many communities  there is a fairly clear lack of quality care for individuals in certain groups and lots of discriminatory practices 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes and universal coverage requires universal coverage in red states 
PoliticalDiscussion,I e certainly not  universal  
PoliticalDiscussion,good elaboration
PoliticalDiscussion,Could make this argument for every candidate  I know plenty of Pete supporters who wanted to vote for him but couldn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,This allegation greatly affects his campaign in two major ways it takes away one of Biden s greatest weapons against Trump and it weakens the resolve of the most important part of his base  Biden has long been seen as a champion of women You don t have to agree with this idea personally but that s been his public reputation for decades The whole joke behind The Onion s  Diamond Joe persona   was that it was the polar opposite of his reputation in real life  like the ultra violent  Nuclear Gandhi   in the Civilization series  It s been hard to chip away at this image because while there have been photographs that have depicted him as  creepy  the women in them  came forward to defend him     From the Access Hollywood tape to the many sexual assault allegations against him Trump has been seen as a predator of women  so much so that the main protests against him were called the  Women s March    Biden as a champion of women could simply attack Trump as a predator But now Biden can t do that Any criticism Biden throws against Trump for his treatment of women Trump can simply counter by saying he s no better  Next Biden s image in relation to women is extremely important because suburban white women especially in Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania represented the swing vote from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump in  Some people dispute it but it s the most commonly accepted answer about how Trump won the election   it s often discussed in harsh terms   The white women who otherwise would have supported Clinton had a low turnout and the ones who supported Trump had a large turnout This makes them one of the most important demographics in the United States  if not the most important one   So far this has been Biden s greatest strength Biden s most loyal supporters have been elderly black people and suburban white women So if Biden could do at least as well as Hillary Clinton with most groups  a relatively low bar  then combined with his enthusiastic core support from suburban  especially Midwestern white women  think Leslie Knope  he would be able to handedly win the election  But now the most important group of voters Biden s most enthusiastic supporters are less likely to vote for him That greatly weakens his support going forward If people go with Biden s own feminist message and  believe all women  his career is over For people to still support him it would mean giving up on a core belief that all sexual assault allegations are true and starting to think that some of them are politically motivated lies Some people never supported the idea of  believe women in the first place but that s an important view for many people in Biden s core base  Ultimately this is the single biggest threat to Biden s campaign I genuinely can t think of anything that could possibly harm him as much as this will It has also come at the single worst time in his entire political career If it had come out a decade year or month ago it wouldn t have had the same impact as it does now The same goes if it came out next month or even next week But at this exact moment it s enormous 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay mate 
PoliticalDiscussion,yea the SCOTUS doesnt swing the right way
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely The Democratic Party is still continuing in the mentality that  this is the election demographics gives us the south  This isn t likely and I see this starting to become true in  more election cycles but for this decade the rust belt is the most important part of the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,And people should be rightly outraged by that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay because the individual mandate had its penalty reduced to  for this administration 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most of that seems like it s designed to divide people If you are going to cover counseling services cover counseling What does it matter if you are going to a therapist because you re gay or because you get pissed off at people for trivial reasons Mental health care and regular health care are things that can be utilized by anyone regardless of sexual orientation so why put them under the umbrella of lgbt health care The only thing on the list that is specific to that community is transitional health care 
PoliticalDiscussion,The same ways that every large  controversial has been protected theres very much ways you can do that And if the SCOTUS swings to support it then it would be almost impossible to remove it
PoliticalDiscussion,iirc lower turn out of young people in the mid west  but not the coastal cities is one of the things that swung those states to Trump if repeated I think similar things would might happen given how close the head to heads are between biden and trump If he doesn t make any kind of play for young people I think he s being complacent in risking this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cold blooded my dude Cold blooded 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Bernie probably doesn t care because he s already lost  You heard it here folks everyone left who hasn t gotten to vote yet in this primary doesn t deserve to participate 
PoliticalDiscussion, at all costs short of them actually having to drive to a polling poace and stand in line to vote for him like Biden s supporters do
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry it upsets you but you should complain to the moderators not to me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt we just gave the banks a trillion and a half fucking dollars of taxpayer money  This is now how the Federal Reserve works 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden is fine  Yeah it ll be just like Hillary in  except with dementia and credible sexual assault allegations  search Tara Reade   Hopefully the Dems will work on fixing their corrupt party after they lose again instead of blaming Russia or Facebook 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders has been doing Q A s for weeks now Biden s lies Voting record and now sexual assault Trump will have a field day
PoliticalDiscussion,Mental health care and counselling services Ensuring access to health care and non discrimination in this access transition related care etc   Which Biden openly supports according to Human Rights Campaign  see here  
PoliticalDiscussion,The party  is united  Biden s the nominee like it or not  I wish he wasn t   And at this point we can see that there s no point in making concessions to Bernie fans in an attempt to get them to go vote for Biden if they wouldn t bother to go vote for Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Many senators have already expressed regret about the way they treated Al Franken so I think they re already working towards that But I agree it s ridiculous they even let themselves get into this position Especially as  politicians  The payoff is so huge for a successful false sexual assault allegation against a politician it s stupid to not consider the possibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely although I feel he could ve kept a lot of those anti Hillary voters if he had toned down his social progressivism and focused on his economic issues Lots of these voters are in the rust belt and although they hated Clinton I think Bernie s protectionism and  bring back the jobs attitude resonated a bit with them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Condensed version Your vote doesn t matter 
PoliticalDiscussion,The journalists at the New York Times and Washington Post aren t stupid There s a reason why this story was picked up by The Intercept and not The Washington Post or The New York Times It was obviously vetted and had holes in it   I was surprised but Fox News was more fair than Vox Fox News went into detail about her pro Russia and Pro Vladimir Putin views Vox and the other outlets left that out 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m asking how do you ensure that Republican states comply with infrastructure and reimbursement for abortion and reproductive health services under a single payer even if we eliminate the Hyde amendment  Consider the arbiter for what is covered under public healthcare plans goes to the HHS secretary If there s a Republican president you don t even get to opt for private insurance considering there s a mandated single payer 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And a link to a story in this morning s Daily Mail   The Daily Mail is a problematic source for news that s only useful if you want some toxic partisan animosity 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Even his own website claims it would only cover  of America  As you said Biden s plan is basically the ACA as originally intended  aka with a public option and strong means tested subsidies   Part of that is the individual mandate  So those  are not people who cannot afford insurance they re people who are so suborn in their dislike of health insurance that they re willing to pay a fine to avoid having it  and jump through some other hoops besides that  They couldn t hold a full time job for example  You can quibble about whether or not that s truly universal but it definitely addresses the moral argument that everyone should be assured access to healthcare regardless of income which is pretty much the entire case for single payer 
PoliticalDiscussion,She is also on the side that called closing the border to China was racist when all this began so from square one I think you re still highly speculative here

PoliticalDiscussion,Yes we are
PoliticalDiscussion,He might honestly not want to push Trump into a corner though Winning is important but right now it s  more important that this crisis is handled well better than it is being handled If he goes around publicly calling Trump out then we all know Donny will dig his heels in and triple down on the  it s just a hoax angle and people will die as a result Like potentially lots of people 
PoliticalDiscussion,And frankly both are reasonable reforms That s what democracy is for reasonable debate    I feel the burn but a lot of people here are assholes in bad faith or stupidly think anyone besides Bernie are fascists 
PoliticalDiscussion,The timeframe shifts a few weeks earlier and Sanders gets locked in as the frontrunner while super Tuesday gets postponed 
PoliticalDiscussion,No she supported Bernie Ford s story was credible this other story is bullshit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine if Biden was shouting from the rooftops right now either criticizing Trump or making his own policy prescriptions Neither would be a good look He does not currently hold elected office Wait for Trump to shoot himself in the foot  more times between now and May The idea that  months is a short time right now is very distant from the reality as recent events would evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie spent more money than Biden pre super Tuesday   Sure there have been attack ads about MFA but polling shows an overall net positive view on it  In general it gets a bit more complex when you ask follow up questions but that s a separate debate   We really have no evidence of who lied in the Warren Bernie debacle but that seems to have hurt Warren more than anyone  I have no idea if Bernie is funded by billionaires  I highly doubt it but he does have at least one Super PAC I think this is a dumb attack because the only people who care about this stuff already support Bernie in the first place  The media IMHO isn t biased for Biden at least now for the critical time during the primary In the fall yes but that was based on polling That bias got Biden th in Iowa and th in NH IMHO the media could be a lot harder on Bernie than they have been B   Bernie said himself he can t predict how much the plans will cost     The electability argument isn t really that ridiculous either It ridiculous to progressives because they are progressive but a large swath of the country does not care about senate votes from decade s ago It s one of the reasons no one cares about the crime bill either What people care about is can you build a large reliable coalition that will show up at the ballot box to vote Both Biden and Bernie s coalitions are reliable but we have seen twice now that when it s crunch time Bernie s core group of voters don t turnout for him  There s no objective evidence that Biden is in mental decline and this type of attack is largely why Bernie lost Pete was not  a puppet for billionaires  His payment for his personal app had nothing to do with the app that failed in the Iowa Caucuses and that entire arguably debacle killed his campaign  As for your last point I don t think that makes much sense Warren and the rest of the democrats fought for key  provisions that they could get with the leverage they had which was not much The democrats have one branch of congress and don t have the white house You really think that holding the country hostage in arguably the biggest defining crisis in a century is a good idea   I know you won t agree with me and that s fine However I feel the need to point out to you that in the span of this conversation you have disparaged Bide Pete   Warren Yet Bernie voters wonder why people rally around Biden Well what do you expect Why should we join your team when your team says everyone else sucks Furthermore the idea that Warren is a  career opportunist for voting for the stimulus bill is ludicrous It would be political suicide to hold the country hostage right now  The idea that Bernie would hold the country hostage to get what he wants  I E MA is not a winning argument to democrats Trump tried it once and his approval tanked Dread it run from it but that reality arrives all the same 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Dude you can t believe everything you read on the democratic media    You re a joke   Have you been born in the Soviet Union you would have been a number  Communist 
PoliticalDiscussion,What impact would Biden giving tons of speeches  assuming he was capable have exactly Zero political events are happening right now unless you count Trump s bizarre press conferences The economy will tank and Trump will sink himself without Biden s help 
PoliticalDiscussion, lysdexics untie  
PoliticalDiscussion,Duly noted and the same to right back to you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I love democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let me guess you think the establishment is out to get Bernie  I had no idea Black people in South Carolina are the establishment  Maybe just maybe Bernie is a divisive candidate and democrats don t like it when other supposed democrats crap on everyone else all the time
PoliticalDiscussion,The trumpcare bill just passed Putting us in debt for decades and getting his businesses out of trouble 
PoliticalDiscussion,People get a head start on the general election in   March   The convention isn t for  months and the general is in  Get a grip 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the suggestion Can t take oxygen for granted these days In the spirit of reciprocity maybe you should consider making points without needing to resort to condescension That feeling of superiority doesn t equate to being right 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden haters are popping up  Give me a single reason to like him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Everybody knows that Biden is the Party s choice 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes yes I know you would have liked Bernie but it isn t going to happen I say that as a Canadian who doesn t much care who you nominate nor even really who you elect It s your business and not mine  gt   gt I would note though that this sniping is not going to change anything other than weakening his support from certain elements of his own party So unless your intention is to strengthen Trump it probably isn t a wise tactic Do as you will though of course I m just an observer here  We re still in a primary Pointing out the fact that Biden s campaign is hiding him for fears of reveling cognitive issues is to avoid a loss to Trump What don t you get I prefer to avoid a situation where Trump tears a bumbling Biden apart on a debate stage THAT is a problem that would lose the election for Democrats Not any  sniping back in March or April this year That s the point of a primary to discover these debilitating weaknesses now 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Minority   gt Woman  gt Disabled  The GOP  and sadly a good part of the American public would have a field day with her Veteran or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,How do you think did Tara Reade feel about Joe s  raw humanity  
PoliticalDiscussion,He s too old They re all too damn old 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow Not sure even how to respond 
PoliticalDiscussion,True We should therefore remind people who may have missed it that Joe Biden has been confirmed to be a rapist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah and people forget that the Russians play both sides I m sure they looove the idea of democrats accusing each other of being Russian assets 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re talking about Biden right  He had less than  people watch it live      most of which were probably staffers journalists and pundits  Bernie s least viewed candid video has more views than Biden s most viewed candid video 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you sexist Did you use  him because you can t fathom that a woman could possibly be a governor Or were you making an assumption based on historical or even current trends   I mean   Odds would put the pronoun at  him for a randomly selected us governor 
PoliticalDiscussion,So to understand you correctly  you are saying that only neocon can be raped 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean running a sexual predator with dementia worked pretty damn well for the Republicans in  so why not 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s almost as if there s a primary election still going on and people are still supporting their preferred candidates
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody cares for what Biden has to say right now The fact that he is trying capitalize politically on this pandemic is pathetic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Will it even hit rural areas that are solidly red They re already distancing The impact to them is that when it comes to productivity coastal cities blow them out if the water and it s not as if rural states are self sufficient 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well all of those suburban moms that could ve brought the election to Dems because they dislike Trump for his misogyny and vulgarity probably won t be doing considering Joe Biden is a rapist 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Shitty people can get sexually assaulted too  Sure This one didn t though 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is a Trump or Sanders supporter that is extremely upset about about Biden having the nomination pretty much locked up so she is using this to try to derail the nomination From her Twitter she seems like a Sanders supporter   She supported Warren    gt but she tweeted at Trump last year pushing him to investigate Biden for Burisma so maybe she also likes Trump  I don t like Trump and think the Biden family should be investigated And she said the same explicitly Did you not read that Vox article you lied about    gt The same thing happened to Kavanaugh where you had one very credible allegation and then the floodgates started opening with all sorts of fake accusations coming out against Kavanaugh  Believe Woman shouldn t mean  Believe woman if they tell you the earth is flat  So you re defending Biden and Kavanaugh 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if somebody praises Vladimir Putin it s physically impossible for them to get assaulted  Shitty people can get sexually assaulted too It doesn t make them not shitty but it also doesn t mean they weren t assaulted 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I ve done my best not to read into these stories about Ms Reade but tell me this isn t real   It is  real
PoliticalDiscussion,If there s one thing Bloomberg did it s prove that basically unlimited financing can t even buy you a primary Stayer tried something similar and ended up spending    per vote and received zero delegates 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump should be impeached but why shouldn t Hunter Biden be investigated 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah WHATEVER you ve been responding to EVERYBODY so we get it you re a Trump supporter By now please go away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did Ford write articles drooling praise over Vladimir Putin worshiping him as a global messiah and the pinnacle of masculinity 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What you are saying makes no sense A real sexual assault victim would leave politics out of it  So you don t believe Blasey Ford OR Roy Moore s accusers either They only brought their accusation years later once the perpetrator was up for higher office    gt and would not be tweeting to Donald Trump to investigate Burisma  Alright go ahead and prove this negative Why wouldn t a rape victim tweet whatever at Trump   gt and the Ukraine and hashtagging Biden s political opponent  If Biden raped her why wouldn t she want Bernie to win   If she loves Bernie so much that SHE WOULD LIE ABOUT AN ASSAULT why did she work for Warren 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t get your panties or boxers in a bunch   Take a deep breath 
PoliticalDiscussion,i am aware idk how you didn t gather that
PoliticalDiscussion,The criticism started waaay before he didn t have a realistic path to the nomination Bernie supporters didn t really attack Biden until the whole moderate wing coalesced behind him within  days to stop him 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The journalists at the New York Times and Washington Post aren t stupid There s a reason why this story was picked up by The Intercept and not The Washington Post or The New York Times It was obviously vetted and had holes in it  It was the Intercept that broke the Blasey Ford accusation Do you believe this is false as well Please explain yes or no   gt I was surprised but Fox News was more fair than Vox Fox News went into detail about her pro Russia and Pro Vladimir Putin views Vox and the other outlets left that out  So you do agree with them about Blasey Ford lying or not  Also you re straight up lying about the Vox article lmao They literally have paragraphs dedicated to that issue Why are you doing this 
PoliticalDiscussion,What can you dig up on the other women who have come forward talking about how they feel Biden was inappropriate 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt From her Twitter she seems like a Sanders supporter but she tweeted at Trump last year pushing him to investigate Biden for Burisma so maybe she also likes Trump  I know nothing about the validity of her claim but this also sounds like someone who just dislikes Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes yes I know you would have liked Bernie but it isn t going to happen I say that as a Canadian who doesn t much care who you nominate nor even really who you elect It s your business and not mine  I would note though that this sniping is not going to change anything other than weakening his support from certain elements of his own party So unless your intention is to strengthen Trump it probably isn t a wise tactic Do as you will though of course I m just an observer here 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it s a valid term in America but outside in perhaps Europe and more specifically Germany it makes more sense It s the left that isn t part of the establishment like the Greens and Social Democrats but rather anti establishment The Linkie party is Germany is perhaps the best example as it s anti establishment and most of it s voters are part of the same demographics that votes for the Far Right AFD 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the criticism is less that they are angry and more that they are angry at the wrong people  Bernie has statistically lost at this point and there are not realistic paths for him to take the nomination other than wishing for his opponents to die  That is just a fact  Attacking Biden or the Democratic party at this point helps no one accept Trump  People like Chapo acting like Biden is something other than the most progressive major party candidate ever are simply part of the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except that the main criticism of Bernie is now that he and his supporters are too angry or something along those lines I agree with you on this though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are there any other reporters she told at the time that re willing to corroborate that she in fact tried to get the word out Or is it more like   gt everyone in the media is in on it for the DNC and are actively suppressing those people from coming forward 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s worse than that  Tara Reade was paid by Putin to write propaganda for him took that all down then made up a story about Biden who s details all differ from her previous attack on Biden  in other words it s not possible that she s not lying     And this is the Russian propaganda hit job online that you re responding to 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve done my best not to read into these stories about Ms Reade but tell me this isn t real   I guess I now know why major outlets aren t picking up on this yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,It isn t a negative  Anger is a powerful force for mobilization  It just has proven in this case to not be strong enough to win a primary  Bernie s great bet was that he could motivate a bunch of new people to come out and vote and create a wave that would bring him victory  He did bring out a bunch of new people but Biden has proven to be much more effective at activating first time voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you are saying makes no sense A real sexual assault victim would leave politics out of it and would not be tweeting to Donald Trump to investigate Burisma and the Ukraine and hashtagging Biden s political opponent
PoliticalDiscussion,Are there super violent leftists Sure but not in the kind of meaningful numbers that makes alt left a meaningful label The alt right was a self designated label by andrew Breitbart Are sanders fans  alt left s Not really They just dont have an equivalence  Antifa is unorganized and small in number 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m curious as to why you think the economy will bounce back so quickly If this were strictly a US phenomenon maybe but this is locking down a good portion of the rest of the world I don t see an easy fix to any of this 
PoliticalDiscussion,It amazes me to see how effective moderates have been at taking Bernies passion and making it a negative People fighting to stop  annual preventable deaths from lack of insurance shouldn t be angry   
PoliticalDiscussion,Not only that They don t recall Trump claiming China had it under control and it was nothing to worry about 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her allegations in April  were vastly different from her allegations today In April her allegations were essentially the exact same as everyone else  touchy but not sexual She s the only woman so far to come forward saying Biden sexually assaulted her 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What about her hashtagging Bernie Sanders when going public with this Can you insult Christine Blasey Ford going public on SoundCloud and then hashtagging  FuckTrump  VoteBlue  Because he s the only one running against Biden Same reason JuanitaBroderick loves Fox    gt Victims of sexual assault don t usually get political  What Kavanaugh wasn t running against an opponent He had hearing of approval where she spoke and denounced his nomination Is she a liar for not speaking up in his previous decade on the federal bench Trying to not get him seated was absolutely  political   gt This is a Hail Mary by the Bernie or Bust movement to try to resurrect Sanders dead campaign  Why are liberals so gross 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not coming out  now  it s coming out again  Biden is a terrible candidate with a horrible record and the Tara Reade stuff is just the icing on the cake which will cause him to lose to Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nah not damned if you don t just don t care
PoliticalDiscussion,There arent enough tests Trust me I currently work in an ER and we send home people who arent showing shortness of breath or a fever  and even then we try and rule out other viral illnesses first to prevent using COVID tests if we dont need to so that we can save the tests for people will more concerning symptoms It is also a distribution thing in which it is unknown when we will get tests but that is a logistics concern rather than a for profit and uniform system difference   I get what your saying but now most private corporations are making medical equipment under the DPA Maybe that could have been signed earlier Possibly This still isnt a problem involving costs though even if the tests were abundant and free Lets say that we have  beds and  people come in with positive tests that require hospitalization  not every positive is hospitalized only if the symptoms are currently life threatening  That means  patients cant get a bed under the current system Now let s take the MA scenario in which everything is free and we have a few more people  who would be scared to come and pay for the tests under the old system who need to be hospitalized but the number of beds remains unchanged We are at the same issue  if not worsened since more people need hospitalization   I do understand your comments and I do agree that things could have started earlier but I think that this is a congress issue that EVERY congressman is responsible for MA might only offer a slight improvement under the current pandemic if any at all but not enough to argue that it would be a significant improvement with what is going on now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea he came in at the end after missing all of the actual dealmaking Speeches are what happens at the end of the legislative process not the start or middle Also this bill passed in the Senate   so even Bernie voted for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Capping it off with a mysogynistic dig Berners gonna Bern 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cmon man 
PoliticalDiscussion,It wasn t just children It was grown women he would do it to as well    gt Rubbing their noses  I don t remember him doing this I remember him shoving his nose into a  years olds neck tho 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with all of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Trump effect Politicians now feel  perhaps rightly that they can safely weather such scandals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Truthfully alt right was the gentle fied means of saying to Republicans from Hillary s  moderate posturing that there are people in the the Republican party who genuinely wish for the death of minorities and recognize Trump as a symbol of white identity   gt You have racists You have actual neo nazis in your party   gt ahhhhh that word means nothing anymore to us 
PoliticalDiscussion,  xB   gt Why did the first version fail   I already answered that   gt Why should he not have to go and cast his vote    No idea I think he should have been there to vote no    xB   gt Edit Nice   You edited your comment to remove your condescending  take time to research the matter please comment to try and make me look like a dick Well done I ll do the honest thing and leave mine up there  Don t get your panties in a bunch I edited it literally within  seconds of posting it and before your response was made Sorry that you got so riled up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ignore the source but the screenshots are real from Reade s old account    
PoliticalDiscussion,So treating her like Blasey Ford 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also Biden can use the  HN outbreak and Ebola outbreak to provide strong evidence that it s not just empty rhetoric from a campaign to provide contrast to Trump   Biden would be a better leader than we have now but he s not the one in a position to be able to step into the leadership void because right now he s just a candidate for President of country that is in the middle of a crisis and shutdown for an undetermined amount of time It s vital that governors are not overshadowed by a candidate for an election  months from now   Not only that if part of his campaign message is a more toned down less anger less of fighting everyone all the time and not being in the news or trying to lead via twitter This may be their longer game plan to contrast them Also it could backfire heavily to use this as a campaign message on an ongoing worldwide crisis that no one knows how it s going to evolve it wouldn t take much to overdo it and leave a bad taste in people s mind especially when he wants to be more of a unifier than divider   I m sure Trump would love to be able to shift focus to Biden and start fighting against him He doesn t know how to fight back when he s getting criticism deservedly so by people in better standing to make those criticisms   It s uncharted territory They re figuring it out on the fly I wonder if they re strategy is to allow things to run their course and then later on keep it as a campaign talking point they can be more pointed in their critiques because then he s not boxed into what he said earlier The anxiety and uncertainty will have subsided and people will listen more   I think the main reason he s not being more visible though is that it s just a bad look and looks slimy to campaign now 
PoliticalDiscussion,      
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh so mainly states that re republican have open primaries I guess it s to gauge likelihood of some voters flipping if at all  That s really weird though It feels like it d make more sense to leave it only to D and undeclared 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unlike The Intercept or a comedy podcast 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dr Ford told the same story for years to multiple therapists Reade has   well read this deep dive on her twitter feed   
PoliticalDiscussion,Now listen here The fact of the matter is this speech is a bunch of malarkey Now listen up jack This isn t going to change squat Look here people think joe is a joke That s the truth Ruth Back in the day we didn t have corona Back when I was marching with Dr King he told me He said the fact is nothings gonna change And he was right 
PoliticalDiscussion,AHAHAHAHAHA  
PoliticalDiscussion,Compromise is a fundamental aspect of democracy The all or nothing unilateral approach to politics that the fringes of both ends of the political spectrum want to employ is anti democratic and borderline or even outright authoritarian 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s funny this BULLSHIT comes out NOW and the guy was vetted and became VP for EIGHT years but NO Trump supporters along with the Bernie cult are actually working together to get Trump back in 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is he supposed to do exactly 
PoliticalDiscussion,No dude They literally said it would happen in  
PoliticalDiscussion,They do not in Alabama 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I feel like the situation would be the same under medicare for all This current problem does not have anything to do with the cost of care This is an equipment resource economic issue that the health care field is involved in This is not a direct issue of the health care field  Yes and No on MA alone However Bernie is very much in favor of govt plans and precautions for dealing with large scale issues such as this  But with regard to just MA the for profit system in our country has definitely exacerbated the issue Companies and shareholders want their profit now is no exception Also even if tests were in abundance the large cost to get one is a dangerous barrier that makes the problem much worse If we had a streamlined uniform public system we could purchase and distribute tests out to everyone rather than this chaotic and confusing situation In this for profit system with unnecessary higher costs the govt is less incentivized to plan ahead and purchase large amounts of supplies and equipment because it has offloaded their public health responsibility to private enterprises 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Trump shot someone on th Avenue  as he suggested he could and FOX News  covered it by saying at pm that he had an altercation with someone   would you say that they gave it much coverage    Well   it s no different when CNN or MSNBC give the Biden story a couple minutes don t mention his threat and then effectively blame the guy he threatened to slap  That s not much coverage and it s not reasonable coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion,But I have it under good authority that Bernie is the amendment king   
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the allegation ought to be fully investigated and if true Biden ought to resign  But the sad truth is that any male Democratic nominee this election cycle would have faced these kinds of allegations true or not In a post Roy Moore Franken Kavanaugh world    sexual assault allegations have become weaponized and it is all too easy for someone with a strong political motivation to sink a prominent politician s career by way of a false allegation    For the record I believe all three of these men are guilty 
PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t get much coverage or was covered by every outlet 
PoliticalDiscussion,I said why should I not I don t listen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really  I do
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And Tara Reade is still a Russian asset   I don t think being a nationalist makes you an asset of the government It just makes you dumb   gt and Bernie and Trump are still the preferred candidates of Russia  Lmao They have a disjointed political agenda in that case
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So you don t have any proof  No there s so much proof available that bothering to link to it for you is pointless    gt Because  billion set aside for emergencies during this crisis doesn t mean Trump s slush fund  What else would you call a fund for use at his complete discretion with zero public accountability   Is that what counts as fiscal conservatism now   If you have the income of the average American household Nancy Pelosi is the reason why you re getting  aid from the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,True  Biden kicks his ass in  States That Will Go To Trump Anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is for people who think  would and  should are the same words 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think many people would argue with Universal Health Care  The NHS was founded in   If people want universal health care why don t the Republicans have a plan to deliver it   gt I personally like Switzerland s model  This is what I am saying about cost      gt a system like MA which is an extreme  difference would require a good bit of sacrifices that might not be required to get this country into a universal system  I agree MA is not required for universal coverage  I infer your view on cost from the fact that you like the Swiss system  Is that a correct inference  I think USA needs a  degree change just to get good health outcomes  You can t have great health and massive levels of obesity 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not really true    Sanders won some battleground states Biden needs those votes in November 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt On the other hand maybe it s more politically savvy to ignore it  out of sight out of mind If they actually do the responsible thing and take it seriously it could give the impression that there s something there  This will work until precisely the second that Trump decides to tweet about it Honestly I m surprised he hasn t already Ignoring it is not a good idea from Biden s perspective 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Most of the revenues of large companies are in the billions   Revenues and profits are completely different revenue is everything that is made before operating cost that means everything before they pay the worker before they buy the machines before they pay the people to build the buildings Profit is what the business owners actually  take home   gt Technically a  billion dollar hedge fund can be a small business because they only have  employees  Technically it could but it s extremely rare Facebook is considered to be a company that has very low operating costs but they only pocket about   
PoliticalDiscussion,In most countries they don t start campaigning until  months before the election Human attention span is not that long  particularly Americans  Everyone watching Trump bungle and politicize the CV response is about the best media campaigning Biden could possibly ask for 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you have reading sources on these groups I ve heard of eco terrorists and the like and of folks who choose to live in communes with unique social dynamics but I ve never heard of these people being tied to white supremacy before 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mainly because of the photo where he appears to be groping the sleeping woman  I m well aware that he isn t actually groping her though   Now of course I don t think what he did was anywhere on the level of Moore or Kavanaugh but it was still wrong  I ll check out the New Yorker piece though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I get that it s politically convenient for you to make that claim but it s disingenuous     xB  Ford didn t entirely change her story of the events of her attempted rape     xB  If Ford had been going around telling everyone that Kavanaugh  ran his finger up her neck and made her uncomfortable only to suddenly change it to  he raped me a week before his confirmation hearing then we could say the two accusations are analogous     xB  BTW one of the Kavanaugh accusers admitted she lied about the whole thing  Not Blasey Ford     xB    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The total population increases every day   I know That s why you can decrease poverty rates and increase the number of people in poverty    gt If you haven t applied for a job in the last month you are classified as non working  I know but your assumption is that for some reason now less people are applying the jobs than before and I m asking why you think that percentage of people would change now What has changed to make people suddenly stop applying to jobs 
PoliticalDiscussion,The New York Times isn t owned by Murdoch Please don t ever associate his garbage news organizations with a respectable one like the Times 
PoliticalDiscussion,And Tara Reade is still a Russian asset and Bernie and Trump are still the preferred candidates of Russia 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden is a private citizen he doesn t make policy anymore This is ALL he can do Sure he can pull a publicity stunt and volunteer at a food bank distribution center but that s really dangerous 
PoliticalDiscussion,A record mind you that apparently eluded the Obama campaign that for months poured over Biden s history with a fine tooth comb  The fact that several other media outlets that looked into this couldn t produce it doesn t lend much confidence that it will surface 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think many people would argue with Universal Health Care I just think most people would argue how we get there  taxes insurance limitations etc   We do spend a crap ton on health care but I do think a system like MA which is an extreme  difference would require a good bit of sacrifices that might not be required to get this country into a universal system I personally like Switzerland s model but that would have to be adjusted a good bit to better fit America s diverse population 
PoliticalDiscussion, Black people wanted mass incarceration is easily the worst take I ve ever seen on this sub 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why do you think Franken is guilty I strongly suggest you read the New Yorkers investigative piece about him that came out several months ago  I feel pretty certain Franken didn t anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Rally around the flag Even Bush got a bump to  during   Honestly what s going on right now is much worse than   and Trump s approval ratings didn t even jump that much higher Trump will get some goodwill for now but once the body bags start rolling his goodwill will go away
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay do you want me to lyk when Blakey Ford s witnesses testify under oath as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,He basically did what Trump couldn t I admit it was a smart move Because he can say   We should lock down the entire country and every one in it and not have to worry about the repercussions   So when people are dying he can brag about it Because   he would have done it differently  But if he was president I doubt he would be advocating for this Because he knows the economic repercussions of this It puts Trump in a tough corner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay do you want me to lyk when Blakey Ford s witnesses testify under oath as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,The bottom line is that Biden s goal is explicitly not to cover everyone right from the start so it s entirely fair to question his commitment to  universal coverage I agree that compromise is necessary but I think you ve missed some key history of the last few decades if you think this kind of preemptive moderation represents an effective political approach   The things that make ACA style changes  easier are also exactly what make the system more inefficient and less effective at actually delivering healthcare to people They are exactly the weaknesses that doomed the ACA from the start and left opportunities for the GOP and Trump to capitalize on its shortcomings  The fact of the matter is that we have more than enough money sloshing around the industry to cover everyone right now There is little  no  benefit in terms of people actually receiving affordable care to continuing to appease the existing power brokers Medicare is the most efficient and effective insurer in the country BY FAR What is the affirmative argument for not using that as the template for providing coverage to the entire population The idea that we are somehow culturally incompatible with single payer healthcare strikes me as a very weak argument A big portion of the population is already on it and will fight to the death to maintain that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Blasey Ford didn t change her story This woman went out of her way to say it wasn t sexual a year ago and now it s full blown rape  Biden s campaign already had the perfect reaction  this woman deserves to be heard and her allegations should be investigated thoroughly because they are false 
PoliticalDiscussion, why would I listen literally what i said not that I don t  Reading isn t hard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey fair enough Do as you wish not that you need my permission in any case  Be well out there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mostly joking on my part
PoliticalDiscussion,No you didn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wake me up when the three witnesses testify under oath and the record of her complaint shows up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wake me up when the three witnesses testify under oath and the record of her complaint shows up 
PoliticalDiscussion,No he hasn t Flagged 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie is not a good candidate Period  We had a bunch of good candidates and they all dropped out Cuomo should just announce his candidacy He d probably get the nod 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What are democratic supporters even supposed to do They ve set themselves up to always believe women and criticize republicans about their members poor actions  e g Trump and his accusers   People had to know that  believe all women would end up backfiring right    xB  One of the women that accused Kavanaugh admitted she lied and made it all up  to get attention         xB  This is of course not Dr Ford who I believe made a credible accusation against the judge but if the standard is  Any allegation of sexual misconduct results in the accused being cancelled it s just not sustainable in any way     xB  People lie Pretending like someone doesn t have a giant incentive to fabricate allegations when it means the accused can have their political career derailed is silly     xB  Personally I think her story deserves some scrutiny but should be taken seriously The fact that she has changed her allegation over the past year and appears to have some mental health issues is troubling 
PoliticalDiscussion,That depends what you want  Universal health care as a human right matters to some people  Cost matters to some people  The USA spends much more on health than anyone else does 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah thanks for the clarification Although  million seems like a lot I think there are currently  million uninsured so I think getting down to  million is a good start to universal health care I do think that s a preliminary number though and we don t exactly know what demographic the hypothetical  represents either   I m unsure about how I feel about it but I am also unsure of how I feel about MA  not universal health care as a whole just MA specifically  I do wonder if it would be easier to implement ACA changes over time than it would be for MA I will admit that I do like the idea of universal health care that is not single payer based and I think that those kinds of universal systems would better fit us better than a single payer system in general 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for all the links 
PoliticalDiscussion,Precisely When millions are out of work the stock market is crashing and hundreds of Americans are dying Biden spending his time and effort waging a campaign fo criticize Trump will more than likely backfire on him 
PoliticalDiscussion,You got your order of events backwards   Biden was beating Bernie in the last primary states to vote before the virus really started spreading in a noticed way in the US He has since disappeared in the US news cycle partially due to quarantine not before  One of the biggest recent criticisms that has been directed at both the DNC and the Biden campaign was that they both encouraged people not to be concerned by the virus and go vote the day before some states issued stay at home orders 
PoliticalDiscussion,The USA now seems to have more cases than China and looks to overtake them in deaths in days  The USA had more time to react  What can you think about the effectiveness of the response   gt  the side that called closing the border to China was racist   Is this actually anything more than another one of the tens of thousands of Trump lies      There are some things that are not in the slightest bit speculative  The   communication  with allies about shutting the borders to them was incompetent  What justifies unambiguous incompetence  There is an issue whether to focus on a thing that is less important but clearly wrong or to focus on something more complex also wrong but more important  The right thing is to resist criticising the clearly wrong things Trump does like inflaming racism and destroying alliances  And to focus on the central failure to save lives and limit the spread of infection  Yes it s  speculative  but it is life and death 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Biden is rightfully concerned that if he attacks Trump too aggressively in person then Trump is going to turn it into a unity issue like how Romney attacking Obama over Benghazi the same night backfired on him    When your enemy is in the midst of making a mistake do not interrupt him  to butcher a Sun Tzu quote 
PoliticalDiscussion,The immediate issue doesn t have a lot to do with cost of care  except insomuch as it prevents people from accessing it which is a real factor  but the mid to long term impacts of this crisis will have a lot to do with it People who require substantial treatment for COVID will incur many thousands of dollars of costs which may or may not be covered by their insurers  or not covered if they are uninsured  
PoliticalDiscussion,Warren dropped out
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie had the biggest budget of the non billionaires running and ran the most ads And he was absolutely devastated by a guy who barely campaigned and had no cash Bernie lost because of Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was pretty damning by the time New Hampshire rolled around  If we say  of Warren voters were number  Bernie voters then he severely underperformed his  results  He   just doesn t have a lot of voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because were in the middle of a crisis Bush has a  approval rating right after   
PoliticalDiscussion, years ago  Please 
PoliticalDiscussion,As Americans we dont have a great concept of what  left actually means  Our current  left aka liberals or Democrats as some would choose as label are really very moderate some might say even closer to a  liberal right versus a real  left   So alt left for most Americans would be those actual dyed in the wool leftist   More specifically alt left would be a group of more radicalized  leftist who perceives solutions through zealous commitment to their beliefs and and method to publicize them  to build an organized movement 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What are you on dope This isn t like the Blasey Ford thing where she left an extensive trail of evidence demonstrating how this event had been impacting her for her entire life  Ford had documented conversations with her therapist with friends and family the changes to her home layout and there was evidence that Kavanaugh was lying about the party and the people involved  Lol remember when this all happened instantaneously You on dope You don t seem to have the firmest grasp of how time passes    gt With this it s just  Biden raped me in a DC alleyway and that s it Oh yeah I think she said something about  three witnesses and a record of her complaint    Oh so it wasn t it    gt I can t wait for the evidence to show up  Did you wait for the Blasey Ford evidence If you show me a post of yours calling her a liar in the first weeks of the accusation then I ll applaud your consistency 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty much my thought  She has changed her story  If this were really a situation she wanted to investigate Ronan Farrow and other journalists who handled the me too movement would have been more involved  There is a reason this is coming from the Bernie Brother camp and not mainstream media 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has been accused of rape by someone who worked in his office decades ago And who s story end up on the more questionable side in the metoo movement That s very very far from  conformed to be a rapist  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I have no idea why Black people in South Carolina would prefer Biden over Sanders but I d guess they re probably a little more conservative down there  What if I told you that Biden has a multi decade history of doing what the black community asked him to do Sure some of the policies they asked him to implement such as the crime bill backfired but they don t hold the against him because they asked him to pass it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden who 
PoliticalDiscussion,Given who is pushing it no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe it s the huffington post piece I m thinking of One of the articles I read completely left that stuff out   Huh weird that you would switch it to the more  lefty Vox run by Iraq War supporters Almost like YOU were the one trying to create a narrative    gt I did look up Wikipedia and it says they broke the Blasey Ford accusation although that got a ton of press and this hasn t   If NYT and the Post are you re arbiters of truth no wonder you get so much wrong    gt which tells me that the story probably has a lot of holes in it  If it did they would report on it   gt But Tara Reade claimed earlier on Twitter to have reported to at least three witnesses  NOT her brother what she  saw as part of Biden s staff  What   gt I m sure these witnesses and the record of her complaint will turn up any day now  You re ability to interpret information flipped on a dime huh 
PoliticalDiscussion,He is just going to play the safe game  Show how he would lead and contrast himself with Trump where needed  There isn t a point in trying to gain media attention in a crisis where he is going to be drowned out by faster moving events  He is just going to respond to events and capture them on camera to later contrast with Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh there s a lot of branches at this point though Mutualism is one that s pretty popular 
PoliticalDiscussion, Joe Biden s own website      gt He ll also build on the Affordable Care Act with a plan to insure more than an estimated  of Americans    of the American population is about  million people 
PoliticalDiscussion,True
PoliticalDiscussion,What are you on dope This isn t like the Blasey Ford thing where she left an extensive trail of evidence demonstrating how this event had been impacting her for her entire life  Ford had documented conversations with her therapist with friends and family the changes to her home layout and there was evidence that Kavanaugh was lying about the party and the people involved  With this it s just  Biden raped me in a DC alleyway and that s it Oh yeah I think she said something about  three witnesses and a record of her complaint  I can t wait for the evidence to show up 
PoliticalDiscussion,The media lead a ridiculous onslaught against Bernie They were all bank rolled by their political  action committees  They know boomers vote with their televisions They knew the younger generation would fail to come out so they manipulated a particular demographic to ensure his winning of the primary 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Next Biden s image in relation to women is extremely important because suburban white women especially in Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania represented the swing vote from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump in  Some people dispute it but it s the most commonly accepted answer about how Trump won the election  it s often discussed in harsh terms  The white women who otherwise would have supported Clinton had a low turnout and the ones who supported Trump had a large turnout This makes them one of the most important demographics in the United States  if not the most important one    gt So far this has been Biden s greatest strength Biden s most loyal supporters have been elderly black people and suburban white women So if Biden could do at least as well as Hillary Clinton with most groups  a relatively low bar  then combined with his enthusiastic core support from suburban  especially Midwestern white women  think Leslie Knope  he would be able to handedly win the election  This confuses me If those suburban white woman voted for a guy who was just caught on tape saying that he grabs women by the pussy and he doesn t even wait over someone who could ve been the first female president and was a victim of her husband s adultery then why would they care about the stuff Biden did At best they just don t care either way 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can look up Bernie s campaign funding sources Last I checked Bernie was only funded by a union based Super PAC and that was only   of the entire donations So acting like Bernie may or may not be funded by billionaires is pretty ridiculous on your end  There is evidence that Warren lied Bernie has been advocating for women presidents since   video evidence when it wasn t as popular Bernie suggested that Warren should run in  but she declined the offer It is totally against his beliefs and his character Regardless Warren has without a doubt lied during the primary debates about Bernie on other things so why should you trust her without evidence  The working class only get a single  check That is ridiculous and barely going to help the US Last I heard the working class would get about  billion while corporations get a no strings attached   trillion Meaning that corporations could fire their employees anyway and even do stock buy backs That s almost literally what happened in  and you think that s acceptable Pffft  Trumpcare would be completely worse for the working class than now That isn t even comparable to a universal healthcare system that is way cheaper than any privatized healthcare system could ever hope to be  Biden s electability is literally based on lies right now During the last debate he completely lied about his stance on past issues and pretended to be progressive because of the pandemic Biden s coalition is an effort to save the establishment control You re hopeless dude 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no alt left They are just commies and you can t go more extreme than commies because communism is already an apocalyptic Rapture seeking ideology 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except that the private insurance corporations will try to chip away at public option because a public option creates a ceiling for their greed The only way to make sure that UHC sticks is to eliminate the greed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well if you like rape if you like pedophilia then that is two reasons I don t like either of thossthings so I don t like Biden
PoliticalDiscussion,Or we re saying that a Russian agent is lying in order to help their preferred candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s his job to pull people towards him as a leader  Just like Trump did with his bitchy tweets during Obama s tenure  If he can t do that then he s going to be a whimper like Hillary was  
PoliticalDiscussion,So you don t have any proof Because  billion set aside for emergencies during this crisis doesn t mean Trump s slush fund  Don t be daft 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Here s a depressing thought nobody on the left wants to acknowledge Donald s approval rating is up  points      To be fair this thing has not even begun When CNN is rolling clips of overflowing mortuaries polls may shift
PoliticalDiscussion,It was part of the link headline but is now deleted
PoliticalDiscussion,If she had would you call her a liar 
PoliticalDiscussion,Candidates get a headstart as soon as they ve effectively won the nomination which Biden has  There s no reason to not pivot to the general For the record Biden was my nd to last choice of all the dem candidates but at this point Bernie would need unprecedented landslides in most of the remaining states to get the nom 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe it s the huffington post piece I m thinking of One of the articles I read completely left that stuff out I did look up Wikipedia and it says they broke the Blasey Ford accusation although that got a ton of press and this hasn t which tells me that the story probably has a lot of holes in it  But Tara Reade claimed earlier on Twitter to have reported to at least three witnesses  NOT her brother what she  saw as part of Biden s staff  I m sure these witnesses and the record of her complaint will turn up any day now 
PoliticalDiscussion,My thoughts exact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just releasing something for later use  Its clearly to contrast styles and will be used in the general election if needed to show how he would react vs Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Meanwhile Trump gets a prime time slot every day for free And he is campaigning right now and attacking people If the goal is  I can beat Trump  then shit now s the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,A seemingly rich old white fat dude who golfs every weekend looks good to a certain demo of this country
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No she supported Bernie   No She does now Before she dropped out she endorse Warren Did you even read the articles you lied about   gt Ford s story was credible this other story is bullshit  They re single witness accounts reported in the same source by the exact same journalist  The only difference is you like Biden notKavanaugh
PoliticalDiscussion,The people you re responding to are delusional They aren t interested in living in reality
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders s plan gives dogs health insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Biden raped her she d go to the authorities instead of tweeting Bernie hashtags Nobody but the far left and the far right are going to take this shit seriously  I don t even know why I m wasting my time arguing with you 
PoliticalDiscussion,A protected status What th 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders is doing his job  I m sure he will get a lot accomplished as he always has 
PoliticalDiscussion,It might not do Biden any good People are worried about their next paycheck and not dying not what Biden has to say at the moment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even more important is the fact that Biden will hire experts who are actually experts He won t hire people primarily for their willingness to thank him and stroke him 
PoliticalDiscussion,     gt No he called the Democratic response to Coronavirus a hoax       That makes even less sense  Anyone defending trump still now owns this pandemic      And they are no longer real Americans 
PoliticalDiscussion,If only a vast majority of the Democratic electorate wanted literally anyone but Sanders as the nominee 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sad what they are doing to joe  I don t agree with joe on anything But it s sad  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because neoliberals of Clinton s mold are doing so great over in Europe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Up until the late s Oregon was  territory 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure what you mean by establishment It s pretty obvious that Biden would toe the party line better than Sanders  I have no idea why Black people in South Carolina would prefer Biden over Sanders but I d guess they re probably a little more conservative down there Not into the whole socialism thing maybe I have no idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,He needs to be attacking Trump and ripping him to shreds Dems are taking it way too easy on him if this is a sign of what s to come this election I really don t see how we have a chance of defeating donald 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope  Not a Trump supporter  I just don t think it will do much good to replace Trump with a corporate warmonger with a horrible record    And this isn t officially a safe space for enlightened  centrism so you should probably stop telling people to go away

PoliticalDiscussion,His money bought him name recognition It can definitely get you on the field   but moderate Democrats were looking for  any viable candidate that looked like they could build a coalition to beat Bernie once Biden was down for the count early on   look at all the late deciders on Super Tuesday Everyone was looking for someone to coalesce behind and many people thought that Bloomberg might be that person But when Biden showed he wasn t a zombie campaign in SC Bloomberg supporters deserted en mass   he did much worse than even his poles on Super Tuesday 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden s job is to  lead  Let him project vision leadership initiative If he wants the job I want him more than  present  
PoliticalDiscussion,well duh because defeat donald trump

PoliticalDiscussion, gt MA goes beyond anything any other developed country has in their healthcare system its extremly generous and costly  Huh No Not at all What gives you that idea  The UK  and others own all the hospitals for example    gt And people like their insurances  Wtf Heeellll no they don t People like their doctors  MILLION people just lost their jobs AND THEIR HEALTHCARE INSURANCE because of this pandemic It s ridiculous to marry health insurance to employment   gt I know this because my country has a PO and its considered as UH Nation even with the  unisured In fact multiple first world nations have a PO or systems similar to it in their healthcare systems and these are considered UH A System with only  unisured would be an major step forward and a incredible feat and  Million unisured talking point only gets brought up because Biden made realistic estimate here  What country are you from  Also we have every capability to insure ALL Americans CHOOSING not to because you receive massive donations from the companies making large profits is a joke A public option has the issue of inevitably becoming bifurcated as a rich private system and a poor sick public system It s not better at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,trump supporters won t be watching CNN they will be watching Fox news
PoliticalDiscussion, Antifa isn t a group of people it s an organizing tactic Anarchists typically use it to inflict violence against property and on others in response to fascism It isn t a group of people it s like saying burning tires during a riot makes you a part of a group of tire burning terrorists   This is our tendency to take a  both sides narrative where it doesn t exist I have never ever seen a black bloc protestor tossing bricks through factory windows or punching Nazis but I have seen more than my fair share of confederate flags skinheads and Klan paraphrenalia in the real world   Anti fascist protestors are a boogeyman the media likes to depict as terrorists of the left just as bad as white supremacists and the  alt right  Nothing could be farther from the truth but it bolsters this idea that  both sides are extremists and we all just need to meet in the middle This is dangerous because it fails to accurately account for the demerits of each  side  one is calling for genocide and ethnic cleansing the other is for stopping fascism even with violent ends If we treat fascists and anti fascists as equals we re just helping the fascists   TL DR Antifa isn t a group of people it s an organizing tactic  bOtH sIdEs isn t real there aren t super violent leftists

PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure what you mean by  attacking and definitely doubt that anyone will ever prove this generalization to me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They don t care about American domestic policy    Ironic   gt Both Sanders and Trump will let them do whatever they want with the former Soviet republics  Trump hasn t indicated this and Bernie s record goes directly against it Being anti imperialist doesn t make you anti interventionist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t know of this quote It makes sense when I see all over facebook  I m sick of politics don t talk politics etc    People tend to stick with their main idea of someone and shut the rest out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders supporters have been attacking literally anyone who doesn t support him since  I don t know which rock you ve been hiding under 
PoliticalDiscussion,So why are they picking people with such different views even in that  policy Would Bernie have negotiated USMCA Moved the Israeli embassy Killed Solemani Or abandoned the Kurds 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean Bloomberg did show that you can get pretty damn close Imagine if he started months earlier He would have had a good shot 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the same mentality that translates Sanders rallies into  winning by a landslide  
PoliticalDiscussion,Right a political discussion That condemnation will cost him any chance in the fall It s not a personal attack on you It s not even a personal attack on Biden It s simply true 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think people are just confused about what to do I m not sure its hand waiving I think they are unsure of how to proceed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol  the  riggers  Ok pal
PoliticalDiscussion,But revolutions are  hard  surely if they get the next hashtag trending the establishment will realize the error of their ways and hand it to them on a silver platter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Liberals are doing everything they can to hand wave this whole thing away Caring about sexual assault and rape is purely performative for the vast majority of them and they only care about it when it can be used as a cudgel against their opponents You can guarantee that if this same accusation happened to Bernie Sanders or someone on the right they d be singing a different tune 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Lmao They have a disjointed political agenda in that case  Let me make something clear Russia only cares about  policy America abdicating its place as world police   Name  candidate who decries free trade and foreign intervention as much as Bernie does 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re not supposed to point that out  Or the fact that the only contests Sanders overperforms in are undemocratic caucuses  Just like  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok you asked for it  To start with Time shows his adminstration incompetence  A travel ban is only effective if it really is a travel ban     Or      Oh and how about his incompetent handling  From a libertarian focused news site      Shows how Trump is living to his legacy of fucking up  Only this time its costing people there lives     Here we show a detailed list showing how he keeps fucking up        Be careful to try and show Trump is doing a bangup job  I am responding to this as part of a political discussion  This isn t  politics where I am arguing how good or bad someone is doing  This is political discussion in strategy for politics  That is what this discussion is about  Not how many ways I can show Trump has gotten people killed because he is a natural fuckup which his dad even thought he was 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or Harris or Warren  But I don t see them complaining about supporters not getting to vote for them just Sanders 
PoliticalDiscussion,I strongly disagree  That would be impeachment by the public   Hopefully rare however an important option  Civilizations evolve  In the US hopefully one day just maybe  boundless greed and personal prejudices will become as socially unacceptable as slavery  If the Court continues to consider corporations people and sees no problem with the large amounts of money including dark money being  invested in elections   including by corporations that may not even be wholly owned by US citizens   that matters to our national security and safety     Although I believe in the right of choice for association in people s private lives and even private clubs organizations a business selling goods and or services to the public should not have the right to discriminate when it comes to peaceful law abiding paying customers following the same set of rules   Such as shirt and shoes required   I d also argue that telling bakers licensed by government to sell to the public they are not required to bake cakes to any paying customer and cannot discriminate based upon private actions of potential customers away from the bakery reverses the progress made when it was decided that restaurants could not discriminate against customers that sit at their lunch counter based upon color of skin They shouldn t be required to carry products they don t ordinarily carry but baking and icing a cake is different   Businesses selling goods and services to the public should not be entitled to discriminate based upon the personal prejudices of the business owner  Not having a way to remove judges appointed before society evolves and that cannot evolve will delay progress toward a more equal society with individual liberty and equal rights under law    and hopefully more equal opportunity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh Who cares he s too late to the game this is what other politicians have been asking for weeks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your vote does matter  Your problem is that so do the millions more voters who don t like your guy  Just like they didn t last time 
PoliticalDiscussion,They don t care about American domestic policy  Both Sanders and Trump will let them do whatever they want with the former Soviet republics 
PoliticalDiscussion,The projection is staggering 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Oh now there are MULTIPLE instances of assault  Yes Can you read the article you keep linking   gt Funny how this story keeps shifting   Are you stupid The article you link to call her a liar says this   gt Keep me updated on the latest chapter  Not all assault is rape Groping is assault 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Bernie is extremely moderate on this issue Just not in corporate America  MA goes beyond anything any other developed country has in their healthcare system its extremly generous and costly    gt Who said  good healthcare systems stop pandemics For profit systems exacerbate them  That is true and i should have mentioned that   gt Why is Biden or any self respecting politician dragging their feet on healthcare  A PO is more popular than single payer its also probaly easier to implement considering that you dont have to tear down literally all private insurances And people like their insurances    gt The public option does not  universal healthcare I dont know where you got that idea Biden s plan leaves about M uninsured   I know this because my country has a PO and its considered as UH Nation even with the  unisured In fact multiple first world nations have a PO or systems similar to it in their healthcare systems and these are considered UH A System with only  unisured would be an major step forward and a incredible feat and  Million unisured talking point only gets brought up because Biden made realistic estimate here 
PoliticalDiscussion,I work with DV SA as well but as a nurse I blame SVU for how distorted the general publics idea is of what happens when a victim survivor makes a report 
PoliticalDiscussion,The allegations may or may not be clear But she is clearly not recanting her earlier statements when making her most recent allegation You re feigning ignorance 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think most Republican want universal coverage that is directed provided by the federal government The hypothetical and ideal Republican model would be to increase job availability and have the employers provide the insurance   I guess you could infer that I haven t necessarily based my opinion based on the per capita costs because Switzerland also has a much higher cost of living     An identical Switzerland model would fail in the US mostly because private insurance there is not provided through employment You would have to buy your own private insurance here but the government would have to mandate a fixed price for the most basic plan that every American could afford Generally speaking the US would have to have a stricter Swiss system for it to be even remotely effective   The Germany healthcare model is nice too What I like about it is that there are multiple options I do believe that you should have the option to buy more premium plans if you want as long as everyone has the basic minimum health care coverage needed to survive Here is a systematic review article that I found that is a nice read    What I like about multi tiered is that many health admin and private sectors works would keep their jobs Would it be more expensive that a single payer Yeah it would Would it decrease costs and reduce the power of the private sector Absolutely which is the biggest complaint with the current system imo   The obesity conversation I feel is much different Although if more affordable health care motivates people to exercise and live healthier diets then I am all for it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You might learn a thing or two  Nice addition Maybe look up the difference between contradiction and clarification
PoliticalDiscussion,I work in law enforcement and I ve spoken to domestic violence and rape victims   I think analyzing their post victimization behavior is one of the more fruitless and stupid ways to figure out what happened I ve never seen a domestic violence victim who was attacked one time and agreed to prosecute The abuser needs to basically torture them for years or you need a third party witness 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt She s clearly saying something to the effect of  at this time Biden touched in a creepy way and at this other time he raped me   Yeah that s not  clear at all   She s talked about her time working for Biden MULTIPLE times Each time a different version of what happened   You trying to editorializing her allegations aside nothing about them are  clear and the fact that you are pretending there s no problem at all with telling  different versions of an event when making an accusation of sexual assault says  everything 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  links to a fucking medium post with screenshots of her talking about multiple instances of assault on multiple occasions and comparing herself to a lamp  Oh now there are MULTIPLE instances of assault  Funny how this story keeps shifting Keep me updated on the latest chapter 
PoliticalDiscussion,In  she was still operating on the advice of her family Biden is powerful man and you should forget about it The social landscape has since changed From what I understand she wanted to speak about this last year but people minimized the sexual harassment and she got scared off According to her she went to Times Up recently to get help coming forward and they turned her away   This is only suspicious if discount her responses for your concerns 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right and left wing more appropriately aligns with rural and urban distributions Your hypothesis that age could come into play would be something to investigate if average age steadily increased 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not just a coping mechanism Relationships are complicated Larry was a very generous and caring man to these gymnasts a majority of the time Their coaches were verbally and emotionally abusive to them Many of these gymnasts report Larry being one of the few adults that showed any concern or care for them He d sneak them snacks and get to their life stories Humans are not robots and cannot just completely turn off those positive feelings even when someone like Larry abuses the trust in one of the worst ways possible Combine that with the inherent shame sexual assault instills in people and you get a very messy complicated emotional rollercoaster that is never as black and white as Law   Order SVU likes to show the general public 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure and there s no way that ma makes it through the Senate  So if we re looking at realistic threats from entrenched interest groups make sure to factor that in too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t he get an amendment into the bill that gives the  million tipped gig workers in this country eligibility for unemployment payments Seems like that s kind of a big deal for some people
PoliticalDiscussion,Both Biden and Bernie have been  out there but the crisis itself and Trump s gross mismanagement and corruption  along with the efforts on the right to support him and try to defect responsibility  is just taking up all the oxygen in the room    Just in the last week and a half we ve had a new federal sick leave law passed and a  trillion stimulus bill while hundreds are dying a day in New York  and over a thousand a day in Italy   There s way too much actual stuff going on to hear what someone not in power thinks ought to be done 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it really does The foremost infectious disease doctor in the world has public claimed that the decision to ban travel from China saved the US time and lives Biden disagrees Biden is not the foremost anything in the world Bad look 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course but I m just saying what the first poster said about most rape survivors ignoring their rapists wasn t true in this scenario assuming the accusation was true 
PoliticalDiscussion,I cannot tell if you are being obtuse n purpose or not   She s clearly saying something to the effect of  at this time Biden touched in a creepy way and at this other time he raped me    I don t see where she said  no he didn t touch me creepily he actually raped me  
PoliticalDiscussion, links to a fucking medium post with screenshots of her talking about multiple instances of assault on multiple occasions and comparing herself to a lamp   O   k
PoliticalDiscussion,Doesn t change the situation  This is on Trumps watch  And events will show whether or not he has a good measure of the situation and handled it in a competent manner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Give us all a unicorn and make the Republican Senate pass MA right now  This is a totally realistic demand 
PoliticalDiscussion,Considering his very public and obvious signs of dementia are there any democrats on this page who think Biden can stand up to the riggers of a full campaign and potential presidency 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we need to prepare ourselves for the fact that the American public is about to be subjected to most disgusting and vile presidential campaign we have seen in the internet age We will see Dems accusing the president of essentially murdering massive amounts of people Trump will employ racism distraction bribery disinformation and anything else he can use to attack the Dems This accusation will be apart of that war I am not looking forward to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sexual assault survivors have complicated relationships and feelings with their abusers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t the  perfect time have been in  when there was a very real possibility of Biden being her vice president Or literally any point between the start of Biden s campaign  months ago and now The fact that she waited until Biden was the presumptive nominee is   suspicious to say the least 
PoliticalDiscussion,So he raped her and then she claimed  he just made me uncomfortable but didn t do anything sexual   She also changed her story about why she left the campaign One version is that she was fired because of creepy Biden the other is she left of her own accord    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Bernie is not a good candidate Period  gt   gt We had a bunch of good candidates and they all dropped out Cuomo should just announce his candidacy He d probably get the nod  Klobuchar who got next to no votes and has no support among independents or conservatives loses to Trump in polling is better than Bernie who checks all of those boxes Oh you re trolling got it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Many European health systems  include private providers and private insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,He said he would have not ordered the China travel ban and that Trump was xenophobic in doing so That condemnation will cost him the election That condemnation  featured in television spots over and over again in the fall  might turn this into a rout 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know enough about what s going on with the banks right now to know whether that makes sense or not I was under the impression Fed was loaning out the money to deal with liquidity problems that were already showing themselves But yea you might be right 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Cool Neither did Reade  Take a step outside the Bernie bubble sometime bro    xB    
PoliticalDiscussion,Key difference is that the Virginia scandal happened to people who were current office holders not candidates in an upcoming election Presumably if the Northam photo had came out during the campaign Ed Gillespie would have plastered the airwaves with it Would it have been enough for him to win Northam won  iirc so probably not It would have been closer though In this presidential cycle this is exactly the kind of thing that might encourage the Bernie people to stay home Maybe Democrats hate Trump so much they come out to vote for Biden regardless but it s hard to argue that it doesn t hurt him 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can guarantee you that neither Republicans or Democrats have raised billions over the past year 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt MA is not flawless proposal and Biden platform includes the public option which is a form of UH  gt   gt Also good Healthcare systems dont stop a Pandemic awareness and lockdowns do  The public option does not  universal healthcare I dont know where you got that idea Biden s plan leaves about M uninsured  Who said  good healthcare systems stop pandemics For profit systems exacerbate them  Why is Biden or any self respecting politician dragging their feet on healthcare  The  debate has been settled around the world  especially after covid  Bernie is extremely moderate on this issue Just not in corporate America  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we re in the middle of a strong shift to the left  Demigraphics yes are catching up with republicans but they seem to be quite creative in suppressing the vote  It won t be enough though  We re at the beginning of a second depression  That will be enough    to shift the country hard left  After  years of the era of big government being over the era off big business is over The economics of this virus are enough I think for the shift  Economics aside I often wonder how many republican voters will fall ill and die because they were too stupid to stay the fuck home  I can t believe the number of idiots who tell me its a hoax by the lib ruls  Ya can t fix stupid 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump leads Biden in Pennsylvania Trump leads Biden in Ohio Trump and Biden tied in Wisconsin Biden leads Trump in Michigan  A couple months ago Biden lead all four states Public perception is changing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also does that make Warren a  candidate of Russia 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her explanation is that she told different experiences with Biden Not the same episode with different facts 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I get that it s politically convenient for you to make that claim but it s disingenuous  What a funny way to start this disgusting post Right back at cha   gt Ford didn t entirely change her story of the events of her attempted rape  Cool Neither did Reade   gt If Ford had been going around telling everyone that Kavanaugh  ran his finger up her neck and made her uncomfortable only to suddenly change it to  he raped me a week before his confirmation hearing then we could say the two accusations are analogous   her allegations then were that she was  objectified inappropriately touched by Biden and later retaliated against after complaining     That article alleges that Reade claimed then that Biden  touched her several times making her feel uncomfortable    Wheres the lie Where s the discontinuity It s not like you knew the entirety of the Kavanaugh case before the testimony either  Were you calling Blasey Ford a liar before she spoke as well   gt BTW one of the Kavanaugh accusers admitted she lied about the whole thing  Not Blasey Ford    I really don t get it Is your point every woman who isn t Blasey Ford is lying and therefore deserves to be treated as right wing media treated her Because if it isn t then what the fuck are you talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Metoo has taught has anything its that this is not uncommon Gabby Douglas attacking other American gymnasts for prosecuting Larry Nasser A week later Douglas stated she was also a victim of Nasser   This is probably some kind of coping mechanism Some way
PoliticalDiscussion,Die Linke are far left but not necessaily anti etablishment They are the biggest party in Thuringia and have been included in quite a few State Goverments The rethoric is obviously aimed against  elites and inequality but the party itself has been part of the political machinery for a long time  And while dissatified voters tend to go for the AFD or Die Linke as a protest vote sometimes the partys are very different and die Linke is obviously magnitudes less toxic than the AFD 
PoliticalDiscussion,Being inappropriate isnt rape 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt She is also on the side that called closing the border to China was racist  We were talking about her not a  side    Did she call that piece of racism from Trump racist   Trump closed the borders to places that he had ideological beef with and that he had seen US relationships with deteriorate already   Remind me again how effective that was at preventing a pandemic in the US    gt I think you re still highly speculative here  You know I m right though   Clinton s a grown adult who can listen to experts while Trump s some angry man baby that has consistently downplayed the disease that has already infected  Americans and killed    He s an absolute failure when it comes to Covid  and I ve clearly outlined why Clinton was much better prepared to handle something like this and all you can come back with is some triggered nonsense where you re upset about a racist being called a racist   What happened to  telling it like it is  Or did that only mean  tell me what I want to hear  
PoliticalDiscussion,If you Joe Biden di what Reade accused him of this is the perfect time It is now a real possibility that in her mind her rapist is going to be her president That s a disturbing prospect for anyone in that situation If she wants some sort of acknowledgement by Biden or the public now is as good a time as any other because people are paying attention 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The idea of Sanders working with Menendez is awfully funny considering he had choice words for Sanders earlier this month  TBF Ted Cruz and AOC have worked together on a bill despite both being ideologues that bicker publicly with each on Twitter Plenty of coworkers that hate each other still work with each other 
PoliticalDiscussion,Countries around the world have shown that you can infuse a private sector into universal health care The problem with the US s private sector is that it has a majority of the bargaining power whereas it is more controlled and regulated in other countries  i e Switzerland  The ACA can be successful but it needs a lot of work MA would need a lot of work as well Some people favor MA which is fine and others favor ACA which is also fine I also think it is fair to question Biden s commitement but we need to get a foundation of insuring people Maybe we start with an improved ACA that gets many more American insured and then we adjust that further even if it goes into a single payer system in the future   Going to single payer is the easy but extreme way imo especially with the current system and you also have to consider that it has to be passed through congress which makes the situation even muddier for trying to get a single payer system in Also there are so many other underlying problems that have to be addressed first What about the physician shortage  MA would potentially worsen it  What about all the jobs for people that work in the medical billing industry in the private sector What about the jobs with health administration workers in which they will probably be hit worse than healthcare providers What exactly will happen to current health care workers in terms of reimbursement pay It is easy to say that  people should work in the health care industry because they love it  but few people will be interested in going into the field if for example salaries are heavily reduced  I know this is a media based issue but it might factor into the equation with the public s reception of the ideas placed forth  I m a medical student I do enjoy the idea of universal health care because I have seen people who are unable to pay and it does hit hard It shows that we need a change   I do agree that Medicare is efficient with reimbursements  definitely compared to private insurances  but I would like to see a higher Reimbursement rates regardless of the system As I said both systems would be fine but I don t think the answer is  Single payer is the only way  
PoliticalDiscussion,Noone cares what Biden has to say period 
PoliticalDiscussion,She has told multiple shifting versions of this story from  he touched me and made me uncomfortable but it wasn t sexual to  he sexually harassed me to now  he raped me    xB  Given how pro Bernie and anti Biden she appears to be  talking about the  establishment stealing the nom from Bernie as well as the rest of her incredibly odd behavior It s not hard to imagine this being a false account     xB         xB  And before you compare this to Prof Ford s allegations Ford never told multiple versions of the same story 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sanders won some battleground states  Which ones Biden won Florida North Carolina Arizona and Michigain
PoliticalDiscussion,You mean states such as Washington Maine Minnesota and Illinois 
PoliticalDiscussion,and then he won reelection
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t matter what other countries do  If you want to win a US election you campaign as early you think someone will pay attention   Recent polling suggests the public generally approves of Trump s handling of Covid btw 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uh there is literally oversight for the spending in the bill That s why it failed the first time it was negotiated in afterwards 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is none of these groups mentioned really capture the radical nature of the  alt right  but for leftists  The principle use of  alt right includes literal Nazi and white supremacy groups who self branded and who exist in significant numbers  There s not really an analogy of this on the left Card carrying communists demanding revolution are basically extinct Maybe eco terrorists They re around but from my understanding they re minuscule groups with little presence these days 
PoliticalDiscussion,If democrats win the presidency by winning back Wisconsin then a single senate seat is a worthwhile price 
PoliticalDiscussion,MA is not flawless proposal and Biden platform includes the public option which is a form of UH  Also good Healthcare systems dont stop a Pandemic awareness and lockdowns do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course   It worked last time why wouldn t they help Trump and help sew chaos again this time around 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll admit it s a little difficult since this   gt  you ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she s talking about is real  is to describe it charitably putting a lot of qualifiers on the statement Still he does still say that we should presume that at least the essence of the allegation is real which is   not significantly better for him imo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody is saying cancel the primaries There s plenty of local races in the primaries too  What people are saying is that Bernie is done and they re not obligated to pretend otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,It just means no one cares about either Biden or Sanders right now   This is a Trump show Democratic chances hinge completely on how badly Trump botches the emergency Nothing Sanders or Biden doing anything will ever have any effect on the general election because the Pandemic is sucking all oxygen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kavanaugh was a federal judge He didn t just become the scotus nominee out of nowhere 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sun Tzu didn t have Trump an the enemy Trump seems incapable of actually conceptualizing things like this He s prone to shooting himself in the foot then amputating his foot off with a chiansaw for some reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,Got a source on that The endorsement 
PoliticalDiscussion,If he lost on a  approval rating id be asking questions about the approval rating poll or the election cuz that s a big thud 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhhh because Russia is our enemy and they attacked us in  and are planning to attack us again in  Very strange to me that somebody that s a huge supporter of Vladimir Putin would want to damage the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party when he s getting ready to face Donald Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion, approval is a lot 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody on the left would brand alt because they dont want to compared to people they call and compare to Nazis  right or wrong I won t touch on that  They d use different terms that align more with their values The altright picked the label altright for specific reasons good or bad  again not touching that and so too would any other group  Id wager there are labels such as that on the left figuring them out is a bit trickier since they dont have quite the same connection to major political figures as the altright seem to but there no doubt they exist somewhere assuming you can define any of this because definining anything in politics is like wack a mole you think you got the term then it moves 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes he raped her and she didn t want to accuse him out of fear of repercussions That is why so many powerful men have gotten away with these things for so long  That is what this whole  metoo conversation has been about  By all means be thorough but it sounds like you re being straight up dismissive 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol Dems really running with Russia 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally you ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she s talking about is real  This is not a contradiction to what I said and if memory serves it s basically what the Biden campaign said about Reade 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a fair opinion but with respect to my original comment it just seems a bit tone deaf to ask for donations right now when an unprecedented amount of people are losing their jobs struggling to pay bills and on top of all that fearing a life threatening pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why does it matter that she likes Putin 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re not fooling anyone with your lies of  thank Nancy Pelosi for money the bi partisan bill was filibustered because of this snake and giving people a pay raise during this crises and I to six months after just encourages people to be slow getting back to work Which helps no one   So in the end you are just daft 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is nothing so stupid as tying health insurance to employers  In theory the idea is that this will encourage others to get jobs and thus boost the economy But this is always limited if jobs are not readily available    gt I can t imagine anyone suggesting that  So why are you implying that MA would improve this   gt What health care should poor people miss out on    gt    gt Looking around the globe every step in that direction seems to make health care worse    xB  So poor people would not miss out on any service They would still be able to access and receive affordable  or free care However hypothetically paying more would potentially enable you to for example skip wait times for procedures Single payer systems are notorious for extremely long wait times  and the physician shortage in the US would exacerbate that problem    Or different plans would offer different benefits for different chronic conditions  maybe one plan provides better coverage for cancer treatment whereas another plan would provide better coverage for cardiovascular treatments  This just provides flexibility in a universal system Single payer systems and Multipayer systems both have their share of pros and cons Both can offer universal coverage at a much cheaper rate than what we are paying now  Also  and if I am being honest  if I am paying more in taxes without consent than other Americans I feel that I would at least like an option to pick a plan that suits me   As I mentioned above you should read this article I does a great job outlining the comparable differences between both systems    
PoliticalDiscussion,That is a trash article that keeps trying to use her like of Russia as something against her  Also you can say Biden touched you inappropriately and later say he also sexually assaulted you without  changing the story  Why is everyone assuming she is talking about one specific incident in her first complaint 
PoliticalDiscussion,He just became minority leader and the  map is very favorable for the dems so I assume he ll want to stick around and be the majority leader for a while too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Vox and the Intercept aren t even covering her story they re covering incidental aspects of it The Intercept declining to actually cover her story and only report on it indirectly doesn t bode well for her claims being taken seriously 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Let me guess you think the establishment is out to get Bernie  The whole of DNC big media absolutely do not want him to win If you don t see that you re the crazy one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol if Americans can t handle criticism of the government in a time when it is failing they deserve Trump and the mess we re in now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is it a foregone conclusion that Schumer runs again He s up in  I doubt AOC would primary him but she might run for it if he retires 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely preferable to make a bunch of empty promises he has no intent of backing up and then spend four years capitulating to right wing desires Can t wait for a Biden presidency The man showed his true colors when he swing a race by endorsing a republican in 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kavanaugh had accusations surface when he became a figure of national prominence Biden has been a figure of national prominence for at least  years and arguably longer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ditto for The Intercept 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about this case makes you think she is lying 
PoliticalDiscussion,The fact that anyone takes what Biden says seriously after he lied repeatedly in the past debate is insane to me
PoliticalDiscussion,I d agree that it probably wasn t the best catchphrase 
PoliticalDiscussion,Any criticism of valid faults in policy or personal conduct is considered an attack if it comes from a Bernie supporter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly Who gives a shit what he has to say He s senile and immoral Let s put the person with a heart and a plan on the air 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to Joe Biden it means there should be a presumption that a woman who alleges sexual assault is telling the truth      This would logically mean that the burden of proof is on the one being accused of sexual assault That is what we were told by numerous senate Democrats during the Kavanaugh hearings It would seem then that Biden either has to renounce that standard or produce some evidence of his innocence Until then we should according to Joe Biden presume that Joe Biden is guilty That s why I think this is such an awful standard but even if he didn t do it you can t say the man didn t bring it upon himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,What parts of her story actually changed though She said Biden was routinely inappropriate and not respecting personal space a while ago along with other people who used to work for Biden Now she s talking about a specific incident where she was assaulted Both of those things can be true she s not changing one specific story 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are blatantly moving goalposts on this 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean he can spend his money on losing the rest of the primary all he wants Joe has to save up for the general though
PoliticalDiscussion,Hunter Biden is NOT being investigated by any agency of the US or Ukrainian governments They did them already and found nothing wrong  In terms of his qualifications Hunter Biden graduated from Yale Law school served in the US department of commerce served on the board of Amtrak became a lobbyist until his father first ran for the Presidency  resigning from that because of the appearance of a conflict of interest would be had his father won  and founded BHR partners  a highly successful venture capital firm helping mostly Chinese clients select overseas investments  mostly US and deal with regulatory hurdles He has extensive executive and legal experience in international law  All of this is exactly the kind of thing that many CEOs look for when seeking to fill out their board positions 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe the Sanders campaign has recently indicated that they plan to continue campaigning in the Democratic primary so I would imagine money donated towards his campaign would be used for that   Source  
PoliticalDiscussion,When a group swings it s vote it s not generally a single person choosing to vote for one politician or another   though that happens often too   It s usually supporters losing enthusiasm and choosing not to vote at all and opponents gaining enthusiasm and choosing to vote more Turnout matters more than swinging an individual vote  One of Trump s weaknesses was that he was perceived as a corrupt businessman who was trying to exchange political favors for business deals Clinton did not have that reputation in  when she ran against Obama in the Democratic primary So Trump repeatedly said that Hillary Clinton was corrupt and that she was taking bribes in exchange for political favors when she was in office That s why the email server was such a big deal The idea was that her outside email server had records of all the bribes she was taking and it was not on government servers where it could be monitored   In this way Trump was successfully able to disarm one of Hillary Clinton s attacks and reduce concerns about himself  if you think I m corrupt she s just as corrupt  Clinton supporters continued to vote for her but suburban white women who usually vote blue had a low turnout Meanwhile suburban white women who lean red had a big turnout You win by getting your supporters to turn up and vote and by getting your opponent s supporters to stay home 
PoliticalDiscussion,u amputatorbot
PoliticalDiscussion,AOC is not very popular in New York she s not going to be able to successfully primary anyone there 
PoliticalDiscussion,The issue isn t that liking Putin makes you shitty and we shouldn t believe shitty people it s that someone who s expressing a preference for Putin has a motive to discredit the candidate that s disfavored by Russia  Biden  And someone who has a motive to lie is more likely to lie  The appropriate analogy would be if Blasey Ford had written several op eds prior to her allegations discussing how crucial abortion rights are and how we need to use any means necessary to ensure that  Roe is never overturned That certainly wouldn t be dispositive but it would make it relatively less likely that she was telling the truth 
PoliticalDiscussion,Makes sense Biden has to actually run in the general What else is Bernie gonna be spending the money on 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are an ignorant loon You have no idea what you are talking about    Sticking with my religious values   yes do And keep that shit to yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see this happening Both campaigns seem to be approaching this differently  Sanders asked his followers to donate towards coronavirus relief efforts instead of his campaign and raised  million    Joe Biden just yesterday asked his followers to  chip in a few dollars for his campaign   
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not true She said she told her family and her family said to forget about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what it should mean But you are oh so wrong if you think that s what a lot of liberal people think Especially in my circle of peers And it s not just some fringe group of people the majority of people I work with would NOT say that that s what  believe all women means 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her family She s said there s a public record of it and multiple people she told right after the incident Looking forward to seeing the record and the witnesses 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the right thing to do is just ignore the story and let It die The story doesn t pass the smell test and the accuser doesn t have a lot of credibility so the story should be buried 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think most Republican want universal coverage that is directed provided by the federal government   It strikes me that Republicans and Democrats in the USA have revealed they have other priorities rather than universal health care  Democrats until maybe the Clinton Administration  And Republicans still   gt The hypothetical and ideal Republican model would be to increase job availability  I don t see any realistic plan to deliver that   gt  and have the employers provide the insurance  There is nothing so stupid as tying health insurance to employers  I don t know why anyone thinks that makes sense  Maybe step  is to acknowledge that you have a problem   gt  Although if more affordable health care motivates people to exercise and live healthier diets then I am all for it  I can t imagine anyone suggesting that  It is more like a government is facing a health care bill  They work out that if they get people eating health food getting them out of cars and onto public transport and bicycles that bill will go down  So they invest in bike paths and public transport  Private health insurance companies are not going to build bike paths  Private health insurance can t regulate food or marketing to reduce unhealthy food  Governments can justify the cost in savings in health care they would otherwise pay for   gt I do believe that you should have the option to buy more premium plans   What health care should poor people miss out on  Looking around the globe every step in that direction seems to make health care worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m confused  Ford accused Kavanaugh of criminal acts in the early s and you weren t supposed to ask any questions about that  Shouldn t we just  BelieveWomen and accept that what she s saying is true regardless of how long ago it was or any other circumstances 
PoliticalDiscussion,She wrote some bizarre stuff praising Vladimir Putin so it would not surprise me if she s trying to get Trump re elected but she was a Tulsi and Bernie fan so I think it s just as likely that she realized that Bernie s campaign is running on fumes and this is an effort to save him  This story is actually being pushed by the left and not the right This is their Hail Mary to take Biden out and they are  PISSED that it s not being covered by the major networks or major newspapers They are going on every political forum on reddit and posting it and trying to push it hard on Twitter  
PoliticalDiscussion,They can start by believing the accuser and calling him a rapist the way they did with Kavanaugh They can stage an aggressive character assassination against Biden Then if you so much as question the credibility of the accuser they can call you sexist  If they take their values about always believing women seriously that is how they will act 
PoliticalDiscussion,You come across very sane and principled in this post 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s actually pointless because no one with principles wants to vote for a guy with a credible assault accusations 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty hard to do a job when they won t let you in the building  
PoliticalDiscussion,AHAHAHAHAHA PROOF not shit pushed by Trump or Bernie CULTISTS  It s sad that a  recovering heat attack victim that is NOT a FUCKIN Democrat has so many looking so sad that they ACTUALLY look like FOOLS NOTHING he promises would EVER get implemented in their lifetimes and they re willing ONCE AGAIN to FUCK up the country because they re a bunch of whiny babies that can t accept defeat Up to this point BEFORE becoming the Democratic nominee the man had NO one saying anything but how nice the guy was but you Bernie folks I actually think you re worse than Trump supporters because I KNOW what to expect from THEM are blind Lemmings when ALL you had to do was VOTE    You LOST now go back to your basements or dorm rooms because all you all do is TALK ONLINE 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because those candidates dropped out and Sanders has not None of those candidates performed well either Harris didn t even make it to primaries 
PoliticalDiscussion,The party establishment in SC is run by black people That s why Clyburn s endorsement was so huge  I d say the guy with a credible rape allegation is more divisive than Bernie but maybe you have different opinions on sexual assault perpetrators
PoliticalDiscussion,A stutter doesn t make you forget basic facts about what state you re in or the name of the president you served under for eight years 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion, I m an Obidenbama democrat  
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine supporting a rapist and calling other people cultists 
PoliticalDiscussion, Believe all women means take allegations seriously not assume they re true if the evidence contradicts 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Virginia Governor had a lot of pressure to resign when the story broke but black voters overwhelmingly supported him staying in office and that was pretty much the end of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not a big AOC fan but if she primaries Gillibrand I  support her Gillibrand got rid of a fantastic Senator for a pure power play which failed miserably she deserves to lose in  because of this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Quick question who is my guy 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Mormons will drown out blue voters Mormons fuck a lot and have lots of kids 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I know Bloody lunatics   gt There are a lot of people who think he s doing a great job 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but it seems much worse in Biden especially in regards to speaking but that might be his stutter  than the ither candidates
PoliticalDiscussion,Also an ESS poster Goddamn I m impressed you don t stink of reactionary bullshit NEARLY as much as your friends do I really got the impression you were pro Biden rather than rabidly anti Bernie But if your ideology is so dedicated to hating one man in American politics who isn t even the president I ll have to kindly ask you to go back to the horrific subreddit you frequent

PoliticalDiscussion,Not only is no one caring about Biden with the virus on everyone s mind but I doubt we see another bill for at least a month Remember Mitch just sent the Senate home  till the th Unless something has happened I Doubt he is rescinding that call 
PoliticalDiscussion,She tweeted in support of Tulsi and Bernie but never Warren Her statement of having being a Warren supporter is another dubious claim contradicted by public information  The extent of her support of Warren was trying to use the campaign to back her allegations 
PoliticalDiscussion,I said  sincere  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Except both of them have literally campaigned on isolationism  Which does make you anti interventionist  Damn this is stupid Trumps actions aren t isolationist Moving troops from Syria to Iraq and attacking foreign leaders isnt isolationists Certainly isn t anything Bernie would do He wants to decrease our military budget end conflicts we started no more coups and so forth In fact he has a career of advocating intervention only in the exact circumstances described   If you have a citation of him saying he s going to isolate us I m all ears

PoliticalDiscussion, gt In  she was still operating on the advice of her family Biden is powerful man and you should forget about it The social landscape has since changed  Fair enough   gt From what I understand she wanted to speak about this last year but people minimized the sexual harassment and she got scared off According to her she went to Times Up recently to get help coming forward and they turned her away   And from what I understand she initially reported that Biden acted somewhat weird towards her but that there was  nothing sexual about it And now several months later she changes her story  This whole thing deserves to be investigated and if true Biden needs to drop out But there s an awful lot here that makes me suspicious and the timing is just one of those things

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Everyone knows Trump is fucking this all up  This is so false it hurts There are a  lot of people who think he s doing a great job 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe Biden was the VP for the previous Democratic President who was massively popular and the vast majority of older people who don t follow politics outside of cable TV are voting for him Last I checked Biden was polling over  with people over  while Bernie was polling over  with people under   In short the reason why Biden is winning is because he has name recognition and the voting block that only consumes cable TV which is always favorable coverage for the establishment and a blackout of the left views it as a civic duty to vote while it seems to be significantly harder to motivate Sanders young base to vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there a way to see ip history on  user accounts without a subpoena 
PoliticalDiscussion,So I ve started looking at post history recently on accounts I need to make a chart These  accounts above  have been dormant for  months and all of a sudden they start posting again Of the  accounts that I have looked at today that post controversially it s always between  and  months since last post Prior to dormancy it s pretty regular post history   
PoliticalDiscussion,If you ask antifa they would dissagree they describe themselfes as leftist communist And saying  there aren t super violent leftists is just dishonest There is an extreme on all sides be it right left or center Damn there are even violent green party people It s pretty easy to say that those of the left who act like hobby  stalin fanboys are not left but those from the right who act like hobby  hitler fanboys are totaly rightwing Either we re going to look on the full picture or we re going to have a problem after we dealt with only one side Because guess who AntiFa will fight against once they  defeated their eternal enemy If you go to any AntiFa gathering to websites or talk to them yourself you ll find out that they want to destroy our system in the end since it isn t  fair  So once we helped them to  defeat fascism  that s impossible anyways because ideas can t be defeated it ll only drive them underground and honestly  who wants a secret order of fascists  they will turn to us and demand change So either we look at both sides or we ll have a problem sooner or later Or what also might happen due to the  illegalization of right wing ideals we might have another s germany in a bigger sense Do We Want That Do we have to make the same mistakes every single century 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea of  more years of trump and Republicans is pretty scary 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Do we seriously want people to miss out on cancer treatment or cardiovascular care   I don t get it  lol no you wouldn t miss out on it But instead of paying all out for every type of health care option you could select a  brand of insurance that fits your chronic condition I e why would you pay more for cancer treatment if you don t have cancer but you have cardiovascular issues So wouldn t you just pick a plan that almost solely focuses on cardiovascular plans Does that make sense   gt The U S Spends   Per Person on Health Care Administrative Costs Canada Spends   Here s Why   Yeah it is due to the astronomical administrative costs and malpractice costs Multipayer systems do not have administrative costs similarly to Single payer    xB  The benefit of multipayer is that the government does not have total control and you as a citizen are able to pick your insurance  also consider the fact that a future presidents congressman can alter the paying cost under a single payer since they have total control multi payer provides a check and balance backbone which limits corruption  The health care industry can still benefit through competitive insurances but the overall power that the insurance companies have now will be significantly reduced It also enables the continuity of innovation whereas many single payer countries lack extensive research and innovation funding   A single payer system would kill so many jobs Research administration private sector jobs so what happens to them Do those people not matter as well A multi payer system would at least provide a balance The administrative workers would take a hit but the other  would take less of a hit  In the end both systems would significant decrease the costs spent on healthcare here in the US and would ensure universal healthcare Single payer would provide slightly more savings but you also lose more flexibility and intuitiveness win the process Personally I think the US system could more easily transition to a multi system style which would mean that insurance could potentially be offered more efficiently then trying to force the full  with a single payer   Single payer could also be  tiered  i e Medicare and Medicare Advantage  You would still have that additional option without taking away from people with just the basic plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,I remember well when the terms  neo conservative and  new Left appeared in America I and many others knew precisely the pernicious intent of  neo  and I for one    refused   to use both terms and I stopped the discussion in it s tracks when others used them in my presence   nbsp I raised holy hell when those on the right adopted the term  neo con and was confirmed in my position when  new Left appeared I continue to do this and with respect to someone using  new Left  I would stop the discussion and ask  Don t you mean neo Left  I love doing that

PoliticalDiscussion,The key point is that the USA does not just have a universality problem in health care  They have an outcomes problem  The health outcomes are poor  And they have a cost problem  Health care is expensive  Just addressing universality does not solve health care  Health care is currently  of GDP verus say  in Australia  Life expectancy is actually declining for a couple of years in a row in a booming economy   gt  gt There is nothing so stupid as tying health insurance to employers   gt In theory the idea is that this will encourage others to get jobs and thus boost the economy   Which theory  Is there anyone on the planet who buys that    gt Single payer systems are notorious for extremely long wait times  Some systems do have that problem  Ironically for us we found waiting times higher in the USA  I am fine with people just paying out of pocket for services  However this does not need any government intervention in terms of insurance  And I think you will find without government subsidies private insurance will disappear  And I don t see how you justify massive subsidies for the very richest peopl   gt  I am paying more in taxes without consent than other Americans  You do get special lanes on the roads  First class seats on buses   gt Or different plans would offer different benefits for different chronic conditions  maybe one plan provides better coverage for cancer treatment whereas another plan would provide better coverage for cardiovascular treatments  Do we seriously want people to miss out on cancer treatment or cardiovascular care   I don t get it  The key point is that multi payer system are about taking dollar bills and lighting them up  They cost more money for the same care   gt  It would require more oversight and effort to maintain but it would prevent total bureaucratic control from completely sinking the health care system      gt The U S Spends   Per Person on Health Care Administrative Costs Canada Spends   Here s Why
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess but Bernie has been outspending Biden and has a bigger ground game and has been campaigning for  years now
PoliticalDiscussion,Not just any federal judge he was one of the major people on one of the most important circuit courts afaik 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden has long been seen as a champion of women  I have never ever heard a single person call Biden a  champion of women  he has been praised for his good ties to the African American community for being a loyal VP for being a committed bipartisan etc but  champion for women is not something I ve ever heard or could even justify with his past record He shafted Anita Hill and opposed the Hyde amendment for decades literally what he done for women s rights that wasn t the party consensus 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt    a large population of followers The principle use of  alt right includes literal Nazi and white supremacy groups who self branded and who exist in significant numbers   nbsp Please quantify in approximation  large population and  significant numbers and in which nations 
PoliticalDiscussion,Political correctness is alt left 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dropping it last year would have been the right time if your goal was to end Biden s campaign  But if your goal was to help Bernie Sanders win the nomination post Super Tuesday is when it would have made the most sense It would have been better a few weeks ago than a few days ago but it appears to have taken a while for her to find a willing platform 
PoliticalDiscussion,They don t Trump s endgame is to declare himself king and establish the US as a patriarchal monarchy  Trump
PoliticalDiscussion,I am a Democratic Socialist and the Alt left doesn t really make sense as a label Due to McCarthyism and neoliberal takeover in the s we don t really have a leftist party in the United States The Democratic Party is left on social policies but close to the center on economic policy It just appears to be a label that is used to condemn leftists by comparing them to the alt right I guess this term would be applied to Antifa and commentators like Chapo but they re no politicians that have such left leaning policies Even Bernie Sanders who claims to be a Democratic Socialist has a Social Democratic agenda on par with many European countries 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bloomberg will be throwing money for the Dem campaign though  Well not directly but there will be an enormous PAC  
PoliticalDiscussion,I admire your hope that people will hold trump accountable I predict they ll find a way to blame democrats for all of this and win in November I m tired of everything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Meanwhile The Donald continues lying holds aid from Michigan because the Governor can actually formulate thoughts and speak and has American blood on his hands for thinking that we are immune to what ills the rest of the world Really Trump and the Republicans lowered the bar and kept lowering it 
PoliticalDiscussion, is going to be hard because they d need to retain MI AL and NH and win  senate seats on top of that to get an outright majority There s no chance they keep hold of AL imo MI and NH should stay blue and current polling trends there are favorable to dems CO AZ NC MT and ME are all possible pickups but the Dems certainly won t turn all of those seats blue NC and MT are going to be specially hard The  GA seats IA and KY are also potential flips but IA loves incumbents and is trending blue GA is still reddish and who knows what s going to happen in KY last I heard the state despises McConell but also hates Democrats more  What makes me hopeful is that a lot of what went right for the democratic party in  is also looking to go right for them in  high turnout and Biden s down ballot effect may carry them over the line in a lot of these states which could be massive 
PoliticalDiscussion,Italy has an infant mortality rate of about  and the USA has about   Their life expectancy is about  years longer  And I don t think this driven by smarter health care  I expect it is driven by the massive inequality in the USA  I bet the riches  of americans do better than Italians  The rest maybe not  I have a horrible feeling we are about to get another comparison of italian and american health care  I really hope america does well 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m fully aware of his disastrous media appearances   
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly IMO  is probably Schumer best chance of being senate majority leader 
PoliticalDiscussion,I actually think Gillibrand made a huge political miscalculation She thought that by going after Franken she would be a National hero and dominate the feminist vote that later was split between Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and it backfired spectacularly Gillibrand was doing worse than Marianne Williamson You would think a New York senator would be able to get above  or   
PoliticalDiscussion,He s going to have a tough road on condemning Trump and showing any strength on this issue at all  He tried to hit Trump over CDC funding Joe is attached to reducing CDC funding  of the  years in office as VP  Also  Luhan Virus   Damn Joe s a mess 
PoliticalDiscussion,Italy has universal health care  Italy  
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie has made  million  in campaign donations   And now is asking people out of work to make more donations to coronavirus relief 
PoliticalDiscussion,When did you forget that the single payer idea has been around since Hillary as FLOTUS and before Or do you think Sanders came up with those ideas all on his own The state of Vermont had single payer it failed COVID is hitting countries with national health coverage Have you heard what has happened to Italy lately 
PoliticalDiscussion,Barely if at all People who like Biden will continue to like him and support his proposed policies People who like Trump will continue to support his policies and Trump will act accordingly Trump and Biden will do what they want and would probably choose to die rather than take advice from each other I can t imagine that this speech would have any impact on how Trump handles this pandemic And it s not like the general public is going to start claiming Joe Biden is a person that everybody should put faith and trust in the majority of democrats won t even advocate for him given the recent occurrences   So IMO basically not at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Schumer and Pelosi are doing more important work than Sanders Has Sanders put put a signature bill yet He hasn t like ever 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes being a federal judge makes you nationally prominent Sure most people won t be able to name a single national judge but most people can t name their own member of congress 
PoliticalDiscussion,For the TLDR Yes the photo is real so is the kissing story Both were from comedy sketches they performed on tour She cowrote the kissing sketch 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is why he has been doing interviews if you bothered to pay attention before you added that chestnut 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her allegation in  said it was not a sexual encounter so that already takes a lot of the wind from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Running a campaign during a crisis like COVID which is a global pandemic that we haven t seen before kinda is more what is on peoples minds Trump is on everyday screwing the pooch What would Biden say that we already don t know about his opponent Besides you don t put a POTUS on blast during a time of national crisis You save it for when it s time to punch 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also Tara Raede said in  that she did not take the encounter as sexual so this is also a big change
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not denying that but it ll still probably be the only chance Schumer will ever have at being senate majority leader and he ll want to stick around for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,JFC WTF Where do you get your politics from Biden isn t senate majority leader or speaker of the house Biden was like VP when we had Ebola the recession and the push for the ACA 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  map is entirely dependent on who won the presidency If Trump won the Democratic are in a great spot for  if Biden win  is going to be awful for Democrat The opposition almost alway win the midterm 
PoliticalDiscussion,Think my favorite use of it is  Having the presidential popular vote and  will get you a McChicken  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Do you have reading sources on these groups  Of course they don t They have a vivid imagination 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes apparently having strong ethics and a desire for people to be treated as more than animals is now attacking There are valid reasons to be angry Hell everyone should be angry right now at our government It has completely failed us and it s time to make some serious changes As a whole we have been too complacent for far too long 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alright take a break and review the civility rule 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bloomberg got in the game late and the money spent actually garnered him national recognition and support that he didn t have prior to throwing the hat into the ring Now he can just load up on his anti Trump campaign which Trump has given a lot of ammo with his handling of COVID Steyer spent cash way before running and now everyone knows who he is These guys running for POTUS  increased their value It s money spent that gives them a positive ROI 
PoliticalDiscussion,None of which makes them nationally prominent

PoliticalDiscussion,Not in the aggregate of polls he does not 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be fair after he won the nomination and the virus became big news    he disappeared for about a week So ya I think he lost a lot of momentum 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you have a source for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,But doesn t Biden have Bloomberg on is side I wouldn t think funds would be an issue As soon as he is nominated if he is I expect to see big flashy ads all over the place I could be wrong but it makes sense to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,He also forgot to do his job and vote so there s that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is Joe Biden the guy that quit running for president once it was clear he was the nominee That play come from the ol Clinton playbook 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is this really common sense This also makes her a Russian asset even if she is telling the proof and has evidence  Also what is Biden going to do that Putin should be so afraid of Syria is basically over The Ukranian situation has changed and the Maidan revolution is losing steam What is Biden planning on doing that Russia is meant to be so afraid of 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt She s a Russian asset because she s trying to damage the presidential candidate that s going to be tougher on Vladimir Putin This is common sense  So if you attack a candidate that s tougher on something you re immediately an asset of that thing  If Bernie is tougher on billionaires than Biden and Biden attacks Bernie is Biden a billionaire asset Because I suspect if the Biden campaign went around saying that he s a billionaire asset his support among Democrats would absolutely tank 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why are you assuming she s talking about the same incident Here It seems to me that she was just providing one example of what it s like working with Joe Biden but didn t want to just casually come out with accusing a senator and presidential candidate of sexual assault  It is in no way surprising that she has previously talked about how joe biden made inappropriate contact with her but she is now deciding to talk about the sexual assault I would assume that if Biden ever did assault a woman he probably also did the weird touchy feely stuff to her as well and that the victim would be much more comfortable talking about how creepy it is when he touched her  Which everyone knows about rather than talk about sexual assault and face attacks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I hope he doesn t Dick Durbin would be the majority leader if Chuck Schumer isn t and Durbin is in my opinion an all around stronger senator and leader Given a majority I trust Durbin to deliver on a Democratic agenda and keep the caucus in line a lot more than I trust Schumer to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Federal judges aren t prominent because the word  federal is in the job title They preside over huge cases with far reaching consequences The courts have an immense amount of power in the American political system and the SCOTUS only works on so many cases a year A lot of big cases or controversial rulings don t make it to the supreme court 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree wholeheartedly We cannot cripple our system for an ideal Things have to be moved slowly or we risk a collapse 
PoliticalDiscussion,If a person changes something innocuous they ve maintained for literally decades suddenly to a gigantic unsupported and highly dubious allegation  rape in a public setting  and they also are both  shitty and show extremely poor judgement it casts massive doubt on whether or not they are telling the truth  There is a reason why con men aren t typically put on the witness stands in trials 
PoliticalDiscussion,If it s not properly investigated into during the primary I think it ll do the majority of it s damage in the general where republicans will really weaponize it And if you don t think it ll stick just remember there s a ton of creepy videos of Biden being too touchy feely What I m personally worried about is a lesser of two evils situation Dems don t win that game it just creates voter apathy  ie both parties are the same mentality and could result in lower turn out in the general  This is the best possible time for the DNC to change course if this ends up being true 
PoliticalDiscussion, Link for the lazy  
PoliticalDiscussion,But they often simply report that someone else reported it They can note that it s uncorroborated and then discuss it for  minutes anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a medical student myself I do agree with you and that is my current concern with the adjustment to a new system There are lots of underlying problems that can t be automatically fixed by cutting out administrative and private insurance costs It would help but it is a systematic error and I think the government would focus on funding k and undergraduate loans way before they touch on medical school loans   Any system would take YEARS
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve heard a lot of terms The one I tend to use refers to a very specific group in the democratic party I call them  The Regressive Left   They are the ones that claim they want equality but in reality want minority dominance and oppression for the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I agree 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re not fooling anyone with your lies  Nothing I ve said it s untrue   gt So in the end you are just daft  You can t be civil can you You just have to emulate the example that Trump sets in resorting to dishonesty and insults   If you re average income the only reason that you are getting  is because of the Democrats    gt giving people a pay raise during this crises and six months after just encourages people to be slow getting back to work  No it doesn t Getting a pay raise for working provides greater incentive to work If someone is slow to return to work then they miss out on more income   And  slow to return to work    Dude you re missing the whole point in your hating on those low income workers getting slightly more per hour There aren t going to be jobs for people to get back to People aren t going to be out of work because they re choosing not to work get out of your bubble 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the cost of healthcare is free then it must be done in such a way that doctors do not drown in debt The price of medical malpractice insurance is very high the price to get a degree is ludicrous the job is already high stress with long hours   If you think there is a healthcare crisis now imagine one in which most of the doctors are in different fields because we decided their service should change and adjusted the pay so the government could afford it   Also if rent is frozen how does the person that own s the land pay for food For some that is the whole of their income and it pays just enough to live from paycheck to paycheck  Where I will agree with you is that testing should be free If you do it in mass it will flatten out the cost dramatically Honestly they should be testing as often as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Federal judges aren t nationally prominent unless they re SCOTUS or they re presiding over a newsworthy case Postal workers are feds and I m going to guess you don t know what every one of them is up to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only for Bernie apparently
PoliticalDiscussion,She s a Russian asset because she s trying to damage the presidential candidate that s going to be tougher on Vladimir Putin This is common sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,True which is why the inability to gain the votes from people with principles is a problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Votes from people without principles count the same as votes from people with principals  unless they re in different states  
PoliticalDiscussion,So you think she is a Russian asset because you disagree with her opinion on Putin 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t have to be on Putin s payroll to be a Russisn asset 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but a federal judge is still a very powerful and not exactly anonymous person 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s a huge difference between being a  federal judge and one of the  justices on SCOTUS 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They don t recall Trump claiming China had it under control and it was nothing to worry about  China has it under control It s Trump who hasn t got it under control He called it a hoax as did Fox and his crony newspapers China s population dwarfs Americas but already American cases exceed China s Not enough preparation tough decisions avoided rapid spread little or no containment deaths You are poorly led and as a population you seem unable to grasp the severity of the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,A hold w NO INTEREST on student loan payments
PoliticalDiscussion,If you don t have the means then don t donate Trump has a significant fundraising headstart so I don t really know if Biden has the luxary to not fundraise optics be damned
PoliticalDiscussion,Why does Trump get to accuse the democrats of literal treason for not clapping at his state of the union but no one is allowed to talk bad about the right because  decorum  Trump spent weeks calling this virus  that have killed thousands and grinded the economy to a halt If I was his opponent  I wouldn t let anyone forget that just because I m afraid to get my hands dirty That s partially why we re in this mess
PoliticalDiscussion,Russia is one of our many rivals We attack them all the time they attack us all the time same with China DPRK Iran Venezuala and like  other countries  And what is  strange about it exactly What is your theory That she is a FSB agent That she was contacted by the FSB to smear Biden  I can understand people being sceptical scepticism can be good But that s not what you re doing You re jumping to  she s a Russian agent which is so much more paranoid and ridiculous than  she s lying  Which is also what you re saying 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Maybe so but the reality is a sizable portion of the electorate will see attacks by Biden as partisan hits in a time of National Emergency   You mean the portion that s gonna vote Trump over Biden anyway Domt see why that matters
PoliticalDiscussion,they did expand their coalition didn t they the Hispanic vote that delivered California and Nevada and increased the vote in Texas wasnt there in  It just wasn t enough to make up for other elements of the  Coalition  the anti Hillary but not necessarily pro Bernie vote peeling off for more moderate candidates
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Also doesn t help how gleeful a lot of Sanders supporters seem to be and trying to their best to push a certain agenda   Its  really disgusting how happy Sanders supporters about this It s very much a  now you  have to vote for our guy  vibe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe so but the reality is a sizable portion of the electorate will see attacks by Biden as partisan hits in a time of National Emergency It may not be right but that is how it will be perceived and as such is not smart politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,What Bush won his reelection bid 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not a formal endorsement but may as well have been   
PoliticalDiscussion,Presidents approval ratings always go up in a crisis Thing is trumps bump in approval is much smaller than previous crisis presidents I don t have a source off the top of my head but I can find one if you d like 
PoliticalDiscussion,People under  don t vote Bernie is terrible with older black voters who represent the base of the Democratic Party Nobody cares how well you do with people who don t vote   If you think Clyburn was paid to endorse Biden you need to look internally and ask yourself some tough questions Maybe you should actually get off your computer and talk to black people Just because someone doesn t like Bernie doesn t mean they re brainwashed by the media 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know that we can interpret anything from her social media  People who work in politics are spinning social media all the time  It s part of how you present yourself to the world    There are lots of reasons why victims don t report sexual harassment   especially when the person is in a position of power within their profession or industry  In  Ms Reade wouldn t have been taken seriously  The Anita Hill hearings  which Biden was leading illustrate how flawed things were for women bringing forth these types of allegations  If Reade said positive things about Biden on social media that means nothing other than her allegiance to her party  Isn t that why everyone is saying  vote blue no matter who   If Reade hadn t publicly supported Biden in the past she probably would have faced stiff criticism  Reade tried to bring this up in January and Times Up refused to help  I think Ds should be looking to the DNC for answers rn  They ve been ignoring this issue with Biden s touching for a long time with many women speaking out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah he was in this to stroke his own ego not to save the country If he really wanted to help he would be a much less wealthy person 
PoliticalDiscussion,America is still by and large a conservative country If you only tally the votes in the Democratic primary for states that will likely go blue in November then Bernie does much better It just shows how far to the right most of the rest of the country is Additionally if we had all closed primaries I d be interested to see what the numbers would look like Because Bernie would lose votes from independents who aren t registered but Biden would lose formerly moderate Republicans who switched sides   This comparison is just supposed to illustrate my point I m not advocating for only allowing Democrats in states that vote Democrat in general elections to vote  Although I do think it s stupid that all  states have a different set of rules   
PoliticalDiscussion,Reportedly she approached Warren with the story and got turned away I feel like Warren would have absolutely run with it if she felt like it passed the smell test 
PoliticalDiscussion,Without going to an internet source can you name any of the circuit court judges in your circuit  I can t and I m a lot more politically literate than the average person  I know all of the supreme court judges and some of the nominees from the last two decades    The fact that judges are federal doesnt mean anything about the populaces awareness 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cuz that s what multipayer universal means right  Please go tell large amounts of Europe they are doing it wrong   
PoliticalDiscussion,He has been He had a healthcare provider roundtable call a few days ago    
PoliticalDiscussion,So we just subsidize health insurance companies not actual care Got it
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean I wondered that personally and didn t see any memes  Though I also thought what an opportunity for a meme
PoliticalDiscussion,Wait   So you re saying because every Klansman neo Nazi etc   in America didn t show up then the rally was  not organized by them That makes not a lick of sense They got permits from the city they did the Rikki torch March through the University campus shouting  blood and soil and  Jews will not replace us  they had guest speakers organized marches  I mean just watch the footage of the event There s plenty of it        And I m being slanderous   lt shocked Pikachu face gt  
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe needs green screen tech He can come to us from exciting locales 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the part where she told two people about it when it happened in  and they corroborated it  Story from l last year is about a different instance than the one where he forcibly inserted his finger into her vagina  Really disgusting to see that you think rape is okay as long as the victim liked Putin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you mean that you don t know that  neo  is supposed to conjure the image of and associated revulsion for the neo Nazi This is    precisely   the reason for the term  neo con   short for  neo conservative   and the avoidance of such an association with the term  new Left  
PoliticalDiscussion,I dont understand the  frozen rent thing  The more you look into it the more you re finding that all these banks landlords are doing is just allowing forbearance for a few months  Then they have to pay IN FULL the amount due  Which for some people would be impossible because there is no way you can just magically come up with  months worth of rent even if you were just unemployed for a month  It has to be forgiven to actually give people assistance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Up until reading what you ve posted today I always thought that the Charlottesville was NOT organized by the white supremacist and KKK I do some research on the event    nbsp Let s take the numbers posted today  for Charl rally and the SPLC numbers    KKK Let s add to the SPLC numbers those who are white supremacist and any other extremist  right of some other variety If the rally was ACTUALLY organized by the extreme right groups then  would mean that the rally THAT THEY ORGANIZED was very very POORLY attended in comparison to their total membership I bet that my long held understanding about that rally is correct and yours presently is incorrect If I m right then you have bought the slander perpetrated by the malicious people a k a the Left and US media they being the same 
PoliticalDiscussion,Russia gate is honestly just QAnon for liberals Anything that comes corpo Dems way they can just say it was Russia how pathetic
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but that issue you cited was more about corruption not about sexism The fact is that on the gender issue Clinton had no problems Not only does she support women in politics but she is one and she leaned heavily  unfortunately on the  I m with her slogan which I think put people off Those suburban white women didn t base their vote on anything having to do with a candidate s relation to women otherwise they would not have let a guy like Trump into office   Also Biden said he is committed to getting a woman VP as well which could deflect away from this stuff I don t think that this story given the climate it broke in would get alot of attention for obvious reasons People aren t talking about it they re talking about coronavirus and they are talking about the upcoming recession depression and they re talking about people losing their jobs and overloaded hospitals 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not possible to stay in the good graces of the Bernie wing  not going to let you monopolize the progressive label  I don t think you realize how crazy the Bernie hardcore actually sound because you ve normalized it  You couldn t even keep a stable coalition  within your own wing of the party  Can you picture how that looks to people in the right and centre Because to the centre left it s a real headscratcher The left keeps blaming others for not listening to them after cannibalizing themselves into oblivion   So here s the situation as you ve pretty much described already The Bernie hardcore are too unstable to reach out to The Warren progressives are not They can influence a malliable platform with Joe and get spammed with Snake emojis or sit it out and get spammed with snake emojis I think it s a no brainer  It s pretty clear that reaching out to progressives beyond putting Warren on the ticket is a complete waste of resources The ROI is ridiculous to get the Bernie hardcore on board The point they are satisfied is the point where a reluctant Trump  voter in Wisconsin feels sure they have to do it again Then on election day that reluctant Trump voter actually shows up and votes which clearly isn t as certain as that Bernie diehard who took the moon to get on board  When you learn to just do whatever you practically can do move the country left you ll actually succeed If Democrats kept winning elections  say from  to today we had Gore then Obama then HRC the world would be in a staggeringly better position and progressive policies would be far more palatable to the public and achievable to actually get done because the groundwork had been done But you keep complaining about not getting what you want at the snap of your fingers and then give up It s really sad 
PoliticalDiscussion,   Tldr general approval at   covid handling approval  
PoliticalDiscussion,What proven transgressions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zero effect
PoliticalDiscussion,Just fact checking you since you re heavily misinformed    
PoliticalDiscussion,I m
PoliticalDiscussion,The Democrats could have ran Jesus Christ and Reagan would still have won 
PoliticalDiscussion,What does that even mean   gt chip away at public option  Would they not see literally the same dilemma if ma was passed 
PoliticalDiscussion,For sure Even my Chinese friend was floored when Wuhan was closed As he was mentioning    city lockdown is not a thing in China since the Qing era 
PoliticalDiscussion,G l ll
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie s shown the same Raised massive amounts over the last six years but hasn t really come close to the nomination
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is a Trump show  It s  always a Trump show  I swear his talk about re opening early is just him running his mouth with something outrageous to get attention and rile up the base Will he bring disaster down on us  We ll see Stay tuned  
PoliticalDiscussion,CAN WE PLEASE NOT PUT THIS GENTLEMAN AS THE FRONTRUNNER  I love Biden from all the silly comedic videos he made with Obama I love his comforting anecdotes He should not run against the current infant in chief Seriously this is too important to have individuals this senile  on both sides represent our country Bernie at least has a quick wit and solid platform but even then I would say we need someone younger and stronger 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I agree but the critical factor is independent voters and by and large I think they would be turned off enough to not vote at all  or even vote Dem if and when the GOP starts openly mocking Duckworth 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes you think that your party is united 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hell this story is being pushed harder by Sanders supporters than right wing media  Exactly I WONDER WHY 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gillum was a terrible candidate to put up against DeSantis he appealed to no demographic in surprising numbers and he made many mistakes on the campaign Any other Floridian Democrat would have done better 
PoliticalDiscussion,She deserves nothing If the press can give the president  a pass on every single PROVEN transgression against women I have no problem giving Biden a pass on this  I will treat it as a political hit job by a political nut job Extraordinary claims call for extraordinary evidence Joe has a history of boundary issues but NO history of doing anything like this  He description of events sounds like cheap fiction anyway Not credible 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt testing should be free  Why not free if your doctor orders it otherwise you have to pay something  As I understand it many folks want a test but the results aren t necessary for treating them or tracking the spread OTOH maybe it s worth giving people a test if they want it just for their peace of mind Panicked worried people aren t helpful either 
PoliticalDiscussion,AL might be possible if Sessions wins Trump has been actively dumping on him 
PoliticalDiscussion,China never had it under control They still don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a crass joke that harmed no one Franken was a sacrificial lamb in a safe district the party could throw to the curb just so they could say  See We re different  
PoliticalDiscussion,Bloomberg has already shut down his operation and donated the rest of the money allocated for his campaign to the DNC  about  million    He s a slimeball If Democrats were really banking in his help they are in trouble 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Warren will do the trick to get you a bit more enthusiastic right  A bit but that s also just me someone who really likes Warren and has followed her career for over a decade  Most of the less politically savvy Sanders supporters I know are pretty incensed with her over what they see as her putting politics before integrity and at the moment most of those people are latching pretty hard to the new allegations which to them would make Warren accepting a VP slot another example of a willingness to put politics before integrity  If they were going to use her as a way to shore up the progressives they really should have done a better job of keeping her in the good graces of the progressive wing  I don t think you re right I think she was promised Secretary of Education over a month ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t have to win the majority of them back though it just requires a couple thousand in each state paired with the higher suburban turnout to beat Trump Hillary did the close to the worst she could have done in a region that she was hated Biden is not hated in the rust belt despite his pro free trade stances and he gets a bit more support in Michigan after he helped save the auto industry in  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He would not have locked the country down any sooner as we saw during HN   That is not comparable at all HN was not half a viral as COVID and had a death rate of   akin to the seasonal flu HN did not have a curve to flatten Shutting everyone in quarantine for a slightly worse version of the seasonal flu would ve been entirely unwarranted and can t really be used in the same argument regarding all the things Trump didn t do with COVID  
PoliticalDiscussion,Times Up has been doing free legal work for over two years now That excuses doesn t work 
PoliticalDiscussion,   I am deeply confused by your question The UTR rally was literally full of Klansman Nazis and various alt right groups and was literally organized by the guy who invented the term  alt right who is a self proclaimed white nationalist  I m not like being insulting or unfairly labeling these people I m using the language they call themselves and they re the ones who decided that  unite was a good title for their shindig 
PoliticalDiscussion,So we re victim blaming now
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh yeah those stupid snake emojis were fucking  inexcusable    I honestly think it s best for the world to build a coalition that excludes the toxic elements of both Trump s and Sanders followings  When Elizabeth Warren of all people started failing the purity tests I knew that chasing after the ride or die Bernie folks was absolute folly  In  I got really stressed about Bernie folks threatening to vote third party This time I m not stressed at all Good people who want to make a positive difference in this world know what they need to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,She went to the Times Up organisation a few months ago because now there s finally legal support for these kinds of accusations It makes sense that she didn t want to talk about this when it happens given how other similar accusations were treated It s even hard to come out and talk about these things now  And last year she gave a specific example of Biden acting inappropriately and described it that way 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are certainly chapters of antifa or groups that claim to be  antifa just like there are groups that consider themselves alt right even if that s a nebulous label at times Like I said they aren t large groups in comparison though that s why the label isn t particularly useful 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correction Bernie s doing terribly with older black voters He s doung wonderful with all demographics under  across the board including the  gt black vote  But if you re asking me why people who lived through the civil rights movement would rather vote for a segregationist over a covil rights activist who marxhed with and got arrested for MLK no I cannot fathom why that is other than Clyburn being paid to endorse Biden after co authoring bills with Bernie and a very well executed propaganda campaign by cable media 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except for the fact that people could say that hiding in your home is not presidential People could argue that a president puts his health second to policy for the country  You have to be honest and acknowledge that you would probably be criticizing Trump if he was making all of his speeches from the West wing There would be criticism that he cares more about his own personal health than the well being of the nation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Probably
PoliticalDiscussion,We were asking for leadership on this a month ago when it would ve mattered politically or at least a week ago before he disappeared Now he s a feckless politician with dementia
PoliticalDiscussion, gt About  people attended the infamous Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville in    nbsp I found  this defintion  webster    of alt right  gt  a right wing primarily online political movement or grouping based in the U S whose members reject mainstream conservative politics and espouse extremist beliefs and policies typically centered on ideas of white nationalism    nbsp What was the goal and stated or implied theme of the Charlottesville rally If it was to unite the right then I can t imagine that white supremacists KKK members and other extreme groups would negotiate their beliefs to be a part of that unity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie is still doing terribly with black voters which is actually the main reason why he s losing the primary  Most of his supporters still haven t reckoned with the reasons for that
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right Warren should ve endorsed the candidate who lost to Clinton by four million votes   You guys can t even make it past a primary If Biden can t beat Trump Bernie definitely can t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I was skeptical of Warren for endorsing the candidate that lost to Trump who was not the Democratic nominee at the time  This is why you guys lost to Trump and probably will again It s terrifying that the people who have all the political power in the party all agree with your warped interpretation of reality 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I m not suggesting any leftist groups would seriously considering naming themselves in the same fashion I was just using the term as a catch all for extreme and potentially violent leftist groups  of which there don t seem to be many of in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol You were skeptical of Warren for endorsing the  Democratic nominee This is why you guys keeps losing It s hilarious 
PoliticalDiscussion,are you one of those people who think the candidates with millions less votes would do better  Bernie supporters are so fascinating on how they can spin reality
PoliticalDiscussion,This is why I think it s Warren   Warren Democrats is a brand building exercise to help shore up your wing of the party The Biden Warren will be pitched as a unity ticket   That will do the trick to get you a bit more enthusiastic right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because of popular demand We had to pressure Bernie for months to enter the race People on the left have been skeptical of Warren ever since she endorsed Hillary Clinton 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sure it will   though maybe not to the extent it will hit cities   but you re right the economic impact on rural areas may be more severe  We ll just have to see how this will play out in the coming months 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a VIRUS IT AFFECTS THE WEALTHY AND NOT WEALTHY TOM HANKS GOT IT FOR HEAVENS SAKE AS WELL AS PRINCE FREAKIN CHARLES   The elderly and people with pre existing conditions have the higher mortality rate when it comes to COVID Italians had a worse mortality rate when the Mafia had all the power This is a health crisis not a health care crisis Doctors and nurses have died from it It was bound to happen as many have predicted and the crisis isn t becasue no one had free health care the crisis is we don t have enough infrastructure to handle the cases that are growing exponentially in numbers and we have an asshat in the White House Trump was impeached earlier this year and right after COVID happened Plus he dismantled the apparatus that was put in after Ebola and ignored all the warnings This country cannot take four more years of an insane POTUS I knew a recession would hit before the end of this year but America is resilient up to who wants to believe what Right now just stay safe keep well eat as healthy and live as healthy as one can and vote this asshat out and we will be fine As long as we don t have the Socialist Trump in office to replace the real Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Bernie pushed Warren to run in  why didn t he step aside in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh look it s one of those ESS trolls I was talking about earlier Nice  karma in that sub you have there   gt After Sanders told her a woman couldn t win and had his surrogates and supporters call her a snake  Except that s either a bold faced lie or a blatant misinterpretation of his words I find it hard to believe that the same man who aggressively pushed for Warren to run in  instead of him as the progressive candidate also told her that he thinks a woman can t be President And exactly why she s now known as toxic and exactly why Bernie s supporters called her a snake Because all of us who actually have the capacity for critical thinking see right through the bullshit 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m only familiar with the US and in any case I don t recall  alt right being anything but a US phenomenon  How many people though are  alt right  This is an excellent question and something nobody actually knows the answer to About  people attended the infamous Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville in  And the  SPLC   has estimated that there are between    active KKK members  Either way the  alt right have a noticable online presence but I would bet their media prominence is likely inflated to larger than their true size by themselves as well as the mainstream media who cover them perhaps excessively 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden also committed sexual assault 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not going low It s what happened Let the post live
PoliticalDiscussion,Warren voters are voting They re all voting for Biden   Bernie didn t make an attempt to get her endorsement Or anyone else s That s why nobody else is voting for him   And Warren was the one whose toxic After Sanders told her a woman couldn t win and had his surrogates and supporters call her a snake   I m so happy you guys lost You have no place running the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lack of self awareness is what you re not aware of 
PoliticalDiscussion,We don t want Joe Biden quit trying to force him on us like he forced himself on women 
PoliticalDiscussion,Given that it didn t seem to be a factor against her at all in her  race it s really hard to imagine New Yorkers caring about this a lot by  
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no   split in the party among progressives and centrists Currently between people who are voting between Biden and Sanders yes but the entire progressive vote up until Warren dropping out has been   with the progressives having the edge Warren s voters simply aren t voting now because Warren has developed an intense hatred of Bernie for whatever reason and the Warren camp and Sanders camp after all of Warren s toxicity on and off the debate stage have an intense hatred for each other  Plus you ve failed to include all of the registered Dems who don t vote The party s preferred candidate is  none of the above once we include them In other words a more honest interpretation of the primary is that we have a    split with young people making up the vast majority of the  and  portions That s not winning turnout in the general election if all you can manage to turn out is the same age demographic that voted for Trump last time and only turn out  of everyone else If that doesn t worry you it should 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes he raped her and she didn t want to accuse him out of fear of repercussions  Why does she suddenly not fear repercussions now as opposed to the multiple times over the last year when she spoke about this incident and never once called it assault and even claimed it  wasn t sexual  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the crisis bump People rally around the flag after a national disaster It wears off quickly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you mean that you don t know the implied reference of  neo   and don t know the reason the Left used  new instead of  neo  
PoliticalDiscussion,I was quite happy to see her campaign crumble into a million pieces There weren t many Democratic candidates I actively rooted against but she earned my ire 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve read that a few places as well I guess we re finding out why a lot of places aren t running with this story 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you explain which part of the allegation is credible Is it the part where her story changed in the past year from  Biden put his hand on my back but it wasn t sexual to  He raped me  Or is it the part where she praises Putin for some reason Or is it credible simply because you prefer Bernie to win 
PoliticalDiscussion, Here   are the national numbers Biden     Here   is Wisconsin Statistical tie    Here   is PA Biden      Here   is Ohio There isn t enough info but Biden leads the sparse polling there   Biden is also leading in NC and AZ   And mind you  some of these polls were taken while Trump was getting favorable polling for his Covid handling  The Fox News poll for example gives Trump a favor handling of the crisis but when asked about who they are voting for Biden   It s a pretty interesting dynamic 
PoliticalDiscussion,again spin it how you want but the   split you can t argue
PoliticalDiscussion, gt All that being said it seems odd that her story changed from touchy to full on sexual assault I think that s where a lot of people are attacking her credibility  And that before  her social media seemed to indicate that she was something of a fan of Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed Purity politics are trash A lot of good came from the metoo movement but this is an example of power mongering bullshit on Gillibrand s part   For their sake I m glad even liberal groups have turned their back on her 
PoliticalDiscussion,No not really He is losing at larger margins than he did in  You can cherry pick whatever groups you want but it doesn t matter against the big picture 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Bidens surge was from the dropping out of like candidates  Certainly also part of it   gt Reddit loves Bernie  Lol not based on the vast majority of people I interact with I d say Twitter loves him but certainly not Reddit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Care to elaborate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Twist things however you want but the reality is the progressive candidates combined polled around  of the dem party and the regular dems polled at roughly    Bidens surge was from the dropping out of like candidates  Reddit loves Bernie the rest of the Dem party doesn t  That is a fact and why he is doing so poorly with minimal effort from Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neo just means new Neonatal is newborn for example 
PoliticalDiscussion,What I think   If she really was staffer since    Then the Pro Russia comments are less suspicious and more just disturbing    She had two previous attempts to accuse him when he was running as Obama s running mate Biden couldn t do anything to her even if he wanted to  Her choosing post Super Tuesday after most of the candidates dropped out  makes me think the accusation is false or she did get sexually assaulted but is weaponizing it for Political Purposes  Inb someone says what about Ford  Kavanaugh previous nomination isn t something that would garner the attention a Scotus position or Cabinet Position would Ford also does not have insight into Trump s nomination process so she couldn t exactly accuse him before the nomination happened    The outlet she chooses to run her story  Vox Vox is the left wing equivalent of the Blaze I m left wing and even I don t pay attention to Vox because I know the articles won t be non partisan She should have went to New Yorker NYT or WaPo They could have vetted her story   Her stories appear to be contradicting
PoliticalDiscussion,Again there are people dying in countries who have a national health care plan One kid dying because he didn t have insurance isn t any different from people who have insurance dying because they died from COVID like they are in Europe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hence my point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Part of the  MeToo movement is changing the nature of our society Instead of burying these allegations crimes for decades we need immediate investigations I hope it works   What it has  partially devolved into is a guilty until proven innocent mentality It s muddied the waters This is not good   Al Franken was forced to step down IMO they viewed him as collateral damage and crucified him Was his behavior acceptable Not really Did it rise to the level of sexual assault or harassment No in my opinion   And now with this situation we are trusting the media to scrutinize Ms Reade s account Maybe that s why major outlets aren t picking up on it   And that scrutiny needs to go both ways I don t want to get into bashing her there are plenty of other sources you can use to do so   People are weaponizing and choosing to believe her account not because they are horrified by her story but because it s politically convenient   Is it a coincidence Sanders subs are screaming about this story at the top of their lungs Or are they pushing an agenda  That s not scrutinizing anything   This is the toxic part of these accusations we as a society need to reckon with 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know what you meant but it doesn t matter when it comes to election dollars when a lobbyist is working a few members of congress who already won their elections without a ton of cash Sanders gets money from people he promises shit he won t get done like ever with a  trillion price tag That isn t a sound policy with that number attached with it because it s like almost the entire economy and then some So sure he gets dollars from his online and social media campaigns Guess what Biden beat him soundly with almost no cash left in campaign dollars 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is a health crisis not a health care crisis  In situations like this they are one in the same health crisis will test a nations healthcare system  this is especially true in the U S were people will straight uop not go to the doctor if they feel sick because of the cost A teen who s death may be due to the virus was turned away due to lack of insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,It really is a great article
PoliticalDiscussion,Aren t they all getting away with them already 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with you there It s easy to lead the masses when you control what can and cant be seen online  big tech and when your buddies own the news media s  That s the scary thing is that extreme  alt left is becoming normal because it s easy to advertise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wrong again  
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say advertising for communism in the US would be considered alt left Those people   those people are dumb 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah they voted for Biden who won almost every state after Super Tuesday   As far as the rest of the world they don t vote form Sanders either 
PoliticalDiscussion, Most   have already been fired Hate to say it but he was never going to be the savior of the Democratic Party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is the rest of the world grown up    
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see where you re coming from If one person gets away with a crime then  all people should get away with crimes   
PoliticalDiscussion,Dead on 
PoliticalDiscussion,I meant corporate money and his plans seem very real and plausible to me Maybe you could enlighten yourself to them  
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be one thing if it were just that  but even when she was initially critical of Biden s personal space encroachment she pretty clearly stated that his behavior was non sexual Her various stories and narratives as they have shifted over the past decade are something we just take into consideration when trying to evaluate the veracity of her claims 
PoliticalDiscussion,It just seems odd that she was banking on Biden to lose and once it became apparent he was going to win she came forward 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no alt left  The term refers to a resurgence of violent fascism in the right wing  There is no such corresponding surge of violence in the left wing  The existence of the alt right is a function of their status as social outsiders and the left doesn t ostracize folks like that  I m far far far leftist 
PoliticalDiscussion,This has brought out the ugliest in the centrists  I legit figured they would respond better than this  Biden needed to get out in front of this quickly and he didn t now his supporters are basically going mask off conservative with the victim blaming and accusations of lying  It s funny to me how these are the people who were getting on the left about  civility just a few short weeks ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,There can be no investigation It s a cold case sexual assault allegation There is no physical evidence There is nothing but the word of the accuser and the accused How do people not get this by now Why can t we simply hold people in positions of great responsibility to a higher standard If you are credibly accused of sexual assault you should not hold federal office It s not that you are automatically guilty just because you are accused It s that we can easily find someone better without the stain of a credible accusation The standard of evidence required to convict someone of a crime is completely inappropriate here  Elected office is not a right afforded to people whose resumes check all the right boxes it s a privilege that can and should be withheld for even the slightest transgressions or appearance thereof 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh for fuck sake the old  get money out of politics thing is as old as politics itself He still needs cash no matter where it comes from and like  trillion of it which means he doesn t have a real plan he just plays the politics of grievance Sanders is an old hippie running a vanity campaign No one ever heard of him because he was just an easy vote yes for the Dems Hillary Clinton pushed single payer as FLOTUS did more in politics than he has and he goes after the low hanging fruit of the youth vote who don t even know that his ideas aren t  progressive because they are Liberal ideas already put out into the public discourse and think Liberals are Centrists Sanders is a charlatan he doesn t have the support he thought with actual soles on the ground instead they live on social media and getting their politics from Facebook and when they grow up and have to pay taxes they will forget who Sanders was because they grow up period 
PoliticalDiscussion,And Bernie still lost 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a Sanders supporter and I m disgusted by it too I wanted Sanders to win the nomination by winning people over to MA I don t want him to win because Biden implodes Sanders winning by default is going to make for an incredibly weak candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Word of the day optics  Nobody is going to care that you guys find Ford more credible they re going to see you believing women who accuse R s and calling women who accuse D s liars 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no evidence It s a sexual assault allegation from  years ago There is absolutely nothing but the victim s word same as with Ford same as with almost every sexual assault cold case The only  evidence anyone gives a shit about is obviously whether or not they like the politics of the accused 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nah the media is  owned by Bloomberg   That s just a fact  You centrists need to start figuring out your optics before they strangle you like they did in  
PoliticalDiscussion,She s getting a lot of air time on msnbc I think the Biden campaign is testing how well she s received from her air time and handling of the virus I personally think she s at the top of the list just by virtue of never seeing her before and now seeing her almost daily on the news And her state is pivotal to the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,The true colors are really showing now OP was totally right about how ugly this is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dude there s nothing to investigate That s the nature of cold case sexual assault allegations The only evidence is the victim s word and corroboration by people she told at the time It s not and will never be enough evidence to convict anyone in a court of law It is up to the public to pass judgment on Biden and on all the men who have been similarly accused That is not  media outrage  it s the democratic scrutiny of candidates that our politics is built on and it s  justified 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Blasey Ford didn t change her story  Except for when she moved the timetable of events several years  People who experience trauma may not want to speak about it or even remember it as accurately as they d like especially decades out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox News TV  is a cancer to society That said their actual journalists and polls are not bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,And still beating Bernie by over  in polls   
PoliticalDiscussion,Every current poll  including Fox News  shows both Bernie and Biden with a  point lead over Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t name every Federal Judge Federal Judges also do not make the news like some Appeals and all Scotus judges do 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve never associated neo conservatives with neo Nazis and it would never occur to me to do so just because they share the same prefix 
PoliticalDiscussion,He is way better than the other old white guy who Biden crushed in just a few short days Ya know who that guy is right The guy who called the black voters  the establishment because they picked their guy Biden and then that guy found out that all that diverse coalition he promised wasn t voting for him even after five years of a campaign Biden won almost all the states after that Tuesday Sucks for Sanders that his people only exist on social media but like I said before about Sanders never trust a  year old man promising a revolution he didn t start at  Thats all you need to know about Sanders Mayor Pete ran for POTUS at  He will get more shit done by the time he is  than Sanders ever had 
PoliticalDiscussion,She had multiple chances when Biden was the VP for Obama
PoliticalDiscussion,So if I vote for Sanders in the primary I m a Russian asset 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you know why they haven t heard of him Because he wants to get money out of politics and the news media either bashes him or doesn t talk about him  All of these mainstream media that citizens digest frequently heavily influence their choice in candidates so of course the media wouldn t them picking the  right candidate that would attack their corruption and lobbying power 
PoliticalDiscussion,It had no credible sources   It boiled down to he said she said from  years ago  And if poll numbers are any indication the public decided that Bernie was the truthful one in that matter because he s been consistently doing and saying the same things for over  years or as Warren has changed her tune multiple times 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This isn t a logical solution to the  someone other than Biden issue  Yes but it s the only solution short of biden announcing his running mate   gt Sanders is older and had a heart attack this year He is a HIGHER risk than Biden right now   Yes he is but there are no other options The likelihood that both of them get it and die is incredibly low The likelihood that  of them well get it is not 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s entirely possible that she had multiple encounters with Biden
PoliticalDiscussion,Issue is there are zero Warren progressives not already supporting Biden  He picks up nothing by courting her  I also think that it s been incredibly common to hear the argument that the Sanders wing just can t be won  But I ve yet to genuinely see any effort at making it happen  Every time someone gives me an example it s some backhanded knife we re expected not to notice like eliminating superdelegates  in the first round of voting  or  pulling to the left by supporting free college tuition but in a way that would sideline the existing education reform bill Sanders and Jayapal have put forth in favor of a new piece of legislation which we don t know  likely won t address college debt nor tuition costs charged to the government through the program  Every time you guys claim you re coming to the middle to meet us you re just pissing on our heads and expecting we won t notice  It s so so ridiculously easy to win the Sanders crowd and that s the scary part  Every Sanders supporter can tell you things that Biden or any other candidate could do to get the Sanders wing on their side  It takes almost no political capital and arguably would be nothing but beneficial  Obvious things like  Promise to close Guantanamo   Promise to veto the Patriot Act Renewal   Promise to  legalize cannabis at the federal level by executive order and expunge all federal level cannabis convictions   Some harder ones speak out against EARN IT  Promise to make the unredacted Mueller report public   Promise to reserve a specific percentage of the discretionary budget for green energy production   Such  Simple  Promises  But we can t get you guys to even consider that we aren t in fact motivated by some cult of personality and that we would in fact respond to actual platform changes  Nobody s giving up  I just think that either  A The voter apathy which lost us  did indeed come from the Sanders supporters and not just people in general and the pattern will repeat this year  This is not my thinking but generally the ideology posited to me by the center left who have laid their defeat in  at our doorstep  By their logic they ve aligned themselves to repeat  and are once again banking on a rejection of Trump strong enough to overcome their candidate s trajectory  B The voter apathy we saw in  was generalized and not concentrated among the Sanders crowd  In this case what cost us  was the choices of the Clinton campaign and the DNC leading up to the election  This is what I believe  Fortunately by this logic anybody who actually puts decent effort into a campaign and doesn t spend their time covering themselves in terrible optics just to win a slam dunk primary and then doesn t spend their campaign time pretending they ve already won should beat Trump  From this perspective Biden seems pretty strong as he s  until recently managed to avoid any seriously bad press  But yeah y all could get our hardcore wing on board you just can t convince your own leaders to do the things we all on the ground level agree on which would bring them into the fold  Sure there s a tiny contingent who would never go for anyone but Sanders but they re exceedingly small and the majority of folks not swinging hard toward Biden aren t doing so because of policy not feelings 
PoliticalDiscussion,She was originally a Warren supporter
PoliticalDiscussion, The Media is bought by Biden etc etc  Bernie Subs are no different than TD
PoliticalDiscussion,I d argue that prior campaigns have little barring on current campaigns because everything changes so much in between them Every election cycle is a unique set of circumstances  If we were to use past campaigns as a metric of time then Biden has been campaigning for  years since he first ran for president in  And who knows how much money he s raised to campaign in  years but it would dwarf Bernie possibly by an order of magnitude 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to a  google search   there really isn t any such thing other than maybe Antifa  The term seems to have been  invented by the alt right   as misdirection   I don t consider anything alt left because outside of a concept or perhaps Antifa it just doesn t exist Certainly Antifa doesn t have any clout in government as does the alt right As such it doesn t bear giving any serious thought to let alone worry 
PoliticalDiscussion,How much do you get paid to troll 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t know that we can interpret anything from her social media  We have a she said he said case All we can go on is what she has said at various points in time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders is older and had a heart attack this year He is a HIGHER risk than Biden right now This isn t a logical solution to the  someone other than Biden issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,A story that was backed up by other sources 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tell me what guaranteed universal care means for insurance companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden is considered better  Don t kid yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And that before  her social media seemed to indicate that she was something of a fan of Biden  Not exactly unusual for people victimized by high profile people to publicly express positive opinions of their assaulters 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure where you heard that I have heard people lying about that though The person that broke her story corroborated the digital penetration   
PoliticalDiscussion,A problem is though was the accusation something TimesUp felt was not a case of  Fake Roy Moore Accuser  There was a Roy Moore Accuser that was falsely accusing Roy Moore in order to discredit the other accusers
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie never said that a woman couldn t win It s widely known that was a invented story by Warren to try and boost her numbers and it backfired on her 
PoliticalDiscussion,First off it depends on where you live The Times is the original It was started in  and became part of News Corp  years ago Americans tend to think of the New York Times which was founded in  got its name from The Times The Times of India was started in  and is the most widely read English language newspaper in the world so most people think of that one   But in any case the comment said even the  international media was criticizing Biden and directly linked The Times So it was pretty clear which newspaper we were talking about Unfortunately the user deleted their comment so it s not clear to people who read the comments afterwards 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not all businesses run on slim margins  Facebook s net income was  of revenue  Supply and demand has not kept healthcare costs down   Companies charge the most the market will bear Competition can drive prices down but collusion happens as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,As far I ve seen they corroborated the part about him putting his hand on her back not the rape part Weird how the far more serious allegation isn t the one brought up first Also odd how this hasn t come up before when he ran for President or during the  years he served as VP  And not what I said Liking Putin leads to credibility issues though 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If Trump or Biden had shut down the country in January people would have thought they were dictators  Or February for that matter Remember all the criticism of the travel ban for people coming from China That was Jan  
PoliticalDiscussion,Except Bernie s plan does not remove profit MA would keep providers private just  insurance would be nationalised  If anything this would create an incentive to increase hospital profits
PoliticalDiscussion,Just streamline the barriers to practice in the US and institute a new medical visa with a quick route to a green card  say  years  From a global perspective the pay will still be very good in the US   There will be no shortage of doctors willing to work in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is this page a slide show My adblocker must have filtered out signature legislation by Sanders ya know a progressive bill that he pushed through that proves he can it done Vermont isn t New York It s not Florida Texas California it s a beautiful state but it s easy to hide out there and hardly heard from until he ran for POTUS which for certain you if not living in Vermont never heard of Sanders before and never voted for him Pelosi as Speaker of the House has more power than he does and Schumer pretty much sandboxed Sanders from other Dems running for that seat and Vermont had single payer health coverage but they ditched it after four or five years   Not all senators are Ted Cruz but Sanders isn t Dianne Fienstien or even Barbra Boxer who have done more for Liberal and  progressive issues than Sanders has   Try to do better because everyone else does 
PoliticalDiscussion,When you say The Times people think NYT 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re just a busy bee all over this thread so here s a summary for you so you don t have to keep harassing everyone She is making an unsubstantiated and specious claim against the Democratic party candidate s presumptive nominee while speaking glowingly of the president of Russia who is well known to be a big fan of a Trump presidency That is at  best highly suspicious If you d like to refute any of that feel free 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the only realistic hope for Dems to retain AL was if Roy Moore somehow won the primary now that that didn t happen   I don t see Jones winning even if Sessions were the nominee Sessions may not be liked much by Trump but he s not hated in Alabama and he s not even close to being as divisive a figure as Moore was he ll win easily if he wins the primary runoff 
PoliticalDiscussion,Being known to the public at large is literally the definition of national prominence 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt    This is an op ed from the most conservative editorial board in the country It s an opinion piece not investigative journalism It s still surprising to me how frequently conservatives cite opinion pieces to buttress their claims while also shouting  facts not feelings  Op ed pieces being used to prove a point are the literal antithesis of that sentiment 
PoliticalDiscussion,She s an accuser not a victim 
PoliticalDiscussion,She also said she filed a complaint at the time I d like to see that document frankly given her shifting story 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not necessarily biden is high risk when it comes to corona virus Bernie needs to stay in case the worst happens as nominating anyone other than biden or sanders is giving the presidency to trump As a result until this crisis ends bernie could still be the nominee  Just to be clear I support biden and dont want him to get it I m simply stating that it is a possible situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a really great article that completely changed my perspective on what occurred I highly recommend reading it to anyone who has  minutes to spare  it s long 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden s rout of Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,The responsible thing right now would be to wait for journalists to conduct their own due diligence of her story and determine whether her claims are worth reporting  It seems a lot of them already have or are at least well underway with that process  But that s  really not what some Sanders supporters seem to want at all  There is outright glee about  Biden and  rape being plastered all over the news and social media because they know the words  alleged and  thus far unsubstantiated will be drowned out in the outrage  Even if a month from now Reade came out and said her accusation was made up from the beginning such a media frenzy would have done its damage 
PoliticalDiscussion,And Bernie has heart problems    and that s me trying to avoid the elephant in the room
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I wonder how much they actually care about the person accusing Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not just money campaign operations too He mounted a pretty impressive amount of staff and field offices out of basically nothing and his staff have contracts until November   Between grandstanding and more campaign resources resources help more Going high all the time is a losing strategy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joe already held essentially more centrist versions of all bernies policies People are just realising that now 
PoliticalDiscussion,The people who are complaining are the same people calling Biden Supporters  Blue MAGAs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has fuck all money Hell get far more adds once Bloombergs funds are fully available 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m aware of the term neo Nazi but I didn t make any association between neo Nazi and neoconservative  maybe it s the dash in the former or    idk  Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s largely because outside of New York and California most places haven t been hit yet You know all the places where Trump is already popular    Our best hope for getting through this and unfortunately Trump s best chances of reelection are if experts are wrong and this thing dies out over the summer Trump gets a rebounded economy to run on but more importantly people you and I will never hear about will have time to create more tests and to build ventilators to deal with the next wave A wave that will likely hit is after the election    Democrats are actually helping Trump s reelection by not letting everything fall apart It s the downside of having empathy for people you ve never met it makes it harder to win elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s good because he can use it to attack trump on covid  when the election campaigning really begins By using this as an example of how things wouldn t of being as bad were he in charge 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean most voters still aren t paying attention to the election Only in the U S do we stretch these things out for  years We really need to get back to concentrated campaigning in the  months before the election We also need campaign finance reform so our Congress people aren t spending half their time in office fundraising or campaigning It s gotten way out of hand   
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden has always been extremely soft on Russia He was Obama s VP afterall Where s your fantasy that he will get tough on Russia coming from 
PoliticalDiscussion,In fairness it probably  should suck the air out of everything else The pandemic is an objectively much bigger deal right now
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders won young black voters by a far smaller margin than whites and was absolutely thrashed among older black voters He did worse among african americans than whites in every possible way  Just blaming it on boomers is therefore not enough If the explanation is cable news or corrupt endorsements then you ve got to explain why you think black voters are more susceptible to being influenced than white voters I think it s hard to do that without using racial tropes  As an aside Bernie supporters keep calling Biden a  segregationist  but it s a line that just does not ring true He once voted against bussing a position which was backed by plenty of African Americans at the time That doesn t make him a segregationist by any stretch This kind of hyperbole helps no one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Seriously Kavanaugh went from  lt  name recognition to easily  name recognition the day he was nominated  For someone who is trying to forget the very existence of their attacker Kavanaugh going from largely irrelevant to someone that would be on the national news at least once every few months is a huge deal 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you have some sort of evidence that the rest of us dont you should come forward with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a terrible thing to wish for but I have really been hoping they both get it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The second one you labeled as  as well for some reason College grants based on race It s legal and good as long as you are the correct race 
PoliticalDiscussion,Political correctness exists as much on the right as much as the left mate  In group philosophy and corrective culture isn t something only the left does I mean the fact that right wingers genuinely make it a point that they ought refer to covid as the Wuhan virus is in and of itself   gt correcting something in the political sphere
PoliticalDiscussion,You clearly want to ignore the influence of Russia because it makes your preferred candidate look bad 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden has been in the public sphere for decades He was Obama s VP  gt   gt So only running for President qualifies for enough outrage  Again maybe you should actually listen to the interview with the assault victim because this is answered in that   She had a young daughter and waited until she was grown until coming forward with the allegation   Try actually listening to women and maybe you will find answers to these questions    gt but I m allowed to question the story  You haven t even listened to her story If you had you would have known the answer to the above question    gt The vast majority of people pushing this story on Reddit and the internet aren t doing it because they feel sympathy or anger they re doing it because they want to take down Biden  Not everyone is as morally bankrupt as you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but do you really think a liberal left wing news org is going to report on this 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s incredibly foolish is what you just said because it s not even remotely close to any part of my comment
PoliticalDiscussion,People would greatly care about the story but the mainstream media hasn t reported on it One interpretation is that there is a grand conspiracy to hurt self described anti establishment candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump The other is that the story doesn t meet the minimal journalistic standards for a newspaper to report on it      
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Then Biden became the frontrunner and she had no other option but to go to the media  Biden has been in the public sphere for decades He was Obama s VP  So only running for President qualifies for enough outrage   I m not going to attack Ms Reade but I m allowed to question the story as is everyone else And maybe that s why so many people turned her away   The vast majority of people pushing this story on Reddit and the internet aren t doing it because they feel sympathy or anger they re doing it because they want to take down Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Wait   So you re saying because every Klansman neo Nazi etc   in America didn t show up then the rally was not organized by them That makes not a lick of sense    nbsp Wait    so you re inferring that the meaning of  very very POORLY attended in comparison to their total membership  is  every Klansman neo Nazi etc   in America didn t show up     I hope that you don t quite your day job to become a logician or more to the point a philologist  
PoliticalDiscussion,So ignore Russia s meddling Who ignores an enemy That is incredibly foolish 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt politics is much easier to bear when you remove personal feelings from it  No idea why you re getting salty with me If you don t like my interpretation of these events down vote and move along  There are plenty of subs that will echo the exact sentiment you want to feel towards Biden and Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt All that being said it seems odd that her story changed from touchy to full on sexual assault I think that s where a lot of people are attacking her credibility  It s not odd   All the questions about credibility like  her story changed or  why now are answered if you actually listen to the full interview with Katie Halper   The original claim was just to support Lucy Flores who was alleging that Biden touched and kissed her At the time Reade admits she was afraid and didn t want media spotlight but wanted to support Flores and her story   She originally talked about the sex assault a full year ago in Spring of  but then she got doxxed harassed and started receiving death threats from Biden supporters This caused her to retreat and go to Time s Up  Time s Up referred her to multiple lawyers saying they couldn t take the case due to a conflict of interest Many of the other lawyers she went to said the same and had conflicts of interest with the Biden campaign   She finally found one law agency that was willing to take the case but only after the Virginia primary as they also had a conflict of interest and thought Biden would drop out by Virginia and they had planned to pursue the case then   Then Biden became the frontrunner and she had no other option but to go to the media   Honestly the people questioning her credibility without even listening to the full interview and hearing her side are disgusting   Everyone should listen to the interview themselves then tell me you don t believe her    
PoliticalDiscussion,You people really need to start taking responsibility for your own shortcomings in the political sphere instead of bludgeoning everyone with Russia 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like I said you guys keep losing and losing and you refuse to understand why 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s in working class people s best interests for their country to have as much power on the world stage as possible Look at the lives of working class people in countries that have lost global power It s not like that triggers a socialist revolution or something Call it propaganda but Putin absolutely wants to take the US s place as global leader and people like Trump or Bernie would help him a lot 
PoliticalDiscussion,You want Biden to win and I m telling you that your line on these allegations is a loser If you don t care to talk about that aspect of politics then move on 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has sidestepped in his responses to other women and blamed them for not saying  this makes me uncomfortable   He has publicly ridiculed the prior women who said he inappropriately touched them    He says he wants to change sexual assault culture but he seems to not understand consent if he thinks his hands should be anywhere near a woman s body  More than one woman has said this about him  His responses to any of the prior women have been rude dismissive and victim blaming    It is not a woman s job to remind men not to touch them at work  Ask if you aren t sure 
PoliticalDiscussion,Referencing someone as a white make to disparage participation in some immediate discourse is not necessarily advocating for minority groups to have intrinsically more rights than a group with a plurality 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not here to convince anyone to vote for Biden I m here to talk about politics   I couldn t care less who you vote for 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obviously 
PoliticalDiscussion,I said  credible  This woman had already accused Biden of harassment and hinted that there was more to the story She did actually work for Biden at the time of the alleged assault putting them at the same place at the same time And she has people who back her up and say she told them about it at the time You might recognize those as the only things supporting Christine Blasey Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh which Democrats universally received as truthful 
PoliticalDiscussion,People are always going to spin conspiracies and the narrative should be about whether this is true because it is a serious charge  No one should call someone else a liar simply because the abuse is old  Men in both parties got away with a lot of crap  Younger voters have a right to hear both sides and decide if the guy seems worthy of office  There is a ton of video footage of Biden going on about how he thought it was okay to touch women unless they told him it made them uncomfortable  He said that just last year  If his response to Reade is anything close to this voters are entitled to say  not good enough in    The real failing here is the DNC for failing to allow voters to vet this issue in January 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay dude I don t think you re convincing anyone who wasn t already on the Biden train because your kneejerk circling of the wagons around him is literally exactly the same reaction Republicans had to Kavanaugh and anyone can see that it s a double standard 
PoliticalDiscussion,This fantasy you re trying to paint about a president being tough on Russia does not reflect reality It s basically neo McCarthyist propaganda at this point Working class people can t vote in their own self interest cuz Russia It s a complete boogeyman  Also the Russians have had their preference on US presidents since the beginning of time In fact most countries do The US actually has their preferences on who should lead other countries as well I hear they ve sponsored a few coups throughout the years and even have a budget for propaganda 
PoliticalDiscussion,We can t We are completely fucked economically Millions of laid off workers who are reducing consumption because they no longer have income Everyone else reducing  consumption because of economic uncertainty  Employers getting ready to lay off employees to cut costs during an economic downturn The only question is how fucked we are going to be and how we will deal with the resulting poverty 
PoliticalDiscussion,People have to care about this story for it to be a threat and nobody outside the DSA cares about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neo con refers to conservatives that have pivoted their policy platform to the left to maintain power as a domestic hegemon It d be like the difference between a republican that is in favor of the ACA and one that isn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have fun further realizing your own government doesn t care or give a rats ass about you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see your point   I only clarified that Warren was lying about Bernie and it was obvious to everyone It was even more amazing to see how CNN ran with it It was comical at how bad it was and the whole thing blew up in her face 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what the Bernie people want but as soon as one of their guys go down their views will have  evolved    I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if Bernie was ahead by  delegates and leading in the polls by double digits and an accusation came out against him these same Bernie Bro s and their mouthpieces like Kyle Kulinski and Jimmy Dore would be shouting from the rooftops that this is an example of the establishment and the  corporate democrats rigging the election 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Again there are people dying in countries who have a national health care plan  And you don t see how the U S healthcare system with its  inefficiency and lack of preparedness in general will see even worse casualties than countries with nationalized healthcare plans pretty soon or how people who just lost their jobs might have trouble getting the help they need because their healthcare was tied to their employer  Or how people seeing the cost of treatment might opt to tough it out when we see a second wave in the fall and winter  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re certainly doing something that would help Russia Russia has been backing both Trump and Bernie Either of them as president would be a boon for Putin 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is why you guys keep losing She was the closest ally you had in the primary and you couldn t even get her onboard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also there s nothing that the democrats can do realistically Northam can t get booted for scandal so if he decides he wants to potentially burn his career and stay in office that s kinda how it has to be He really doesn t have anything to lose 
PoliticalDiscussion, alt left  is the continued insistence that because there is a self branded alt right there must be an equal and analogous faction on the left I don t think it s meaningful or useful and was only ever crafted and intended to say  the left is just as bad it s not a real collective self identified and purposeful movement the way alt right is and has only been a way to label members of the left under a generic and vague category That s been done for the right too but using an existing movement 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think democrats have already learned from that This is why Kirsten Gillibrand s Presidential campaign was an embarrassment and she did about as well as Marianne Williamson 
PoliticalDiscussion, Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable   You will wake up soon enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it means new Neocons vs paleoconservatives for example 
PoliticalDiscussion, Apes don t read philosophy    Yes they do Otto they just don t understand it   Have fun being an ape 
PoliticalDiscussion,But then the argument would be  TimesUp is working with the Biden Campaign because they contacted the Bernie campaign which is a narrative that is being pushed on some Bernie subs
PoliticalDiscussion,She is now claiming that she filed a complaint  previously no harassment had occurred now it s rape before she was fired  previously she resigned   Both the nature of her departure and the existence of that complaint can be evaluated 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Agreed We need to assume what she is saying is true until we actually look into it and hear from Biden  We need to assume that it  might be true not that it  is true We also need to assume that the statement from the Biden campaign  might be true    gt calling the victim a liar because of something else she said on social media that has nothing to do with the original incident  We re trying to evaluate her credibility  we don t very much in public from her right now and the only thing we have any meaningful quantity of is her social media postings  and a number of public records  Those things do not paint a flattering picture of her credibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps Times Up looked into it  But if they did then I think the first thing they should have done was contacted the Biden campaign to ask them for a statement  Their response was  paraphrasing  we re not touching that with a  foot pole   No one wants a repeat of  where Democrats ignored the cries of women against Bill Clinton but it seems to be where we re headed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed  We need to assume what she is saying is true until we actually look into it and hear from Biden  I m not sure what specifically he would say is supposedly true or supposedly false but I do think he owes the public a better explanation than that  Does he deny touching her at all  I want to know exactly how far apart these stories are  I don t want everyone to just expect that  vote blue no matter who is a good enough explanation  Americans deserve to know exactly what his version of the truth is here before we start calling the victim a liar because of something else she said on social media that has nothing to do with the original incident 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ask him about God s plan If a baby gets aborted then that is God s plan So quit getting in the way of god 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh I guess some people just do not watch things around them You are welcome to go to youtube or some other such site There are videos used all over where people shout at people expressing their opinion  You are all white males  as though that invalidates it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is no group that is pushing for more favorable rules for minorities than the Majority  Correct   gt There is no group that claims that it s impossible to be racist against white people  Yep   gt There is no group that tells people their views are invalid because they are the majority  Three in a row You re doing great   gt There is no group that marches and riots when a member of the minority dies but counter protests when a member of the majority dies and gets the same response  Damn four straight you re killing it baby   gt We have them in congress Even with this new stimulus bill if you are a minority run business the money is a grant if you are white the money is a loan We have them pushing for laws that higher people more favorably if they are darker skinned rather than the merit of their skills Government hiring systems make it so that you get just as many points for having been born a minority as you do for having served in a combat zone  Alright well here s the part where you dun goofed Can t win em all I guess
PoliticalDiscussion,Idk but I hate living in  Why promote censorship 
PoliticalDiscussion,The point is though that I think if what Gillibrand did in taking down Franken was super popular she would have been one of  candidates that were campaigning in Iowa This story is less credible than the Franken story and is getting far less media attention and is being pushed a lot harder by the Bernie Sanders movement than the right so I think this is going to nowhere except maybe get talked about more on the Majority Report or Jimmy Dore s show 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the House  Republicans voted no versus every single Democrat voting yes Sounds like Republicans care a lot less about helping people here 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean just today he said New York doesn t need a quarantine and just last week said states that don t like him don t deserve help and that we don t more ventilators He hasn t been taking it seriously but now less than  of Americans disapprove of him 
PoliticalDiscussion,You still don t want to campaign against someone who has been campaigning for a full year just  months before the election  Thats our system maybe other countries do it better but if you want to win you have to deal with the system you re in 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can do this all day  
PoliticalDiscussion,And your point it is what exactly  I ve clarified that Biden disappeared after the last primary the meme came then And that comparing campaign lengths of time is a faulty metric by which to base anything  Additionally I ve pointed out that Biden s lead over Trump has been shrinking and in no small part that has to do with him completely disappearing from the media cycle 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt After Kavanaugh Democrats are not going to be able to hush this up by painting Biden as the lesser of two evils  And this is the very point I m trying to make these situations shouldn t be compared and the fact that we are comparing them shows how toxic and political this issue can be  MeToo has done great things but trial by media is not one of them    gt Last I checked there was one candidate still running for president who hasn t been accused of rape or caught on camera creeping on young women and girls  And if he were accused can you promise yourself you would judge him the same way you are judging Biden And to this point can you bring yourself to criticize Bernie at all  I m going to be honest and you can dismiss me if you d like politics is much easier to bear when you remove personal feelings from it   Biden wasn t even in my top three My  choice blew a great opportunity It sucks I was disappointed but I hold him accountable   Not other voters Not the media Not the establishment   And then I move on I try to look at candidates and politicians in the coldest way possible I like to think it keeps me level headed   But I know I have my biases as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s nearly nothing they could find to confirm it s true it was almost  decades ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no group that is pushing for more favorable rules for minorities than the Majority  There is no group that claims that it s impossible to be racist against white people  There is no group that tells people their views are invalid because they are the majority  There is no group that marches and riots when a member of the minority dies but counter protests when a member of the majority dies and gets the same response  We have them in congress Even with this new stimulus bill if you are a minority run business the money is a grant if you are white the money is a loan We have them pushing for laws that higher people more favorably if they are darker skinned rather than the merit of their skills Government hiring systems make it so that you get just as many points for having been born a minority as you do for having served in a combat zone  All of the above is not really something to throw a big fit over but it is proof that there are people leaning that way Those are not equality laws those are supremacy laws Equality laws would be a redirection of money to impoverished communities and neighborhoods while keeping hiring the same The increase in education quality would lead to a balancing out Because believe it or not being a minority does not make them less capable than someone who is white If they are given equal opportunities from the start like non poor neighborhoods and schools they can do anything that a white person can and that level of skill will get them hired 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah they are  US citizens voting not native Italians Irish African etc ya dumbass  Is Sanders behind Brexit Do you speak English   Jeebus you re making a real bad case for Bernie Bros You re worse that those cretins over at T D   Just flat out moron 
PoliticalDiscussion,The story deserves zero oxygen and has more holes in it than a Steve Allen murder mystery Biden is doing the right thing to by ignoring Actually they aren t ignoring it the campaign put out a statement calling the allegations false   Your Bernie bias is aleady showing with the word  centrist  A centrist is somebody that s between republican and democrat Somebody that voted for Bush in  Obama in  Romney in  and Clinton in  is a centrist Far left DSA members consider anybody that s to the right of Bernies platform a  centrist or  moderate  
PoliticalDiscussion,I never said he didn t 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t really seen any major news outlet report it it s all small stuff and shit eating propaganda sites like the intercept 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There can be no investigation It s a cold case sexual assault allegation There is no physical evidence There is nothing but the word of the accuser and the accused How do people not get this by now  There have been very thorough investigations of Roy Moore Brett Kavanaugh and Harvey Weinstein despite all of these allegations being  cold cases  There is a lot more to an investigation than physical evidence Start by interviewing people the accuser knows to see if they can corroborate the story Interview the accuser Did the accuser ever file an official piece of documentation at the time of the assault If so look at that Has the accuser talked to a therapist about this in the past If so interview the therapist Has the accuser s story changed Are they being consistent There is a world of difference between an accusation that has been thoroughly vetted and one that hasn t   gt If you are credibly accused of sexual assault you should not hold federal office It s not that you are automatically guilty just because you are accused It s that we can easily find someone better without the stain of a credible accusation  If we go down the path you re suggesting then anyone with any sort of accusation no matter how flimsy is going to be removed from office How exactly won t this be weaponized 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes an accusation credible is the word of the victim the victim and the accused credibly being in the same place at the time of the alleged assault and people who witnessed or heard of the assault from the victim at the time among other things Those were the only things supporting Ford s allegations and Democrats wholeheartedly claimed to believe them Categorically ignoring allegations that meet the same standard just because Biden is the one under scrutiny is a completely unsustainable about face that is guaranteed to fail Whether or not you think the allegations are credible you should hope that Democrats are seen as taking them seriously because such blatant hypocrisy will never win an election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed I mostly added the comment to warn people it was long so they knew what they were getting in to  I remember when I read it  months ago I ended up glued to my phone as I read through it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the Democratic primary is not over yet Last I checked there was one candidate still running for president who hasn t been accused of rape or caught on camera creeping on young women and girls Sadly only one but it s better than nothing
PoliticalDiscussion,But from that survey which is designed to catch occasional voters and Obama trump swing state ones specifically he hasn t really won back any of them or way less than enough to win convincingly in upper mid west swing states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah the only way Biden possibly wins here is by confronting it head on and killing it via it being false If there s truth to it he s finished but if he sidesteps it  which so far he has not then it makes it easy to paint it as true by the opposition 
PoliticalDiscussion,No
PoliticalDiscussion,Politic correctness is whatever you want it to be and exists on all sides
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no group like that
PoliticalDiscussion,Best thing Biden could do is focus on all the  profit the Trump family and friends are getting   while  giving bad advice to the American people   Those types of ads would really undermine any message  fake or otherwise that Trump might have Biden should effectively become the inspector general of Trump family   friends since  Trump is unwilling to provide Congressional oversight over the stimulus package   effectively creating a GOP slush fund 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Americans deserve politicians with absolutely spotless records of personal conduct  Lol good luck finding that   The standard you re setting is ridiculous We have a president who admitted in court to defrauding a veteran fundraiser and you think if anyone s innocence is in doubt they shouldn t hold office The Republican Party and their voters laugh at you     gt I personally believe that someone who is credibly accused of sexual assault should not hold elected office  What defines credibly accused It seems that Reddit defines it as  The candidate I don t like is being accused therefor he is guilty  In this case Ms Reade s story changed and her case was rebuffed by several groups who heard it  for a reason     I m not telling you to compromise If you want to be a purist that s your business 
PoliticalDiscussion,But what makes an accusation credible That s the entire issue in this discussion If ANY accusation is disqualifying then an accusation can be used easily as a weapon to eliminate any politicians from holding office The public has to determine whether the accusation is disqualifying and that s tricky to do This is why it s hard to bring down politicians with allegations from the past that are difficult to verify 
PoliticalDiscussion,And then forgot about the one where she was sexually harassed 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is his record mind you he has worked with republicans  
PoliticalDiscussion,After seeing Cuomo a lot over the past few weeks I wonder if people aren t getting buyer s remorse that he s not the nominee 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not going to get into whether or not his campaign  should be affected by these allegations  But how  will it be affected Probably not at all because he s going up against Donald Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly you are overstating how much the American public cares about sexual assault and victims of it especially when the  alleged perpetrator is a wealthy  High Profile white male Sadly enough the only times where sexual crimes become relevant are whenever other individuals can utilize these victims accusers for their own convenience If not then nothing can come from it Case in point Jeffery fucking Epstein 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not about innocence or guilt We are not deciding whether or not someone goes to prison we are deciding whether or not to confer absolute power on them The standard of evidence required for conviction has absolutely nothing to do with this I personally believe that someone who is credibly accused of sexual assault should not hold elected office It s not because I believe all people who are accused are guilty It s that even the appearance of guilt is a dark enough stain on someone s image to disqualify them Americans deserve politicians with absolutely spotless records of personal conduct That doesn t mean innocent until proven guilty that means that if their innocence is in doubt they should stay a civilian 
PoliticalDiscussion,I place my bets on the guy who didn t have a heart attack this year and doesn t have to go to the Senate around people who aren t taking this seriously being the one to  survive this 
PoliticalDiscussion,What a surprise A Bernie voter I think it s shocking how all of you are so desperately rooting for this to be true As of right now it s a claim that no legitimate news organization is willing to pick up Biden s campaign has already said they absolutely want it investigated Why are you so sure this is absolutely true when everything points the other direction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those are literally Americans that are living outside of the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,You keep saying  trillion but it isn t its less than that And biden only won because he needed two the support of two candidates and a popular texas candidate to win He didn t do it on his own accord and following People got this grand idea that he was more  electable which clearly is not the case when he has already gotten ramrodded verbally by trump   And come November biden and the Democratic establishment will only face the same result they did four years ago by placing all of their of eggs in one corrupt creepy and nonsensical basket 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re   just  wrong in the head   Do yourself a favor and don t try this politics thing Because you flat out don t understand the links you are posting lol 
PoliticalDiscussion,No meta discussion All comments containing meta discussion will be removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that would have been optimal but a lot of Sanders supporters have been slow to grapple with the possibility he could lose That could also impacted when she actually started shopping the story around 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re just a pseudo woke phony  lol you keep using these catch all liberal terms to describe me I love it I want to show this to all the other Sanders supporters who call me the opposite 
PoliticalDiscussion,In April 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s definitely some space between those two poles
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure the vetting point is relevant She claims that she only told her immediate family Not sure how the Obama campaign could possibly have known about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alt right people tend to be conservative on culture war issues and immigration race issues but all over the board  ranging from socialism to libertarianism  on economics issues  So perhaps if there is an alt left it would be made up of people who are leftist primarily when it comes to culture war issues and immigration race issues but are all over the place on economics issues  Indeed such people exist   In this comment I am using terms like  left   right  and  alt right somewhat loosely I know that  left and  right are not well defined and that the label  alt right is rejected by many people that it is applied to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Roy Moore Accused of being a child molester  Brett Kavanaugh Accused of being a date rapist  Al Franken Accused of kissing someone for longer than he maybe should have in a skit where he was supposed to kiss someone Also pretending  not actually but pretending to cup a woman s breasts   One of these is not like the other 
PoliticalDiscussion,Roy Moore Accused of being a child molester  Brett Kavanaugh Accused of being a date rapist  Al Franken Accused of kissing someone for longer than he maybe should have in a skit where he was supposed to kiss someone Also pretending  not actually but pretending to cup a woman s breasts   One of these is not like the other 
PoliticalDiscussion,most of the media will essentially give Biden a pass   Believe Women        exceptions apply
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not convinced that there really that many self branded white supremacists and Nazis in the US At the least I would imagine that there are at least as many people who consciously want to take away the property of landlords and rich people and perhaps even to do violence against them as there are people who are consciously white supremacists and or Nazis 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh i see Yeah tbh the best recourse imo is offering loans that track inflation and giving additional direct stimulus akin to the UBI bit 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree The true colors of Bernie supporters willing to devalue victims by trying to prop up an obvious fraud look pretty bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tell me what he has been convicted of since he became president
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but didn t you hear about the infamous April  Chernyshevsky meeting  between  Kuznetsov  Goncharov and  Oblonsky And we all know that when  Chernyshevsky and Goncharov are involved Putin isn t far removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,The term was invented by Richard Spencer and it s used by his followers But its also commonly used to refer to a much broader swath of people I ve heard everyone from Milo Yiannopalous to Joe Rogan described as Alt Right   The vast majority who get that label would view it as an insult and an attempt to associate them with people like Richard Spencer Its very rare to hear someone use the term as a proud label Whenever the term comes up its almost always being used as an insult 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly it s really mask off for democrats now All that whining and crying about how unfair the GOP was being in smearing her is now apparent for what it was most of them  political maneuvering Believe women when it benefits your politics ignore them otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,My man stop pretending you care about making the world a better place when you can t even take an hour of your life to listen to a rape victim 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bank of American has been called out as saying that they will allow people up to  days without making a mortgage payment but will then expect the payment in full for those  days  So if your mortgage payment was  a month then by the end of  months you would owe  for the  months and the current month due 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes of course any criticism of establishment dems are just Russia conspiracy theories Please ignore any dissent it is all fake news Everything is fine 
PoliticalDiscussion,My man smoke a Blunt and go for a walk You re really not advancing your cause  If you really care about making the world a better place it starts with getting to know people who have different views  But if you re just an internet troll then I ve wasted my time 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re missing the point that they   already negotiated the bill    It wasn t Republicans just putting random crap in it  They literally skipped their vacation to negotiate then obstructed it  three times  And still ended up passing the same bill  What was the point of that  NOTHING 
PoliticalDiscussion,How dare Democrats try to make a good bill instead of a mediocre one I guess
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah no  You have to skip over the  two times Democrats obstructed even voting on the thing in the senate and the fact that it was passed unanimously  in the senate to get to this point  That s before we consider the rd obstruction in the House preventing the vote  Mind you those obstructions were after negotiating the bill  So at no point was it ever a partisan bill    It was always bipartisan  So those dissenting  Republicans didn t do anything when you realize we could ve had this passed in both houses on  Monday or  Tuesday at the least without Democrat obstruction 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The vast majority of you sanders supporters call me a conservative and you call me a liberal  You are all liberals to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,It became pejorative because it s a term associated with white supremacist groups but it was still coined by noted racist Richard Spencer as a more palatable term for the sort of highly reactionary racist groups that he is associated with 
PoliticalDiscussion,And that s why the point you re making is stupid You re trying to call me out about liberal hypocrisy regarding the metoo movement and you don t even realize I don t support their tactics at all  You re barking liberal hypocrisy at the wrong person My goodness my dude  The vast majority of you sanders supporters call me a conservative and you call me a liberal  Get to know someone before you make assumptions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s assume everything Biden s been accused of is true Trump s  indescretions are worse Full stop  If our only real choices end up being Trump or Biden there s no contest I ll vote for Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  true colors in this case being just how willing the dirtbag left is willing to chase a transparent lie in order to elect Trump out of their hate for the mainstream Democratic party 
PoliticalDiscussion,qq moar
PoliticalDiscussion,An allegation from a woman with zero credibility being tossed around all over reddit by desperate Bernie supporters and in the right wing media by desperate Trump supporters will have no affect    This woman came out and made an allegation against Biden a year ago  Oh but wait before making that allegation she scrubbed her internet history to remove her writing praise for Putin and Russia and taking shots at Democrats and Mueller  When she was done attempting to cover her tracks she makes an allegation that Biden placed a hand on her thigh and ran a finger down her neck  Unfortunately for her the internet never forgets and she was quickly dismissed as having zero credibility once her past writings were discovered    So cut to a year later and she s back this time with a new and improved story that is much more graphic and rises to the level of rape  This admitted Bernie supporter appears on a podcast being hosted by a Bernie supporter and tells her new story     Here s some good reading with citations that show just how bogus this entire thing is     
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Supply and demand has not kept healthcare costs down   Like I said pharmaceuticals are an exception because they are monopolized But not healthcare is in itself  like going to visit the doctor or going to the ER has an extremely high operating cost so it will always be seen as  expensive  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Again go read what I said about this situation and you ll know exactly how I feel  I don t care   Your actions now are what I am judging you on and they speak volumes    gt Morals Don t pretend like you care  Deflection I m not the one refusing to even listen to the woman s interview 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The altright picked the label altright  I think very few people embrace that term for themselves It tends to be used as a pejorative 
PoliticalDiscussion,What will the effects be of an unfounded conspiracy being tossed out by a Bernie supporter and amplified by an appearance on a podcast hosted by a Bernie supporter be  Fuck all that s what 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that s true that the fix won t be fast but the reason the economy is going down is because of Covid and most likely it would at least be close maby not to where it was before like I said but not far 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly Probably not affected much at all 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Oh it makes absolute sense that this story is being pushed harder by Bernie Sanders supporters instead of right wing media  I completely forgot that Biden hasn t been attacked at all by Republicans and President Trump during this primary My mistake    gt Of course progressives are definitely going to fight for underdog which in this case is the woman What are you talking about  Underdog What is that even supposed to mean It s being pushed by the same people who said Biden is brain dead missing and Hillary    You re going to tell me they are being honest brokers about this  Say that with a straight face 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Then you accuse others of  not actually caring to deflect from your own lack of care  Again go read what I said about this situation and you ll know exactly how I feel But understanding doesn t go two ways with you I guess   I can tell you this I wouldn t use it to advance my political goals like you and others are   Morals Don t pretend like you care   Case and point I m sure you re horrified about what the Sandanistas and Castro did while in power   I m sure someone as pure a soul as you would never support a politician who sympathized with them 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have heard neoliberal though right 
PoliticalDiscussion, I ve never encountered the term  neo left       that was part of my evidence   for my assertion about the slander behind  neo con  
PoliticalDiscussion,when has Trump ever gotten a single pass  every single accusation against him regardless of how ridiculous it is is treated as a Holy Grail
PoliticalDiscussion, gt such blatant hypocrisy will never win an election  Sorry did you stop following the news in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Leaving an election to chance You think that having a  year old recent cardiac patient who has to travel back and forth to Washington is a valuable  sub for Joe Biden I understand you are disappointed that he s effectively lost this primary but this is pure fantasy If we need someone to replace an elderly candidate we have about  other recent candidates who could easily take his place 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uh I m lookin g at the  day proposal NYC has and the federal government covers payments 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no set standard of behavior for how sexual assault victims act
PoliticalDiscussion,All you re pointing out is that there s hypocrisy occurring  You re not defining  credible into a meaningful thing which is the problem  What should define a credible accusation that leads to someone being no long viable for public office 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh it makes absolute sense that this story is being pushed harder by Bernie Sanders supporters instead of right wing media It would be weird it that is not the case Right wing media has no reason to push this story now when they could push this in the general Meanwhile Bernie Sanders is still in the race Bernie Sanders supporters are progressives Of course progressives are definitely going to fight for underdog which in this case is the woman What are you talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s your problem with The Intercept I don t know a ton about them but a quick Google search tells me that two of their lead editors are Glen Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill Both of them are progressive journalists who have done a lot of good work in the past 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I think we are on the same page to a large extent lol You mention how you dont know how Biden s plan would be successful but we actually dont know about Bernie s MA also Bernie s just  sounds better because supposedly everyone will receive insurance but even his plan would have to be negotiated in congress into at least a  tiered system Outside of incredible taxation  which is the only way a single payer can raise funds compared to a mutli  there isnt much else that we know   As I said though we are on the same relative page but we have  different ways of wanting to approach fixing the broken system 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you brought up neo cons and notably neo left  More accurately what we say in the current climate is neo liberal How does the  neo in neo liberal translate to nazism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Telling a consistent story would have been evidence It s not my fault Reade thoroughly obliterated that possibility 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Perhaps Times Up looked into it   Times Up did look into it That s another important part of the story   She initially sought help from Times Up However Times Up refused to assist her arguing that the political nature of the story could endanger its non profit status Anita Dunn a high profile adviser to the Biden campaign is on the board of Times Up This is being reported on by  The Intercept  
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay so still I need to know what you consider a  right to be in a definitional sense  Are rights intrinsic and only then removed or are rights non existent until actualized via political institutions  Also is what matters universality of the requisite criteria or universality of outcome 
PoliticalDiscussion,It means that    and   what I claim Nice try 
PoliticalDiscussion, What I am trying to say is   gt the U S has substantially higher spending worse population health outcomes and worse access to care than other wealthy countries  gt    Thanks for posting the article with that comment  Tackling all  is important to me   gt A single payer system would kill so many jobs Research administration private sector jobs so what happens to them Do those people not matter as well   All people matter  And all people deserve to have jobs  However I would prefer to rebalance employment to different areas of need and away from health care administration   gt In the end both systems would significant decrease the costs spent on healthcare here in the US and would ensure universal healthcare  I don t understand how the currently proposed plan from Biden would significantly decrease the USA healthcare spend or improve the population health outcomes   gt  single payer countries lack extensive research and innovation funding  Research is important  Something like Nice   does great independent research understanding what the effective and cost effective standards should be  I don t know of a USA equivalent   gt this would also give states some ability to manage health care   I don t think states work unless they can print money  When there is a downturn like is happening now states lose revenue  The currency issuer can print money and borrow risk free states can t  The European post GFC stagnation is partly associated with their lack of their ability to fund the kind of fiscal deficits the USA has had  States can administer spending but they should not have to come up with the funds   For health I would prefer an undemocratic technocracy   bureaucracy at arms length from government 
PoliticalDiscussion,First neo conservative does not relate at all to neo nazi neo Nazi literally just means new Nazi Neo conservative is built around a sort of Reaganite standard They left the peaceful Democrat party to become Republicans who favored social conservative with militant action  They don t relate to each other and use the word neo to denote new in two seperate ways Neo Nazis denote Nazis after  Neo conservative is a rebirth of conservative ways or New conservative form 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very true 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or it could be sexual assault victims are just not super excited to be describing details of their assault An interviewer  is supposed to guide them along 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Bud enough of the personal attacks  Eat shit You don t deserve civility   Liberals are hypocrites and you are proving that Then you accuse others of  not actually caring to deflect from your own lack of care   Your response exemplifies the fake woke language of liberal ideology You people don t actually care about anyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I d rather go to Sweden or Finland Not just for education but quality of life as well Because apparently the bullshit your government has fed you constantly appears to be blowing up in their faces as millions of people realize that profit trumps their own lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you honestly not know why 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bud enough of the personal attacks It s the internet No one cares Anyway I posted my thoughts on the  Metoo movement how this case relates to it and the second and third order effects elsewhere in this thread   You can go read it if you d like   This case as most are far more nuanced than  guilty until proven innocent   Your response exemplifies the backlash to  metoo You don t actually sympathize with her You re using her   One look at your comment history and it s obvious this isn t about empowering women it s about advancing your personal cause   So step down from your pedestal because your righteous indignation isn t winning anyone over   And when you sit there and wonder why Bernie and his movement failed and you wonder why occupy wallstreet failed it ll be right in front of you   Instead of engaging in productive dialogue with your fellow citizens your just judge them from a safe space   The world is shades of gray 
PoliticalDiscussion,You really haven t said anything to be frank   You doubled down on a bunk story   Then pointed at people who called it out and said they failled to get supporters pushing a bunk story to be supporters on thier team   Which is a laughably dumb narrative to try and push People pushing an obviously bunk story were never going to be Bernie supporters and implying otherwise is laughable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Education was declared a right at the same time we instituted public education systems 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are wrong in the context of left wing American politics    That s   what s relevant NOT what s absent from the dictionary or some other keeper of the meanings of such things    It s   the meaning held by the wielders of the slur that matters  and to their victims 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well then you know how senile a person can appear to be which is why you shouldn t put your hope in biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll wait until legitimate news sources do an actual investigation on this matter If it s a worth a story good journalists would do something
PoliticalDiscussion,If you listen to the interview she seemed reluctant to speak The interviewer Katie Halper seemed to be pushing her along Katie is a Bernie or Bust Sanders supporter   Katie has a podcast with Rolling Stone called Useful Idiots She has always disliked Biden But up until recently she dismissed him as irrelevant After Super Tuesday she realized what a threat he was to Bernie It could be the case that this realization led her to search for dirt on Biden especially aggressively   So it might not be the case that the victim decided this was an opportune moment to speak Rather it might be the case that Sanders supporter Katie Halper realized that Sanders needs a Hail Mary in order to win Perhaps she heard whispers of the assault and decided that now was the time to pursue the story 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay
PoliticalDiscussion,I have slept more sense than you make 
PoliticalDiscussion,Again Italy has a national health care system So does the Netherlands Guess what They have COVID over there too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Outside of political junkies no one knew him That s because outside of Supreme Court justices  which a lot of people still don t know anyways no one cares about judges 
PoliticalDiscussion,It says  and  on my end In any case that d have ground if pell grants were allocated based on race and not correlated more strongly with income based needs 
PoliticalDiscussion,From the other replies in this thread it s clearly not just me Given that face you should ask yourself why are you reading so much into perfectly innocuous terms 
PoliticalDiscussion,Given your understanding of government it s no wonder that the only resource of education on it is from a  year old career politician who has become a millionaire selling people like you bullshit I mean how fucked are you when everything you know about government comes from Bernie Sanders I say supremely fucked so you might as well move to Cuba since Sanders praised their education system which obviously failed you here in America 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stop being a rape apologist   You liberals talk about believing women but you can t even take an hour of your time to actually listen to what this woman has to say   You are no different than Trump supporters 
PoliticalDiscussion,The DNC can t do anything about this because the DNC doesn t control the voters who vote for the nominee If they want to change the rules to take it away from Biden I m very certain that people would straight up leave the President part blank 
PoliticalDiscussion,That doesn t mean anything you are only one person Given that fact you should ask yourself what s wrong with your ability to discern 
PoliticalDiscussion,The media doesn t give a fuck about hurting Sanders Trump or Biden If the story checks out they will report it if it doesn t check out then they won t report it  Obviously it didn t check out so that s why they didn t report it  This story will die just like pizzagate died 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Not everyone is as morally bankrupt as you  Lol Jesus Christ dude Go for a walk 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok good for you It doesnt matter though as theres still a chance your wrong and leaving an election to chance is a bad idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,We don t have enough supplies   every Governor is screaming this from the rooftops   Read about all the shortages already happening with PPE and we are weeks away from peak  Trump is allowing inter state bidding for the same equipment to drive up prices  The fed is supposed to step in and bulk order then distribute not leave the poorer folks to die 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt why use it  Because we still don t have enough ventilators 
PoliticalDiscussion,yes the companies know how to make PPE and Ventilators   they just want to make a profit   
PoliticalDiscussion,Because there needs to be a coordinated response to this problem and the federal government is the leader Government exists for these moments 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you mean  The Fed has promised unlimited funding to the corporations controlling the nominees of both parties  The President can take control of any corporation relevant to national security  Which is pretty much all of the big ones and most of the small ones  The corporations are writing their own industry regulations  It s textbook fascism if not in practice then in principle  Wait until we get a competent power mad populist as CIC with control of Congress the military and the entire military industrial complex 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I think that we generally want the government to have as little control over our lives as possible We don t want an authoritarian state that tries to micromanage us   If times are desperate perhaps the Defense Production Act is necessary But if it doesn t seem like that s the case then I think we should generally avoid letting the government increase its power and seize control of things   Trump and his people have said that companies are voluntarily producing medical supplies and they believe that we ll have enough I don t have any inside information so I don t know enough to contradict them I guess time will tell All I can say for now is that the people in charge don t think the Defense Production Act is necessary So if that s the case then we re better off with it not being used 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government would still be footing the bill here   like it did in ww   The bag they would be holding would be Uncle Sam s bag  You specifically don t have to worry about a companies bottom line Thats the whole point of being able to compel them to save lives in a crisis 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would think though after this crisis a lot of countries will be wanting to stockpile medical supplies for when and if another crisis occurs Meaning anyone producing and distributing should be pursuing long term contracts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well yeah however proably won t be needed to force them as others have stepped up 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,So    it s purpose 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol republicans dont care about minimizing gvmnt control as long as their paymasters stay on top of the market all is gravey  Weather its through deregulation or regulatory capture or ideally both combined  Trump might actually care a little bit about deregulation as an overarching goal but I think a lot of that is still signaling  Anyways they are going to force companies to make millions of masks ventilators and tests big businesses will get trillions in loans and assistance they ll trickle enough down to us to keep the riots down or at least away from their neighborhoods 
PoliticalDiscussion,We do have to Companies are obviously not going to do the right thing on their own 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gay
PoliticalDiscussion,It s handled it so far
PoliticalDiscussion,It is baffling that in times like this there are still people that believe the free market will handle everything   
PoliticalDiscussion,But the poster asked what the ramifications were That s how you determine if it s truly necessary and whether or not to use it
PoliticalDiscussion,No I would have mentioned that had I heard or read that term That doesn t mean that there aren t people using it  I don t read any left leaning sources such as Politico or mediamatters and others of that type 
PoliticalDiscussion,National Socialism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure couldn t tell ya 
PoliticalDiscussion,That combined with companies being left with equipment after the crisis wraps up deters companies from taking action It isn t cheap to recalibrate your systems to produce equipment you aren t specialized in only to know that you could be left holding a bag of items people don t want anymore 
PoliticalDiscussion,The central one would be that the Presidency delivers the wrong instructions The law envisions the White House as understanding approximately how much and of what to manufacture and then using the authority of the law to drive that immediately rather than gambling on the market to respond  which means certain failure in a fast moving crisis   The question is do you think they would get the production elements correct given their performance on everything else so far 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can pretend that this is a whole gov t issue and there is reason to do so  But if you are intellectually honest then you acknowledge that Trump and current GOP have conspired to have ZERO checks and balances that when government is functioning as it has for the most part the past  yr can aid in checking any inappropriate use of power in this manner  Reagan was held in check by a Congress that actually provided oversight as was GHWB Clinton GWB and Obama as well as decades prior to this  It is only this current batch that refuses to do their constitutional obligation to provide oversight  So it is TRUMP and company  i e McConnell that is a larger concern Abuse of power always happens under ANY government system  And worse so under anarchy  But that is WHY we have checks and balances that when a critical mass do their constitutional obligated duty works to correct over time abuses of power  McConnel and team has no interest in the constitution and that as much as trump s issues are what is going sideways 
PoliticalDiscussion,But have they 
PoliticalDiscussion,He could stand up the night before Election Day and say  I did it I m guilty  and y all desperate to destroy trump will vote for him anyway  At the end of the day people don t care about their values Only their team You d betray them in a heartbeat if it meant a guaranteed win and you know it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Better answer than the clearly biased person above I think it also comes down to they shouldn t use it if they don t have to It will strain the relationship between the gov and companies more 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump said in a recent press conference that most companies he s contacted have voluntarily agreed to begin producing medical supplies If the Defense Production Act is unnecessary why use it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your statement as wrong as it goes Even though he invoked it he doesn t want to use it so saying he can t be trusted when he has all the options to go nuts with it right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Republicans will see it as an intolerable amount of governmental influence in business  Which normally you could dismiss as  also known as a day ending in y  But this is something of a special case considering the circumstances 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the only downside is that Republicans try to minimize governmental control over businesses and they would view this as a bad look from a PR perspective 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The obvious is that Trump and company can t be trusted to use their power responsibly    The obvious is that   Trump and company  the government can t be trusted to use their power responsibly
PoliticalDiscussion,Say what 
PoliticalDiscussion,Companies can t charge as much money as they d like to   See Jared Kushner s lil company Oscar Healthcare
PoliticalDiscussion,It may be a time to convert thing   Medical equipment has to be very clean and many facilities may not have those protections in place 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry for the late reply I ve been meaning to reply to your comment properly    gt Trump is probably the most unpopular President amongst that age group in modern history and that there will be higher than average turnout with under  voters based on voting against Trump not necessarily for Biden   This could be true but historically I think negative motivation  i e voting against something rather than for something has been less effective at driving turn outs than positive Also to your other point Biden doesn t have to be   woke  to turn out young people sanders isn t really like that and warren wasn t until pretty late on in her campaign when her hopes of winning were gone instead they were promising a raft of policies that would improve the lives of young people there isn t really all that much politically stopping Biden from doing similar things more credibly than he s done up to now even within the bounds of his centrist outlook   A survey came out the other day showing that Biden doesn t just lack enthusiasm among young people but generally    gt strong enthusiasm for Biden among his supporters  at just   is the lowest on record for a Democratic presidential candidate in  years of ABC Post polls More than twice as many of Trump s supporters are highly enthusiastic about supporting him     Biden makes up some of the difference with those who are  somewhat enthusiastic But he still trails Trump by  points in the combined measure  vs      gt There s d j vu in these results Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in largely the same position four years ago She too had a slim lead among Democrats for the nomination and ran essentially evenly with Trump among registered voters And she lagged in enthusiasm with a low of  very enthusiastic in September  Biden is  points under that mark now   this should be  extremely concerning to the biden camp  democrats and anti trumpers generally and would seem to show the flaws of his suburbs based strategy only Obama has managed to overcome this in recent times This is especially given that the upshot NYT survey above shows biden is not really winning back a significant portion of   obama trump  voters  as of last year  I think it s a decent criticism of the sanders campaign that he didn t try to  reach out and  bridge the gap to more conventional democratic support bases  apart from latinos and young people  but I think the same could be said of the Biden campaign as of now and he is risking a repeat of Clinton s defeat   Clinton secured a decent majority of democratic primary voters based on a similar demographic coalition of mainly older people she failed to  make a play for demographics she was weak with in the primaries and thought anti Trump sentiment suburban desire for normality and the rest of it would carry her through I think there are signs that Biden could be repeating her mistakes as of now 
PoliticalDiscussion,This will come up again later but for now Biden is mostly just on record as one of the many people saying that the Trump Administration has messed up  Bluntly there s not that much space in the political sphere for anything he s got to say coverage of the effects of the coronavirus itself are front and center   and on the sides too 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re not great with nuanced as evinced by  If you don t want MA right now you want poor people to die  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Underdog What is that even supposed to mean It s being pushed by the same people who said Biden is brain dead missing and Hillary     gt You re going to tell me they are being honest brokers about this  By underdog they mean Sanders  Now that Dear Leader is losing all methods are back on the table to destroy the Democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Anita Dunn is not on the board   My mistake I edited the comment    gt It s a massive stretch to think this has any bearing on this situation   Imagine if this story was about Trump If Times Up refused to help a victim of Trump and you found out that Steve Bannon had an influential role in the organization would you dismiss that as irrelevant 
PoliticalDiscussion,Think that there s a shot to remove McConnell I keep thinking about Beshear restoring voting rights to  people who d served their prison sentences but not all of those people are Democrats  or will even vote and it looks like McConnell won his last race by about  votes But McConnell s unpopular I think Trump will have negative tailcoats even in Kentucky and some new turnout by Dems could make it a close race 
PoliticalDiscussion,In so far as it s meant to be an Alternate Brand Equivalent to the  alt right  presumably it would best apply to groups like the Leninist Stalinist Maoist political axis followers of ideologies that no longer find much currency with the  mainstream of left wing politics  In popular usage it seems to more or less be an attempt to label antifa to create the perception that antifa are  just as bad as the groups that chose to self label as alt right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Beshear was a nice win against an unpopular incumbent but the GOP flipped both the AG  where Beshear was incumbent and SoS positions by healthy margins  Dems are also historically strong in local races in Kentucky  Beshear might lift some Dem candidates up over the next few years which is a great thing but overall Kentucky is pretty solidly red 
PoliticalDiscussion,The point is that there weren t even  rumors of behavior like this from Biden in the over  years he s been in public life DC is a small town full of the worst gossips you could imagine If Biden was a guy who tried to sleep with women in his office lots and lots of people would know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Giving up freedoms
PoliticalDiscussion,The obvious is that Trump and company can t be trusted to use their power responsibly and in the best interest of the American people going by the ongoing track record 
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t seen anything to indicate that  days would be enough of a break I ve been assuming this will last months
PoliticalDiscussion,It has a real  swift boat vibe about it Attacking his strengths etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what people used to say about Pennsylvania for the GOP as well  I agree that Cornyn and Trump will win Texas in November but I think  will be a different story if Trump is reelected 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Anita Dunn is not on the board She s part of a PR form that has worked with Times Up It s a massive stretch to think this has any bearing on this situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean Florida

PoliticalDiscussion,The left isn t holding the right wing to calling covid the Wuhan virus 
PoliticalDiscussion,For all of Biden s faults he hasn t been accused so much as cheating on his wife or any type of sexual deviancy   He has lived a very public life for decades including the vice presidency   So I understand why Biden supporters are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt in this situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lazy 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  You mention how you dont know how Biden s plan would be successful  I think there is a possibility that Biden will win  And that if he does then he will most likely to deliver universal coverage And that is a success  What is not clear is how it will successfully attack the other two issues which are outcomes and cost  With MA it is very clear how cost will be reduced  We already know the administration costs of medicare in the USA  We know they are lower  It is clear how some money will be saved   gt Outside of incredible taxation  which is the only way a single payer can raise funds compared to a mutli  there isnt much else that we know  You can pay for health care with a flat premium or a progressive tax  The wealthy are better off  financially with a flat premium and the poor are better of with a progressive tax  So if you want more inequality you should go with premiums  And if you want less you should go with the tax system  If you don t address inequality you will get worse health outcomes  See stuff like this    There are well funded opponents to fixing the US in general and US health care specifically  What I see is that Bernie articulates problems and approaches for solutions without detail  Warren provided more detailed plans  Biden cares about people but does not want structural change to the system that causes the problems  Trump lies and mismanages the government  Amy Klobacher used to have a page  now gone articulating the power of the president to effect changes without congress  And there is significant scope 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Political correctness exists as much on the right as much as the left mate  Only because the left started it and holds the right to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,She ran it on Intercept with Ryan Grim  a hardcore Sanders supporter  Vox just picked it up afterwards 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can we just mention the lack of accusations against President Obama  The man is a class act in every sense of the word 
PoliticalDiscussion,She changed her story from uncomfortably close and non sexual  her words in  to she got fingered in  which gained traction   This really doesn t help her at all changing her story 
PoliticalDiscussion,Spencer coined it so the backwash from calling yourself a altright would not confer  hes a white supremacist thing is  Spencer IS a white supremacist   Its like trying to rebrand a nuclear bomb by calling it a  mushroom bomb You can do that but it probably won t change opinions on the nuclear bomb because it still a nuclear bomb 
PoliticalDiscussion,I really like Sanders but some of his supporters really scare me Just yesterday two different posters called Biden and Epstein the same   Even when I explained the difference in the accusations  Epstein was actually charged prosecuted the women became state witnesses they testified under oath in open court vs Biden accuser who just went to a few newspapers or organizations  Again I pointed out that I m not saying Ms Reader is lying I was saying you have to let the accusation be investigated by other reputable news sources before going forward with it That isn t to say she should be silenced or called a liar She might very well be telling the truth   The response was  So I m right Biden is just like Epstein  
PoliticalDiscussion,What new information is there to report 
PoliticalDiscussion,We re on the third or fourth revision of Tara Reade s story at this point  Each time it becomes more lurid and the details actively contradict one another 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know I agree irrelevant to the act relevant to companies stepping up to help   Granted I think we both agree they re not doing this all out of good will They def will benefit through multiple channels wether it s good standing with the government and possible preferential treatment good press for them Nothings free in life 
PoliticalDiscussion,The USA was founded on the principal that we don t trust the government with unlimited power Our founding documents took great pains to describe the many things that the government is not allowed to do The founding fathers warned that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance Its patriotic to continually question the government and fight to maintain our rights Advocating obsequious to the government is frankly the traitor s goal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean The GOP has done everything they can to delay and neuter the bill I blame them because they re the ones doing it Has nothing to do with being right or left One party gives a damn The other doesn t It s very plain to see 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no excuse People are dying at an increasing rate including our badly needed medical personnel There is no reason not to invoke the DPA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump has poorly managed all of this He was the reason why all of this mess started and I definitely think this will come back to haunt him I feel like his approval rating improvement is insignificant in the sense that it would have improved with any other president during a pandemic disaster People just want someone to listen to whether what is said is true or false 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correct it s in several TPP member nations which makes it irrelevant to the Defense Act being discussed   Likewise with Unilever which is an EU based company 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think Bernie would ever be inappropriate Honestly I wonder if he use to be a bit shy when he was a lot younger  But yeah I already know how most of the Bernie subs would go full Td
PoliticalDiscussion,One could be if the White House is too aggressive in prioritizing US aquisition over other countries such that other countries also begin hoarding important medical goods specifically if the US begins overproducing said goods This could have a ripple affect where the US is unable to acquire such goods from foreign suppliers because those countries reacted in kind also effectively started hoarding supply far beyond what they needed and denying other countries access 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure I believe they just said immediately I ll have to look it up 
PoliticalDiscussion,We can see what they voted on and how everyone voted Also many congressma s statements on their votes The delay was clearly because of issues not related to covid being placed in the bill This eas the overwhelming response of no voters And the anti abortion riders were placed in by republican congressman  Besides the st failed vote which had issues with money only going to large corporations  The only logical options when you understand this are to       agree the abortion riders made sense to include         agree there was no place for non covid related issues in a relief bill        believe the bill that was eventually signed is so insufficient you dont even care about what went wrong with the it initially             None of this requires supporting democratic congresspeople But its important to understand where the issues with this specifically came from In my opinion it was republicans caring more about their agenda than helping those affected As for Trump himself he s still talking about everything being fine by easter and hospitals needing less repirators than they claim He caused our delayed action as much as anyone in Congress And thats a whole different post in itself Anyone who thinks trump is handling this well isnt paying attention And i can understand that but I wont waste my time discussing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did they give a timescale for that   
PoliticalDiscussion,Severabity is a thing that they prepare for It s also a means of ensuring bloc conciliation I don t see the point of the question tbh There s a reason to do both  The new world is all non essentials going back to the day to day after massive amounts of people have been furloghed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hope it is enough   
PoliticalDiscussion,At least he was representing his constituents 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  I used hyperbole to emphasize the ridiculous nature of your point     nbsp I    most certainly   missed your hyperbole  please point to that in your postings 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hmm yeah I ve heard the country that looks like a shoe right Have you also heard that it s a sovereign nation and the defense act has not power in Italy Or were you not aware of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then don t say you are going to have   you set the bar you re held to the bar 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ask yourself this how would they respond if someone made the exact same accusation against Bernie   They would equivocate argue that she s a MSM shill a Clinton stooge   I m not saying Bernie would be inappropriate towards women it honestly doesn t seem in his character But just ask yourself how they would respond and that tells you everything you need to know 
PoliticalDiscussion,An incompetent bungler with would be authoritarian tendencies can have other motivations such as being easily manipulated by different individuals valuing corporations over the national interest feeling it d be bad optics    But then I m not exactly engaging someone who s participating in good faith ignorance here am I  Well given your claims about italy ignorance is definitely possible    
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I get what you mean So i beg the question again should congress combine smaller bills into fewer massive super bills   Also i feel like it depends on what you mean by  a new world  Really until Trump is out of office the new world won t be coming anytime soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey look he did it   Yesterday the president ordered General Motors to make ventilators under the Act He must do the same for PPE Only by ordering U S industries to increase the supply of PPE will we ensure all health care workers have access to the tools we need to stay safe during this pandemic Otherwise many of us  myself included  are at exceptionally high risk of being exposed and infected 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you heard about Italy 
PoliticalDiscussion,The fact we are comparing what Al Franken did to Roy Moore a pedophile is the toxic part of this movement   Franken deserved an ethics investigation and a chance to explain himself He ended up a notch on Gillibrand s belt to bolster her political career Did that forward the movement No   But if we are just setting out to create an ultimate purity test for Democrats then don t be surprised when the  MeToo movement remains bound within one political party while Republicans continue to win elections and empower the government to ignore these very initiatives   And Tina Smith is great Totally separate point though 
PoliticalDiscussion,At rPolitics Vox was linked constantly I assumed  they were the original source The Intercept isn t exactly any better Again the RW stuff really made me less sorry for the outlet Surprisingly Fox News even listed her Pro Putin comments but I don t believe they have latched onto this story like the TV hosts will 
PoliticalDiscussion,The ideal scenario would be that the president has experts that are knowledgeable in these areas and could provide these numbers   Who knows if that would be reality under this administration though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Both have pros and cons like everything else But none can be successful in the current system 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are acting like this supply chain isn t already broken   Trump has experts phones email   they can make a list and check it twice   Literally millions of people are employed in middle management for our healthcare system   Right now the doctors and governor s are saying  We are out of supplies   Trump is saying  You cant just tell us what you need You should have bought it yourself  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not making a comment about the Intercept lol  If you check my post history I don t see Intercept as a credible source I m just pointing out that the publication that first broke the story in  was the Intercept not Vox 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Did I say anything about testing I haven t followed Oscars role here  You re the one who made the assertion they are benefiting from Trump not using defense production act   gt Thats Donald territory   he turned down the free WHO testing kits to wait and have them produced here  That s completely false but you re welcome to try and find a source Didn t turn them down and why the fuck do you think if we did use the WHO test they d be free   gt  a test sounds good vs free right  What does the cost of testing have to do with anything but our healthcare system Again what in the world makes you think they d be free 
PoliticalDiscussion,must   not   Google   underwear masks   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s just disappointing to me I work on the  front lines and I feel that congress is incoherent Blame the republicans if you want Fine with me I m as moderate as anyone gets so I naturally distaste both sides   If there is one possible good thing that Trump has done it is that he has removed any complacency from congress  or at least I hope so  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because Russia interfered with our election and those on the right have previously tried to weaponize Me Too to attack Liz Warren  an abusive BDSM Dom to a  year old marine and Mayor Pete  false sexual assault   So it is understandable to view her claims with a heavy dose of skeptisim Is it possible she is true YES Is it okay to be skeptical because of her sudden shift in politics from her prior fawning praise of her boss to her blogs on Putin and Russia Yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,As many as they can as fast as they can with full authority to take over other production lines  There s no chance we re going to scale up production to meet demand especially of ventilators We might get lucky and come close if we started a few months ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah at the risk of sounding like an ass that doesn t help her case I mean after that Reality Winner stuff I stop taking Intercept seriously
PoliticalDiscussion,Spoiler alert some ideals are better than others  I ll let you work out which 
PoliticalDiscussion,They ve had no problem with hypocrisy so far 
PoliticalDiscussion,Was that sarcasm 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you genuinely think would be in a  non idealistic  unpartisan and solely dutiful bill that was a response to the corona pandemic  There s going to be like a solid two three months of quarantine at least why would you not prepare for us all non essentials coming out of our caves to see the new world 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt since they promise k ventilators immediately but now are saying they ll only have k by the end of April  It s almost as if adapting existing manufacturing capacity to make a completely unfamiliar product that has  parts takes time 
PoliticalDiscussion,I liked Al Franken a lot but keeping him around wasn t tenable at all It would ve required willfully ignoring all these examples of him being a creepy jackass  I think Dems could have lost the special election in Alabama without the ability to show that they take these sorts of allegations more seriously than the other party does  I also think this Franken nostalgia is disrespectful to Tina Smith who s been a fantastic and effective senator who doesn t have a bunch of dumb sexist photos in her past 
PoliticalDiscussion, Alt Right was originally a rebranding effort by fascists and other degenerates to get away from their terrible image Importantly it started as a bunch of losely connected online movements The importance of online forums like reddit and Chan as well as media platforms like youtube cannot be overstated in this context Thousands of young people were radicalized through gamergate TiA redpill and other subs Youtubers like Sargon of Arkad  I think is his name gained massive popularity and slowly devolved further and further to the right to capture their audience more Fringe  thinkers like Molyneux jumped on the train Bankrollers like Breitbart and the Koch Brothers helped spread the movement further   The term alt left was also coined on the right  as a means to draw a false equivalence I do think it could be reasonably defined though as the part of the left characterized by its online presence radicalism impotence and focus on rage and conspiracy theories  These people have actually been in online forums and youtube talking heads for at least as long as the alt right but have recently gained significant momentum as the fringe of the Bernie party I m talking about channels like Secular Talk or The Young Turks Not trying to equivocate the two losely defined movements as one is far worse than the other but their features are partially analogous 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you re being intentionally obtuse I used hyperbole to emphasize the ridiculous nature of your point   Or what at least I can gather to be your point as your writing seems allergic to elaboration and relies on unclear innuendo  Let s break it down   You were surprised to hear that racist groups organized the UTR rally   You then dismissed that claim by comparing the number of attendees to a very rough estimate of the number of such people who exist in the US   I tried to point out how that argument was flawed by pointing to actions taken by these groups which are evidence for how they organized it The videos documentary I posted isn t terribly long has little commentary and covers these topics straight from organizer s mouths  And unrelated to our conversation but after a bit a profile snooping I have to inform you that     is truly equal to  You re totes wrong that it isn t and essentially every mathematician in the world disagrees with you 
PoliticalDiscussion,It took so long to pass because the GOP fought against a bunch of it and tried to add anti abortion riders One of them even forced Congress back to vote on it again after it passed It s not hard to understand why it took so long 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did I say anything about testing I haven t followed Oscars role here  Thats Donald territory   he turned down the free WHO testing kits to wait and have them produced here   a test sounds good vs free right  And sure Joshua started it and named it Oscar after their Grandad   Im sure Jared never put in a dime via Thrive Capital
PoliticalDiscussion, gt On the other hand I would be surprised if the sources I read or hear would NOT use the term if it were in widespread use  So if the term is in widespread use you would expect to read or hear about it in your sources and news 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t have any inside information so I don t know enough to contradict them  How can you contradict someone who repeatedly contradicts himself 
PoliticalDiscussion, Ideals benefit certain people and hurt others it s just a matter of who you hurt in the process and the problem is that both sides extreme ideals want to hurt a different subset of people   Yes all of those things are fantastic and will help people in the future But why now This also begs the question of should the government just pass larger spending bills so that more stuff is in it to help a wider range of people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Especially given trump is polling around  on the question if he is handling the pandemic appropriately
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree   Since we don t know what that next crisis might look like what treatment might be necessary or how far away it is no country or healthcare system will misuse capital to stockpile excess equipment that may never be used 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll answer your question if you tell me    what   in my post to which you replied made you think that    I thought   you were lying about    something you DID NOT write    I    never   read that you asserted that it is  a popular term as of late    nbsp You ve been placed on a very short leash 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ooooh omg you got me one company isn t based in the US Dang you killed my argument  Lmao I m shocked you thought that comment was worth even typing
PoliticalDiscussion,What about medical alcohol for sterilisation What about IV bags  What about test kits What about lung capacity testing stations   There s a bunch of things that only people in the medical field know about and know how much they need of each   I don t know exactly what they require but it s kinda like saying to fight a war all we need is bullets and helmets ignore that other stuff
PoliticalDiscussion,You act as if  ideals in political philosophy is something extraneous to literally the well being of people  If it was libertarians their ideals would be to not do this It s not like bargaining your water with someone dying of thirst Efficacy of things aside sustainable infrastructure production entitlements and worker protections are things that would help  I d feel differently if it was something like   gt btw the hyde amendment is gone
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you re grossly misinformed No one is dying bc of a shortage in anything right now    All of this is just to be prepared   Jesus man 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only sources I read are PBS Politico and BBC as all three are highly factual and not biased American news outlets  CNN NBC Fox tend to be too biased for my liking   But I do agree that the oversight and relief was a majority of the bill It s definitely a shame that it had to be in there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump himself could have a role in the organization as far as I m concerned  either the reason they provided passes the smell test or it doesn t Does the explanation about campaigns check out or was it a one time exception for Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,And in the meantime people are dying Sucks to be them I guess But good to know the  free market  works 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of those Dyson is based in
PoliticalDiscussion,Almost all of the health manufacturers are ramping up their production as fast as they can  It s the outside companies that has the skills to make an item that is needed such as Tesla and GM saying they would medical equipment we can force those companies into making them instead of cars  I know my company makes the test kits and we use to only make  a week and now we are expected to make almost X as many per week by running x  We really can t make anymore unless we convert other lines to the building of kits to test COVID  but then we can t make the needed medical supplies that line might have even making 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It wasn t Trump who was delaying the  trillion dollar relief bill so that things like Windmills could be included   No it was the Republicans who delayed the Bill because they were triggered by things like efficient energy sources being included   And just a quick reminder that the GOP bill excluded aid for average income Americans and created a  B slush fund for the Trump administration to use at it s discretion without accountability   The Democrat bill is the reason you re getting help not just Wall Street billionaires 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I heavily criticize Trump for calling this a hoax and he was a major factor for this I don t think it is miopic because I don t think it is necessary in a time when Americans are in need of relief This is a time when ideals have to be pushed to the side  It is just pathetic imo that both sides have to try and squeeze in their ideals just because a bill this large has a lot of  wiggle room  I understand why they did it I just hate that it had as much importance as American lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao you make zero sense Saying he can t be trust it that s why he doesn t use it no one is stopping him from using it If he s so power hungry he would ve used it lmao Dude stop I know you hate him but at least make sensible arguments  
PoliticalDiscussion,The DEMS held it up not for freaking windmills They held it up to include OVERSIGHT  so that large corporations could not do what they did with the tax bill and just enrich themselves and continue to screw working class  and to prevent Trump directly benefitting BECAUSE THAT IS ILLEGAL ALREADY but that has not stopped him so far  Read a broader set of news and information Your bubble is too small  we all have one I do too but I work at making it wider all the time  
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,It really is And on a side note this is the really toxic part of the  MeToo movement that liberals need to address   People are weaponizing sexual misconduct allegations in order to further political agendas   It s taking away from the part of the movement that could actually benefit society 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He wouldn t use it to force non medical companies to make things   he could force the companies already making the equipment to make more    The companies making it can t make more They don t have excess manufacturing capacity and staff sitting around unused   The whole point of it is to force non medical companies to start making medical equipment 
PoliticalDiscussion,I imagine that additional supplies are currently being produced Trump has said that he s spoken to a number of companies that are currently ramping up production But I have no way of knowing if what they re doing is enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,Saying you can t trust  anyone is basically giving up on the idea of responsible government which frankly is the traitors s goal I believe that a fullscale purge of the Republicans would remove the worst of the rot as they re the sole party which has malicious inaction and undermining the response to these crises as their official policy You can t blame the firemen for trying to put out the fire that is Republican profiteering and maliciou willful ignorance and inaction 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt yes the companies know how to make PPE and Ventilators    I thought the point of invoking this act was to direct companies that   don t  make ventilators or PPE to adapt their existing manufacturing capacity to meet the sudden demand 
PoliticalDiscussion,Further economic harm as companies will eventually need to shift toward profit maximization forms of production when the coronavirus crisis ends It s expensive as hell to change sourcing and production 
PoliticalDiscussion,They dont  keep the bag   the govt pays for its production and owns it   Ford Motors didn t get to keep the b bombers they made in ww   and they certainly didn t go bankrupt   I have no sympathy for  healthcare that disregards health
PoliticalDiscussion,It s like city s skyline where if you mess up your town and people start dying all the houses magically repopulate because housing prices have plummet to nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t trust anyone in congress I do blame Trump for a lot of this as I think he is been terrible with many of his comments but I do think the entire government has exacerbated the problem I am still concerned about why it took so long for the   Trillion package to be passed and that is not necessarily due to Trump s incompetence 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve heard neoliberal plenty of times This dude is just crazy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interest rate cuts over the past four years going into a viral pandemic they had three months to prepare for is what falls on Trump and the GOP Honestly criticizing a delayed because they wanted to add in additional provisions to protect and enfranchise workers is so incredibly miopic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just to not I read that is  She shed he shed  I  was very confused for a moment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Holding the bag of items not at a market rate Companies are liable to take a hit but that s not a good reason not to utilize the law It s a time of crisis and part of the role of the executive is to lead during it 
PoliticalDiscussion, companies from what I know Dyson Tesla Ford unilever m Apple Multiple college engineers have made plans for ventilators and are working to get them FDA approved 
PoliticalDiscussion,Main idea is that the companies with the resources should step up but the reason why they aren t is because it would cost them money to operate without revenue That is also part of the  Trillion package because it provides them with financial stability while mass producing medical equipment
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey do you have a link for when she changed her story 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wuhan is the global epicenter of automotive parts production most auto supply chains have been broken for two months   you wont find new cars being made anywhere right now  We are in a crisis and need more equipment   Very specifically Ventilators and PPE  why do we have thousands at home sewing non medical masks to donate to our first world medical system right now   Any potential long term problems with supply are coming either way   the globe is shut down  Most of our generic medication comes from India and China so what happens if we cant compel US companies to make it here We ll run out next month   Imagine if we acted this way during ww  People  gt Profit
PoliticalDiscussion,What s wrong with it He  doesn t want to use it right now but his track record is that of a man who can t be trusted to use this sort of power responsibly and who consistently tries to use his other powers in ways that violate the law and guidelines  It s like saying a bank robber can t be trusted to follow the law despite being reluctant to commit a particular theft 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you think I m lying about the term neoliberal being a popular term of late 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A lack of self awareness is what you re not aware of  You want to set Democrats up to lose  AGAIN 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your dumbass doesn t even know what the company does Also it s his brother who was a co founder not him  Oscar is not involved in the actual process of COVID testing or in the manufacturing of such a test Oscar created a website  open to the public  that screens users to see if they qualify for a test and then provides a list of testing sites nearby     
PoliticalDiscussion,The federal government is saying they don t want to use  big business to tell private company s what to do It s what the law is for The law was made for this moment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right The government can say company a you make x and company b you make y even if both companies would rather make x Also a government order gives some protection from lawyers stock holders and competitors if the morally right thing to do isn t competitive or profitable 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s certainly used as an insult now but that doesn t detract from the fact that the Alt Right initially coined it as a self descriptor by people on the far right It s just that they didn t change their actual views any so it quickly became tainted by said views Milo and Joe and the others get brushed with it as well because they uncritically associate with and promote people from the Richard Spencer end of the political spectrum 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have they Who has stepped up How much can they provide 
PoliticalDiscussion,But how many of each   There s been a focus on ventilators for example but they re only useful with other equipment and if dozens of companies are suddenly make huge numbers of them will other specialised medical equipment be ignored  Also some factories are probably better suited to running normal production because for example if truck parts stop being produced within a few months you would see a fall off in transport for these supplies   Idk if the White house or anyone has the level of insight to know exactly how much of each thing the medical industry and all the support industries around it need
PoliticalDiscussion,You re not necessarily wrong but Trump doesnt have unilateral control It wasn t Trump who was delaying the  trillion dollar relief bill so that things like Windmills could be included   I do think Trump has a decent bit of responsibility but congress has made an absolute mess of this and it only helps Trump tbh 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well as of now the Federal Government is saying that by their estimation the Defense Production Act is unnecessary Maybe they re right maybe they re wrong I don t know 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe that in other countries standards have been slightly lowered for emergency manufacturing  Also factories in any industry should be relatively clean already I don t think it would be a huge stretch to meet higher standards 
PoliticalDiscussion,He wouldn t use it to force non medical companies to make things   he could force the companies already making the equipment to make more    Instead we have Hanes making  underwear masks 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s activated it giving him the ability to use it like he threatens General Motors the other day to use it since they promise k ventilators immediately but now are saying they ll only have k by the end of April and are asking for a high price for the ventilators But he hasn t actually used it on anyone yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,I couldn t tell ya exactly what s happening on this front I imagine that additional ventilators are being produced by someone I guess time will tell if what we re doing is sufficient 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean microbial clean  not just dust free 
PoliticalDiscussion,Should be making components to support the medical device companies that know what they re doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,The one that was made to benefit corporations and said fuck everyone else And everyone has a wish list Pelosi is smart enough to know what is viable and what isn t and negotiate accordingly As for narrative Every thing I mentioned happened That isn t narrative That s fact Attaching anti abortion riders to an emergency bill was a non starter and the GOP did it anyway You can t blame dems for saying no to that It would be reprehensible if they had let the original bill stand 
PoliticalDiscussion,It reads like Fox News on Trump 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol my man Yes it does It s probably the best write up you ll find regarding his situation   The best part It s done well after the raw emotion is removed from the situation Almost everyone who called on him to resign save one person regretted it   They regretted it for a reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be honest why even have firefighters They just stand around all day when was the last time there was a fire Really no point in paying them  Next time there is a fire we can get them back    easy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t be bothered to read the whole thing Did it address the other eight accusations 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We re on the third or fourth revision of Tara Reade s story at this point  She never changed her story There were several incidents with Joe Biden the inappropriate touching kissing and smelling then there s demanding that she be a server because she had nice legs and then there was the rape incident  She spoke of the first two when Lucy Flores accused Joe Biden of doing the same thing and Joe responded by calling her accusations  Politically motivated  She then revealed the third to Time sUp in January of this year Time sUp had also collaborated this It was in then in March that she went public She never said there was one incident where she was touched and then changed her story that in that same incident she was penetrated There were several incidents  Out of curiosity how did you conclude that there were any revisions let alone four From all the major articles on this it s pretty much impossible to make this conclusion as far as I can tell at least I am very curious to how you came to this conclusion    gt And she s actively trying to cover her own tracks by deleting things she s written in the past about the way American policy is handling Russia and its bearing on how she exited the political scene  For context here is the Vox reporting on this because I feel this commenters summary is a bit distorted    gt In particular critics pointed to that now deleted  Medium post in which Reade called Putin  a compassionate caring visionary leader and said  To President Putin I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do with eyes of love   gt   gt In the same post she wrote that she left government work in her s in part because  I love Russia with all my heart and  I could not stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government   gt   gt Reade told Vox that when she wrote the praise of Putin she had  watched a bunch of Noam Chomsky and was working on a novel set in Russia She says she no longer feels the same way about Putin since learning more about domestic violence in Russia  gt   gt But  this conversation isn t about Russia  she told Vox  Joe Biden wasn t asking me about my feelings about Russia when he had his hands where they weren t supposed to be    gt the available data strongly suggests she is  Please elaborate on this data The most skeevy thing about her that I can find was the weird Russia post   As far as accusations against powerful men this is one of more credible ones Not Dr Ford credible but it s up there Some of Weinsteins Ailes Cosby s accusations were not collaborated Tara Reade has  collaborators Journalists have also verified that she worked for Biden at the time of her accusations 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lmao this is the narrative now Did you miss the  T bill the Dems stonewalled Did you miss the pelosi wishlist 
PoliticalDiscussion,No she doesn t manage  their PR firm She manages a PR firm that this organization has used before Her firm has hundreds of clients if not more She doesn t work  for Time s Up in any sense and has no say in what they do because her only connection to the group is that the company  she works for was paid by them to do some ad campaigns You re just completely off the mark here 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If we need someone to replace an elderly candidate we have about  other recent candidates who could easily take his place  Anyone other than Warren who would take all the worst parts of bidens and bernies campaigns and combine them would split the party if they were picked over sanders   gt You think that having a  year old recent cardiac patient who has to travel back and forth to Washington is a valuable  sub for Joe Biden  No but hes the only sub There are no other options   gt I understand you are disappointed that he s effectively lost this primary  No I supported mayor Pete and Biden though I m from ireland where I support the centre right party fine geal I personally highly dislike Bernie and think he was this years worst demicratic candidate other than Bloomberg he is essentially the Democrats equivalent of trump and americas equivalent of corbyn a comparison that needs to made more though he was still better than clinton  Theres just simply no other option if something happens to biden anything s better than  more years of trump destroying not only the u s but the world  Ignore your political views for a second bernie is the only option if the worst happens I m not saying it s likely to happen this is a worse case scenario 
PoliticalDiscussion,None that outweigh saving American lives atm But leadership is devoid from the oval office I m afraid 
PoliticalDiscussion, Read   away 
PoliticalDiscussion,did you even read the bill Nancy Pelosi and the house Dems tried to pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a fascist and authoritarian law that borders on national socialism  NAZI    It s literally the president nationalizing businesses and forcing them to make something   If there is a need for ventilators the market is completely capable of doing that Supply and demand work There s no reason to believe that president trump or any small group of people for that matter are capable of correctly determining what products the entire market demands and what quantities should be produced  That s the exact reason communism failed Central planning doesn t work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolute Chad
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is once again the incorrect analogy   It s the first analogy I ve made     gt Anita Dunn has no role in the organization   She manages their PR firm Seems like a major role to me I stand by my analogy 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only drawback comes in the form of market intervention and profit loss Manufacturers have orders to fill and shareholders looking for earnings The DPA means the government compels you to produce something and ultimately decides what you ll be paid to do it It s a terrible argument against invoking it The federal government has a better ability to coordinate need and supply chains The US military is the greatest logistics force on the planet and bringing them into the effort would streamline what factories make which products and where those finished products go The only complicated engineering is the ventilators but there are already new designs that are cheap to produce open sourced and effective There is absolutely no rational reason to not be making PPE in massive amounts The engineering is simple and the materials are easily sourced 
PoliticalDiscussion, It s more probable that the Democratic and Republican Parties realign into the  s The Democratic Party is undisputedly shifting to the Progressive wing which tends to turn off some of their factions Republicans are realigning with working class middle America and should be making a play for disenfranchised Democrats who aren t in favor of the more extremist views emerging The suburbs are the battleground of the current and certainly will decide future elections but I imagine cities will eventually be split in someway with the gentrification efforts that have happened over the past couple decades especially as those young families begin to age and become more conservative  or even relatively conservative in their later years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Franken had  nine accusers Which one didn t rise to harrasement level All of them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because she took down Franken The guy with  nine accusers 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So if somebody praises Vladimir Putin it s physically impossible for them to get assaulted  This narrative is being pushed super hard by a lot of anti Biden people and it s completely disingenuous She s making a claim that Biden sexually assaulted her in  Since this will be her word against his we need to examine the credibility of both  Her essay on Putin was completely bizarre If she wrote an essay about how wonderful Pol Pot was for the people of Cambodia it would be completely justified in dismissing her credibility because she s obviously not mentally well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Plus he d probably start mumbling and going off topic anyways   I feel bad for him really Everyone parading him around when I m not too sure he knows entirely what s going on He needs to stay home and spend time with him family while he can 
PoliticalDiscussion,Focusing on manufacturing PAPRs is probably the right answer They provide the most security for healthcare workers Without them doctors are afraid of performing intubation or other certain procedures that could aerolize the virus 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt you found out that Steve Bannon had an influential role in the organization  This is once again the incorrect analogy Anita Dunn has  no role in the organization None Do you want to try a third time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Antifa s perspective doesnt really change the whole violence and destruction of property or just their general idk not the political norm nature  nor does their communist flags help tbh    Even if we said that every event Antifa attacked or disrupted was entirely fascist I don t think most anyone really buys the idea that their actions are neccessary or helpful by any measure If antifa never showed up these small rallies never bring about an ethnostate or genocide     or really anything aside from waving their own bad flags 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,He didn t fire all of them but he did fold their team into the same team as nuclear disasters and other stuff  Streamlining the government by making the same team have to handle several entirely different disasters that require entirely different expertise This led to many of the remaining ones leaving their jobs I don t blame them  I had spent my life studying and preventing epidemics and suddenly my boss wanted me to make a plan for a volcanic eruption because he dissolved the team previously responsible for that I would be damn tempted to quit too  Existing plans and reports would survive but the capability to update and implement them was reduced 
PoliticalDiscussion, Testing sites in every target Walmart and Walgreens 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trump if pushed to do something useful with the DPA could lose tens of millions of dollars or lose the option to collect tens of millions in bribes later because he destroys the profit margins for various large corporations by making them work for the common good at the expense of the Shareholder and C Suite leadership 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our healthcare professionals are having to wear trash bags for PPE it s not like things can get much worse
PoliticalDiscussion,There are various components to the DPA For example the government can promise to buy x number of a certain item at a predetermined price So by invoking the DPA a company like GM can be confident that the federal government will buy x number of ventilators respirators at a reasonable price making it less risky for them to retool production lines and churn out medical equipment 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t think the president has the ability to gather these experts What s the point of the FDA and CDC if they couldn t answer these questions 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If times are desperate    I mean if there was a global pandemic or something happening then maybe we should give the government more control  s
PoliticalDiscussion,I think Florida will probably go for Trump as it stands right now  Barring a sudden demographic change if the virus gets bad enough   I think for the foreseeable future it will stay a swing state unless there is a major shift in the platforms of one or both parties 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not easy to change from one manufacturing to another Equipment is very specialized and the supply chain is complicated What the fed should do is find the raw supplies needed and deliver to the right manufacturers That would speed shit up    Saying  build it you isnt as easy as it sounds
PoliticalDiscussion,Long reply I m a supply chain and logistics minded individual so my points are around that  My main concerns with invoking the Defense Production Act in this instance are the vast unknowns in what the effects will be on supply chains and operations Think about the warehouse and depot level supply hubs upstream in the supply chain  things like the nuts and bolts and raw materials that go into making ventilators and other medical supplies Plus the man hours and transportation considerations that go into moving these things and coordinating the most rapid and efficient output It s a complicated system  The way things are right now companies are coming forward having done their due diligence to talk about what they can realistically deliver in output with all these things combined This includes companies like GM and Ford talking with their suppliers who in turn talk with theirs etc The most accurate way to figure out what our economy can realistically produce is for them to figure it out  not a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington Add to this the available man power man hours and the ability to pay them  Any mis calculation on where and when to send capital and labor will result in an excess of inventory and an inability to maximize our output This can severely hurt us in the long run  I ve been listening to the Trump administration on this pretty closely  their argument is that they don t think its necessary but the truth is probably that they  and no one in the United States truly has a grasp on supply chain changes needed for a plan and solution that s better than what the market can provide Trump repeatedly says we don t need to invoke the Act  yet  I d be surprised if the government didn t have a team on this or at least some outside consultants doing the economics to model out the right variables We just don t have any precedent to go off of yet for the government to comfortably take control  My guess is that at this very moment in time ventilators and other medical equipment in a pandemic are not as scalable as say aircraft tanks and bullets in a wartime environment  in total war I could just appoint a VP of Operations from Northrup Grumman to oversee a Ford plant and bring them into their supply chain for example  I wouldn t be surprised however if over the summer the administration finally has enough data points to invoke the Act This would involve an SOP with a subparagraph somewhere that says something like  We have determined the cost of converting an automobile warehouse for medical grade ventilators is  XXX Consultations with XXX number of suppliers and vendors have confirmed they can supply materials for XXXXX number of ventilators per month At a federally mandated price point of  XXXX per ventilator we are asking Congress to subsidize the price up to  XXXX   In short I d rather see the market show us what they can actually output so the government can actually understand what variables are holding them up from what we need Until then invoking the Act will probably place unrealistic goals on a complex supply chain causing a bullwhip effect where vendors are sitting on so much stock that they can t meet demand for product in the future 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mormons demographically are only  of the population now and if outsiders keep moving in that number is going to continue to go down I don t see Utah s economy getting worse anytime soon so I bet it s a continuing trend  I also think it s fair to point out that Utahns hated Hilary the voted for Bernie in the primaries 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no such thing as an  alt left and trying to legitimize the term doesn t serve anyway      Antifa is a reactionary group that basically only exists to push back on a new wave of violent degenerates seeking to  ethnically cleanse the United States They are not an  alt left       The  alt right is a pro fasicst pro racism group that was formed mostly out of billoinaire funding and white supremacists The term  alt right itself is a white supremacist  branding term The idea was to label racism as  alt right since if you label it as well   white supremacist people wouldn t like it      The sides don t have to be equal There never was an alt left 
PoliticalDiscussion,She lives in a world she didn t choose  Like everyone  So happy I was born white christian American republican so I can disown everyone else

PoliticalDiscussion,SUkc my p for free rev u FrostBBM wanna help 
PoliticalDiscussion,Friend I live in the south So yes I d say so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Investing in human health  Waste of capital   Would you say its a waste of capital to shut down the US economy specifically because our healthcare stockpile is empty and our hospital capacities are maxed out  Trillions lost in stock market vs a couple hundred billion invested in being ready next time  PS Your comment implies this is a one time deal   Corona will be here for years unless we get a vaccine made and distributed globally  This is the honeymoon period
PoliticalDiscussion,Been waiting a while to say this   username check out You do have a valid point but I still like my rainy day fund theory because I think the panic may linger long after Covid due to the economic effects 
PoliticalDiscussion,If only we had something like a global pandemic team at the CDC to deliver this sort of advice     oh wait     
PoliticalDiscussion,       Have you ever been to the South 
PoliticalDiscussion,Normally In this case GM had originally agreed but FEMA had raised concerns that the cost they were asking for was prohibitively expensive so the government stepped in and said  no you re going to make as many as you can and we ll pay you a sane price  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But how many of each   There was a government report years ago saying worst case scenario we would need   ventilators   in a  level crisis   There used to be people in the government whose entire jobs were focused around preparing for disease outbreaks Then trump fired them We can still look at the reports they created before they lost their jobs

PoliticalDiscussion,The goal of the Defense Act is to redirect private resources to the public good We don t have enough ventilators and protective equipment By forcing private companies to produce more we could at least try our hardest rather than hope for the best 
PoliticalDiscussion,Without background information we have no idea of this is reasonable I could say they should make  million missiles to fight some enemy to fight a bunch of drones Do you think we could get GM to make them  Reality is that things are so much more complicated than WW They also ramped up over years to make those items 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why Florida  R  It s been a swing state for decades now is there any reason for it to become solidly republican 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Granted I think we both agree they re not doing this all out of good will  Completely agree   It s not like GMs going to be selling many new cars this year  And I m not going to rush out for that new vacuum cleaner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even with the hardcore Mormon religious base I m not from Utah so correct me if I m wrong but Trump won the state by a significant margin and Mormons tend to have a lot of kids  even the normal non polygamous ones so wouldn t Utah be able to maintain a consistently red voter base 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean that s kinda the whole point of the DPA  Companies don t want to take risks because they need to make a profit  The government steps in and orders them to make the goods and then the government is responsible to bail them out if it harms the company 
PoliticalDiscussion,Has been since   at least possibly even since the world wars or earlier  Kind of a fuzzy line  Never forget Hitler was Democratically elected and very popular 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess it changed yesterday   GM came back with a quote for bn and the administration is now forcing them to do it at  cost 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly the short term loans to firms isn t what s indicative of plainly being in the interest of corporatists  Both of these things have to be done 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s more that Trump aimed his campaign directly at  union workers and the white working class in general while Hillary didn t really make them the focus of her campaign  IMO Biden could retake Michigan if he put in more effort than Hillary 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand and agree that we dropped the ball   DPA historically  Department of Defense issues capital in the form of interest free loans to cover scaling  My diluted point was that Aside from losing time companies don t take a financial hit in any way   There are funded by the govt for the needed production no out of pocket loss aside from  potential profit   GM wanted bn for between k k ventilators   now with DPA they have to do it at  cost so tbd I guess
PoliticalDiscussion,It s all very well and good to say  it s patriotic to question the government but at the same time the government has a responsibility  and must be trustworthy with that responsibility or  changed as soon as possible to make that the case to its people I consider it both counterproductive and counterfactual to effectively say that there aren t governments that can t be trusted to act in the people s interests just that the current crop of Republican  officials are falling far short of that standard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Another Schwarzenegger You d need a social policy libertarian  or flat out social liberal to have any change of winning the main urban areas and that may poison such a candidate in the redder parts of the state bordering Arizona Nevada and Oregon  That is the only way you could possibly elect a Republican statewide in California is if that Republican were as pro abortion and pro gay marriage as they were anti tax and anti regulation Lots of California Democrats and Independents don t like the way the state manages its finances but within  miles of the coast  of voters have at least accepted if not embraced social policies antithetical to Republican orthodoxy in the rest of the country

PoliticalDiscussion,Politico is my favorite Factual and non biased I also like BBC because it really doesnt have any stake in US politics but it tends to be bland  I put Fox and CNN together in the spectrum  on opposites of it of course  NBC is okay for the nightly news segment but I dislike their articles as they are just as bland as the BBC ones imo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just keep in mind we can have ten ventilators for capita but these aren t plug and play consumer devices  You need a doctor a nurse a respiratory therapist  RTs are godly in their clinical knowledge of the management of the ventilated patient  a clinical pharmacist a unit clerk and let s not forget that without the people down in sterile processing who clean parts or the housekeeping staff who clean the rooms between patients and keep the corridors and other public spaces clean and free of virus the hospital would grind to a halt just as surely as it would if the doctors and nurses and RTs all vanished  How to keep all those people healthy and able to work  PPE  Not that vents aren t important but they re just piles of parts without an extensive and highly trained team of medical professions to run them 
PoliticalDiscussion,We have done this at other dire times   The US is pretty resourceful  How many parts does a B bomber have Ford was making one an hour 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would agree with you I don t believe the numbers of actual active hate group members is terribly large The bigger issue I feel is the large number of people who for one reason or another expouse portions of that rhetoric online  consciously or not or associate with groups where a vocal minority are actual hateful people  Then inexplicably the majority either deny the existence of these hateful people in their social groups play them off as  jokes or just say it s a few bad apples Case in point Most Jordan Peterson fans aren t actually Nazis but somehow JP suspiciously attracts Nazis and then the community tolerates them quietly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I know One party is more with providing financial relief to citizens the other is more interested is providing financial and economic stability to industries   Don t get me wrong Both are very important But the citizens do come first

PoliticalDiscussion,Holding the bag in terms of a much lower price There s noting wrong with saying that companies won t make similar profits they would be able to on the market especially when we talk about reformatting specialized factories that weren t made for whatever they are being commanded to make You are misinterpreting my posts as sympathy for them or the lack of action taken by the administration 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt By February Reade learned that no assistance could be provided because Biden was a candidate for federal office and assisting a case against him Time s Up said could jeopardize the organization s nonprofit status Ruling out federal candidates marks as off limits any member of Congress running for reelection as well as President Donald Trump Ellen Aprill a professor of tax law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles said that Time s Up s analysis is too conservative and the group wouldn t be putting its tax exempt status at risk by taking a case involving a candidate for federal office as long as it followed its standard criteria for taking on cases  As a legal matter if the group is clear regarding the criteria used as to whom it is taking to court show that these are long established neutral criteria and they are being applied to individuals completely independent of their running for office it would not be a violation of tax law Groups are allowed to continue to do what they have always done  she said The public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker whose managing director Anita Dunn is the top adviser to Biden s presidential campaign A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment The SKDK spokesperson assigned to Time s Up referred questions back to the NWLC     Few details I forgot but yeah Anita Dunn is the Chair of the PR firm that works for Times Up That is a huge conflict of interest 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Our Democracy Justice Democrats and another progressive group ran  candidates for Congress in  Every single one lost   That s false   And at the end of the day the vast majority of us know that it s going to take work   gt The ACA doesn t get enough credit This is why progressives need to attack Congress before the presidency The fact Obama got anything passed was nothing short of a miracle I implore you to read about how it went down It was freaking nuts But most of the failure resides in Congress Everyone wants to blame Obama but so long as Congress is the way it is nothing will change You think a Bernie presidency will change that  I mean it doesn t change the fact that it s a Republican healthcare bill But I think Obama could have twisted hands more and been more aggressive to get more than Since he was elected president he was the mandate of the party and he could have used that to his advantage    gt I ve been hearing for decades that the Liberal youth is going to change the electorate In  they elected a Republican Congress and President  Here s the thing though The youth back then didn t have the internet We do now today and we know that we re the only first world country without single payer and we re one of three countries to not have PTO We know we need to end the drug war And we re not turned off by words like a socialist We re less likely to listen to MSM  partially because we don t have TV subscriptions anymore and are more likely to listen to more independent  I don t want to use the word  fringe cause that does a disservice outlets And once again Bernie has won among people  and since he has won some states still including California there is an appetite for this stuff in the country  But I think the most convincing argument is this    Medicare for All has won in every Democratic primary That s thanks to Bernie Sanders He s made it a national talking point  I could be wrong in all this but if the Democrats want secure the next base of voters when the old base dies out it s going to have to move left 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s crazy to keep this in mind  For a lot of basic equipment for the US military such as uniforms weapons etc All of that needs to be made in the US  The fact that we have outsourced so much of the supply chain of medical supplies to foreign nations that aren t even on the same side of the planet much less our largest global adversary is just down right asinine  It s obviously biting us in the ass now and China controls the whole supply chain of medical supplies and equipment They were even calling supplies back from all over the world when the outbreak started

PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  During World War II that s basically what the US had for strategic resources  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh you re cool Sorry if you thought I was calling you out This was going to be a topic here sometime soon and unfortunately it brings out some of the same bunch trying to give this traction elsewhere  As for political consequences it s really hard to say Wall to wall Covid news the economic consequences and Trump s horrible mismanagement is sucking up all the oxygen in the room Aside from Vox this doesn t seem to be getting a lot of attention from mainstream news beyond rehosted material Biden s team has responded and is okay with this claim which they totally refute being investigated 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gathering the experts is only the first step  He has to listen to their advice which will often conflict with his gut instinct or the advice from his political advisors  Remember that Trump thinks he knows everything and  often ignores experts in the best of times   And consider how petty he s being with governors who won t say what a great job he s doing  There is nothing too petty for him to lash out about  This leads him to make bad decisions just to spite people 
PoliticalDiscussion,In a crisis  Yes  Market forces are too slow to address a pandemic and anti price gouging laws prevent market forces from even coming entirely to bear on the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Meanwhile one party put non COVID concerns into their proposal   and so did the other  It seems that you re only acknowledging when the other team does wrong while you re ignoring when yours does 
PoliticalDiscussion,But that really is not all you need to know That meme is largely in a social media vaccum Besides it having no bearing on reality it also has no bearing on primary voting or general election polls clearly 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve read previously that American people do respond more to pointing out Trump and his family acting corruptly The campaign should focus on change but it still needs to underscore what we are changing away from

PoliticalDiscussion,The Bernie crowd is really making an effort all over Reddit and social media to make this  allegation stick to Biden They re wielding  believe all women like a cudgel to the point of absurdity like Gillibrand did with Al Franken They label anyone who questions these claims as a  rape apologist or  victim blaming much in the same way they went after anyone who disagreed with Sanders as a  neoliberal   It s blatantly obvious that their intentions are not shall we say genuine They ve developed such a vested interest that it s positively creepy  Reade s story has drastically changed since last year I know one of her big defenders wants everyone to believe otherwise but that s absolute bullshit You can bring up every little excuse you want but that doesn t make it any more true or any more convincing Her story has  evolved to be sure replete with excuses for every inconsistency  The Putin stuff and here deleted social media account which doesn t have a bearing on her claims is nonetheless pretty bizarre 
PoliticalDiscussion,So in other words the ideal scenario is a planned economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,That may work for large equipment but not PPE
PoliticalDiscussion,Fuck Bernie this is about Biden and if he assaulted a woman in the s Any other candidate that didn t rape someone will do just fine Sure you can argue with me on these standards if you want   gt The mainstream media hasn t picked it up because it s not vetted and the woman isn t credible  Is this serious Maybe there s some other news story taking up space Or maybe just maybe the mainstream media could be wrong I know it would be a first but it isn t impossible  I don t know what happened I don t know if this woman is telling the truth But I assume she isn t until after all of the allegations are scrutinised You re the one so attached to your favorite candidate that you ve already made up your mind that she s lying 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is assuming that the coronavirus doesn t come again next flu season and then the season after that Some experts are saying that this is just the new reality we re going to have to deal with Sure maybe we re gonna have vaccines for the next one but there s still a non zero mutation risk and not being prepared for a potential COVID in terms of having the equipment to deal with it is just negligent 
PoliticalDiscussion,A downside could be that it actually works and americans get better healthcare because of it People would then want better healthcare after the pandemic instead of just accepting the ridiculousness of getting charged thousands for using a doctor out of network even though they worked at an in network hospital 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hmm what s the best way to put this    In politics a sufficiently widely held perception can become reality in a hurry And I think a lot of people hold the perspective that this serious of an accusation if substantiated  would sink Joe Biden And there s the potential there for it to become a sort of self fulfilling statement  And that sort of process is what some people are trying to grasp onto right now   They don t seem to be super bothered about whether or not it  gets corroborated at all right now and that s an issue but it s a slightly different one 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He won the Michigan primary for one thing  He didn t just win it He blew it out of the water 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes it more credible Because you totally bought it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that s true but I think I read that the number has actually been increasing as of late
PoliticalDiscussion,That s irrelevant to the fact that in the last governor s race in Florida we easily could ve had Gillum as governor Obv he s not gonna run again but it was still a close race which means I don t think the states solidly red If a state was solidly red you d imagine the Republican would win by a large margin if not in a landslide whereas DeSantis didn t even win by a full percentage point

PoliticalDiscussion, gt You don t think the president has the ability to gather these experts  Are you saying Trump is gathering experts Because no that s not happening Trump isn t even  following the per exisitng pandemic plan    Trump pushes experts out whenever they disagree with him That s why his administration has given  jobs to  Kushner   and other  family members    Experts are to Trump what cops are to con men 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ya gotta do what ya gotta do
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not think the president has the ability to gather the experts because I haven t seen him exercise the team building leadership skills that is the foundation needed in a executive position Fortunately he is involved at such a high organizational level that there is already an institutional capacity of capable people in the room that can pick up the slack

PoliticalDiscussion, gt But the sad truth is that any male Democratic nominee this election cycle would have faced these kinds of allegations  Pete sorta had It was a Jacob Whorl or someone of his level spreading a rumor But these types of allegations are harder to pull off than you might think You have to have an actual person  and not just a rumor of a person  And then when the media tries to contact every single person that this person was ever in contact with they have be consistent And if they find something unflattering the media reports it   This is something Uber has been doing to their whistleblowers    gt and it s all too easy for someone with a strong political motivation to sink a prominent politician s career by way of a false allegation  Can you cite where this has verifiably happened There are cases where non powerful people were vindicated when an accuser s story has been turned out to be false But accusing anyone with the prominence of a federal politician and you re going to basically have your whole background upturned Even IF there was a case of a false accusation it probably wasn t  easy

PoliticalDiscussion,No it s not relevant to this at all The  trillion is to prevent mass layoffs from companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s   really hard to predict Like really really  really hard  You can t just say  demographics dictate Change X  because political parties aren t exactly static in terms of policy Realignment not a  flip or anything since we re already socially polarized but some sort of change is pretty much certain  One of the bigger wildcards of course is whether or not Donald Trump has a lasting political legacy Is he unique or did he establish a new blueprint for Republican presidential candidates in terms of populist rhetoric and all that 
PoliticalDiscussion,It has nothing to do with supporting sanders It s about misanthropy

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Intercept is the one who vetted the two people she told in  by the same journalist who broke the Kavanough story  In early July  after Judge Brett Kavanaugh was reported to be on Donald Trump s shortlist to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ford contacted both   The Washington Post  and her congresswoman Anna Eshoo          gt She went to Time sUP in January  Why not go earlier than that  The Intercept and Vox are not outlets you want to go to if you are making an accusation You go to NYT WaPo or New Yorker 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the two parties disagreed on what was needed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know the politics that make them came down hard on Franken and now try to wiggle their way out Nothing to do with the accusations were true or not  My concern is wasting the time reading on your insistence that it exonerated Franken Which it most certainly did not So you are not going to quote me the part that you thought exonerated Franken

PoliticalDiscussion,You clearly have not seen a factory in a while then    Source work in factory making car parts
PoliticalDiscussion,Fair enough thank you for your thourogh response 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well a huge part of the article is that when the dust settled almost everyone save Gillibrand regretted calling on him to resign   And yeah I think some major holes were blown in the stories For example she claimed he wrote the script with her in mind so they would kiss The problem is that the script had been written year prior So yeah kind of a big deal  But if you still believe your side is vindicated that s fine People have different standards 
PoliticalDiscussion,She hasn t changed any parts of her story because this is the first time she has talked about this People are just confusing one incident she talked about last year with the one she is talking about now  And Biden would absolutely she for defamation Any politician would if it made them look innocent of sexual assault 
PoliticalDiscussion,The list should have been drawn after HN and reasonable stockpiles should have been started   The comparison to war is apt The Pentagon has the lists and stockpiles for the many scenarios The pandemic team   What pandemic team 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a social worker and I m familiar with the level of support available for people seeking legal action against their rapists  And she had been talking to times up for sometime yet they stringed her along and didn t offer any real support all while being staffed by Biden campaign workers and taking money from the Biden campaign Which is so insidious if it turns out he is a sexual predator 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not going to try and convince you to vote for Biden I ve had about  million of those conversations on Reddit and I ve realized there are progressives and Bernie fans   If you re a progressive you ll work your ass off to get progressives elected to Congress so any Democratic president could actually get progressive policies delivered to his desk   If you re a Bernie fan you re a purist and there is no pleasing you And that s ok   Politics is muddy awful gray and there is a reason why Obama has a record of passing the most progressive policies in our generation and Bernie doesn t   It sucks I m sorry to say I stopped falling in love with politicians years ago Biden wasn t even in my top three and Obama disappointed me in a lot of ways  for different reasons than you    But I ve now seen the full damage Republicans can do I failed to vote in the  midterm I failed to donate to candidates over the years I failed to be more politically active   That s my fault So I m going to change and make amends Hell I got my wife to register to vote and convince her we should donate money  Do what you feel is right 
PoliticalDiscussion,I called your bluff and actually read the thing  skipping everything to do with Tweeden  You have to be some sort of super fan of his to read it as an exoneration of his behaviour For the majority of the cases it was a shrug  he is just friendly and goofy that way  For the other three that  were sexual assault it was nothing but a simple denial Can you point out what evidence was there that the accusation were false Especially the last one  that ended his career  where his defense was he was going for a hug Who the fuck surprise hug a co worker in the office Do you think she is so stupid she can t tell if the guy was going for a kiss  If You  really think that was an exoneration you should re evaluate how you feel entitled to touch other people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course maybe she dislikes Biden because he sexually assaulted her That s certainly a possibility as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,She could crush Bloomberg because he doesn t have a whole lot of influence on the Democratic party With Biden it s more of a  if you go for the King you better not miss    The reason why Warren didn t endorse Bernie in  was to influence Clinton s policies and she did Warren wants to keep her influence on Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I am harassing the people by asking them how they have already convinced themselves that this woman is lying  And your paranoia about Russia and Republicans doesn t have any relevance on this persons accusations None what so ever and it s truly disgusting that you think you can dismiss sexual assault allegations because you are worried about Russia Also why are you assuming that Biden would be a huge threat to Putin The civil wars in both Syria and Ukraine are slowly resolving and cannot easily be intervened in So what exactly would Biden do Try to overthrow Assad again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Jared will take care of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,   you aren t going to mention the   trillion dollar bailout that same free market just needed to stay solvent 
PoliticalDiscussion,A Leftist Forum I m visiting is pretty much refusing to vote for Biden over this now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for me if Biden was to vociferously advocate for MA I d probably vote for him without a second thought But that requires him to make it a priority issue of his campaign which he probably isn t   The other problem is a lot of us view Biden as a moderate Republican  His record on Medicare Medicaid Social Security doesn t help him  Nor does the bankruptcy bill he wrote that eliminated bankruptcy protections for college debt  His vote for the Iraq War  He didn t support gay marriage till  because that s when it became politically convenient for him  he voted to confirm Scalia and Clarence Thomas TBF the former he said he regretted it cause Scalia was so effective  Not to mention progressives look at Obama as a disappointment Failing to even get public option when he had a super majority in Congress and going from promising to get us out of Iraq to instead expanding military involvement Progressives are skeptical of rhetoric they want something more concrete It s perceived as the only reason to vote for him is because he has a D next to his name on the ballot 
PoliticalDiscussion,She could have went to many reputable news outlets  Unlike Trump Biden knows not to try sue for defamation  Especially if outlets can verify and confirm aspects of her story You don t need legal support to make an accusation   Also she has changed bits of her story over the year 
PoliticalDiscussion,I assume the hospitals can adequately sanitize them upon arrival like they are doing for them after each use once they are in service 
PoliticalDiscussion,Better yet   Volunteers
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Were there any allegations before  Are you talking about Tara s accusation because she only told  people one of which passed away  I responded to this elsewhere but long story short Biden has been vetted numerous times lived in public eye and has the entire Republican Party trying to take him down   No one has found him to be sexually deviant yet No affairs sexual harassment assault or anything of that nature   So I understand why people are giving him the benefit of the doubt 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the other thing here is that it would be very beneficial to Putin himself for this too be true That adds a whole other layer to the credibility questions
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders supporters would not be pushing this if they did not believe a corroborated account of sexual assault would derail Biden 
PoliticalDiscussion,She had multiple chances to seek legal action against the Vice President with zero legal support  Is that what you re saying  It wasn t until the me too movement where women could get support to come forward with these things 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry what points in the other direction That mainstream media isn t talking much about this That is how you re justifying call this woman a liar  I don t want this to be desperately true like you clearly want this to be false I want this to be taken seriously and looked into not swept under the rug 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  but it s happening at the perfect time for Biden s campaign  It s also much better now than say October Remember swift boat There s a reason Biden urged the media to look into this calling it their Duty    gt l that being said it seems odd that her story changed from touchy to full on sexual assault   Well no there were multiple incidents She revealed all but the Rape one in defence of Lucy Flores when Biden called her accusations politically motivated The revealed the rape one to Time s UP in January    gt Furthermore Obama s team vetted him for VP and they were notoriously meticulous about everyone they picked I find it hard to believe this would get past them  Were there any allegations before  Are you talking about Tara s accusation because she only told  people one of which passed away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Apparently Trump s administration is having difficulties with the negotiations which have been holding up production only deciding to use the act cause he s angry at the price or something Thing is I don t see how it s gonna change anything since GM was already gonna produce the product and apparently the price they re selling it for is actually pretty good 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Liz Warren and Pete Buttigieg accusations were comical and were clearly set up by Jacob wohl who is totally full of shit The fact that you re comparing those incidents to this is pretty telling  And again why are her views about Putin in any way relevant Maybe if she was a huge Trump supporter like Jacob Wohl is you could make a point  And you re clearly not sceptical you just don t believe her 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for your honestly   gt His record speaks for itself and all he s trying to do in that stunt is to capture votes nothing more  And this is the conundrum his campaign faces Progressives want him to reach out but he s called a phony if he does   It s a paradox and it doesn t make any sense in a way   And this is why some say he shouldn t even try 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt On the other hand victims of sexual assault often have conflicting stories And this happened a while ago And she did mention that there was more to the story when she initially made her accusations She didn t want to come out because of harassment So there s enough there to make it hard to be completely dismissive  She never changed her story There were several incidents with Joe Biden the inappropriate touching kissing and smelling then there s demanding that she be a server because she had nice legs and then there was the rape incident  She spoke of the first two when Lucy Flores accused Joe Biden of doing the same thing and Joe responded by calling her accusations  Politically motivated  She then revealed the third to Time sUp in January of this year Time sUp had also collaborated this It was in then in March that she went public She never said there was one incident where she was touched and then changed her story that in that same incident she was penetrated There were several incidents    gt This could not come at a worse time He s almost the presumptive democratic nominee  It s actually the best time so the media  if they ever do it can fully vet the claims They don t this will be brought up by right wing groups and probably the RNC in October and they probably prefer it to happen in October Remember the swift boat attacks If those came out early in the year there would have been time space to refute those claims There was a reason they waited until fall Not only did the Swift Boat attacks have an effect due to it being so close to the election but it took away valuable time away from the Democrats messaging time that should have been spent attacking Bush s horrible records was spent defending Kerry    gt Surely early on when there were other candidates that could beat him would ve been a better time   She first came to Lucy s defence in April  then sought out Time sUP in January of this year If the allegations are true it seems that the evaluating the  repercussions were a bigger factor than any sort of timing Regardless her life is never going to be the same    gt On the other hand maybe it s more politically savvy to ignore it   If the democrats ignore it the republican party sure isn t The democrats may not focus on Trump s allegations because of Biden s  which some may thing would prevent the RNC from going into Biden s  though they still might because Biden has a lot more video evidence and they can get pretty creative despite Trump having much worse allegations  but other left wing groups will go into Trump allegations So the RNC will need to defend against this most likely by going after Joe Biden s   We already saw this when Trump brought Clinton s accusers to one of the debates But lets say that in the very unlikely circumstance that the RNC does not go after Joe s allegations other right wing groups will Remember the  rumors of Pete s victims or Elizabeth Warren s male prostitute They never received media attention because they were bullshit but right wing groups still used them in small media markets and facebook and in swing districts which may have been effective because there was no overall media narrative to point out the bullshit   But these were just made up rumor people by Jacob Whorl or whoever Biden is being accused by an actual person who is confirmed to have worked for Joe Biden and also has  collaborators verified by the journalist who broke the Kavanaugh story   Guilty or not the best thing for Joe Biden is for the media to give this attention now before the right does in October and he knows this Him and his campaign have urged the media to look into this I believe he said it was their duty 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Rules for the not for me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope I voted for Sanders and in my view   Democrats are hypocrites who only adopt progressive causes when it suits them  in this case they are dumping MeToo since it s not convenient right now   Media is largely controlled by neoliberal globalist elites who will unconditionally support neoliberal globalist democrats  I m not even Sanders biggest fan  Tulsi was my    but I voted for him because if you piss off these groups you must be doing something right Anyways I m not gleeful about this situation I m actually pretty pissed about it Because it just further confirms those aforementioned points that I find no joy in knowing are true Biden s a reactionary globalist whose campaign is all about moving backwards into the Obama years where everything was apparently perfect so of  course he gets a pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t speak for all Sanders and Warren supporters but I simply don t trust Biden to follow through His record speaks for itself and all he s trying to do in that stunt is to capture votes nothing more I don t trust him to act on this 
PoliticalDiscussion,  Yeah everyone knows she was a Biden staffer already   gt There were several incidents with Joe Biden the inappropriate touching kissing and smelling then there s demanding that she be a server because she had nice legs and then there was the rape incident  This is of course a post that cheerfully ignores the directly contradiction to her own past statements that it was nothing sexual as well as the progressive increase of salaciousness from  nothing sexual to  raped in a hallway   If you don t think that s a story changing over time I don t know what to tell you   gt Journalists have also verified that she worked for Biden at the time of her accusations  I get that you re really eager to smear Biden because you re in DSA or whatever but this is  remarkably weak  No shit she worked for Biden Everyone knows this 
PoliticalDiscussion,more people   dis  approve of his performance than approve he s at   in the middle of a crisis that s fucking pathetic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately anyone who s been paying attention especially in the last  years knows the  effective answer to that question 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re equating the long form of the  New Yorker to Fox News Let me give you some highlights   gt I recently asked Gillibrand why she felt that Franken had to go She said  We had eight credible allegations and they had been corroborated in real time by the press corps  She acknowledged that she hadn t spoken to any accusers to assess their credibility but said  I had been a leader in this space of sexual harassment and assault and it was weighing on me   Again I really suggest you read the whole article It airs out everything Every single side of this issue   It does a great job 
PoliticalDiscussion,The party may be  or have been  but Trump definitely isn t  And the party  or at least the base has been moving away from free trade laissez faire capitalism for a while and this has accelerated under Trump  We re in a re alignment and the portion of labor that was hurt most by NAFTA seems like it will be in the Republican party That makes the traditional Republican economic philosophy untenable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whataboutism Trump s behavior has nothing to do with Biden And if you think right wing media doesn t have strategy on the most appropriate time to release dirt in their opponents you are delusional 
PoliticalDiscussion,So did anyone else Or did you forget how everyone acted when he imposed a travel ban on China super early on   Media and even the Who said its not needed And yet now most countries enacted a travel ban on their own citicens in their own country    A t of money is spend for individuals cooperation and the government response He urges Biotech to find cure and new cheap and easy testing The social distancing measures in the US were imposed even earlier in the curve than many European countries   Oh and some other countries don t even do that and didn t do that at all There is not even coherent data how much that s worth it Especially with most infections being within family and people living together   Other counties also want to reevaluate measures at eastern  All people do is fucking blame without admit hing they would ve done the same or an even worse job Hindsight is  Did you sold all your stocks in  early January and bet on a market crash Were you for  border lockdown like you have during war times Because that would ve prevented the spread All cases around the world started with travelers I remember the sentiment change From one extreme to the other like always  And for every measurement you need to make a cost benefit analysis That s also what reasonable virologist say And Fauci somehow does not think Trump botched this  death would be less than the expected death toll for Italy on a per capita basis   And when it comes to the blame game Do you blame the people who actually spread this virus Or do you blame any individual who didn t just decide by themselves to take measures to help against spreading it Blaming the government is easy sure    Oh and I when this is all over no one will care anymore No one will revisit the measures and have an alaysis what really worked well and what was probably to much What countries really did a bad or good job Just like everything else when the newscicle moved one 
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing about SS is that   everyone pays for the generation before them Boomers paid their whole working lives and then get to benefit from that That s not a flaw that s the whole point

PoliticalDiscussion,We can   Raise the eligibility age people are constantly living longer We ve already raised it more The best bet here is to define a number of years from life expectancy and set it based on that to be updated for each cohort    Remove the cap on payroll taxes currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners Remove this cap or if that s too much for people at the very least implement a more progressive bracket   Means testing benefits reducing the benefits for the highest earners with the most saved already can go a long way toward solvency Moreover this can be coupled with more generous benefits for lower income recipients   Expand what the Social Security Trust Fund is allowed to invest in right now SS is only allowed to invest in special issue Treasury bonds with interest rates about the same as  year T bills or about  per annum The Trust Fund could be made more like a conventional sovereign wealth fund and invest in conventional stocks and bonds to achieve higher returns The Norwegian Oil Fund for example has achieved an average annual return of   in the last  years Of course people would be worried about the higher risk this entails but this could be contained by limiting the amount the fund can invest in stocks  for example Norway s can only invest  in the stock market  regulating the levels of risk allowed in investment and regular external audits of the fund     Increase immigration immigrants are typically younger and can add to the long term solvency of the Trust Fund Currently we have about  or so new arrivals each year Significant increases in that say    or more  could be huge boons to our economic and our social welfare system 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have family who works in GM manufacturing Yes they are currently asking GM to manufacture at a loss They want to pay at cost of parts which doesn t even include cost of labor The federal government should pay enough to cover labor of the workers in the factories

PoliticalDiscussion,When we say the Federal Government borrows from the Social Security Trust Fund it isn t  borrowing in air quotes it is literally borrowing The Treasury and the Trust Fund are separate entities The Trust Fund is required to only invest its money in Treasury Bills which is where the borrowing comes from as money comes in they use that to purchase these bonds from the Treasury These bonds have interest and that interest is paid In fact they collect nearly  billion in interest each year   Simply paying back this money into the Trust Fund isn t going to do much for it s sustainability because we re not actually pilfering it  As to your rhetorical question of where the money for the CARES Act comes from if we assume current buyers of Treasury bills matches current holders  which isn t a good assumption but it s close enough and illustrative   billion will come from your typical American investors pensions banks etc  another  billion will come from abroad including foreign governments about  billion will come from the Federal Reserve though indirectly about  billion from state and local governments and about  billion will come from the federal government itself including the Social Security Trust Fund 
PoliticalDiscussion,   So what you re saying is without  government intervention into the market  people would be laid off in droves and the economy would collapse 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s why when people drop out they  suspend their campaign and can come back any to time You don t have to be actively campaigning like Bernie in that case 
PoliticalDiscussion,I suppose the big issue here is that it assumes the white house will have unbiased experts onboard whom the administration will listen to and would not try to use said powers for their own gain
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a basic duty of a modern goverment  It s easily sustainable with a few small changes  We will never get rid of it while the country exists so millennials too will enjoy it when they retire
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean the goverment figured it out for tanks fighter jets and aircraft carriers pretty fast I dont thing medical ventilators will cause a gridlock and we dont have the time to wait and see the how market responds to demand People are dying now 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the federal government would stop  borrowing from the Social Security fund it would be more than capable of providing SS checks to all those retiring for decades  The presumption that there is less money being put into the system is false   At this point in time there are more people working and putting money into the SS system than ever before  Way more people paying in than are retiring  Here s a question where do you think they are getting the money for the Covid stimulus package  Not from the military budget  And they aren t going to just print more money to create an inflationary recession  It has to come from somewhere

PoliticalDiscussion,I could understand forcing them to manufacture at cost   Interesting that this is coming from the party ideologically opposed to big government and regulation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obviously there are different types A car factory would be reasonably dirty  A food or cosmetics factory would already be pretty clean 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Oh it makes absolute sense that this story is being pushed harder by Bernie Sanders supporters instead of right wing media   gt  gt I completely forgot that Biden hasn t been attacked at all by Republicans and President Trump during this primary My mistake  What make s  u  claim even more absurd is that Trump literally withheld aid from Ukraine in order to pressure them into manufacturing dirt on Joe Biden s son 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right But we don t know what that cost is and how it compares to what they re getting paid for them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does the market charge efficient rates tho I feel like value gets distorted because of consumer and distributor ignorance deception or various geographic restrictions at least you would think companies wouldn t go out of business or have wildly varying profit margins if markets were always right lol  Also how is price gouging equivalent to market rates anyways Lmao the whole issue with it is that it isn t you think these clowns buying out stores supplies of hand sanitizer and toilet paper then selling them at x the price are charging  market rates  Lmfao

PoliticalDiscussion,Russian cronies for Trump hard at work on social media platforms 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have more of an idea than you do We are using travel vents on icu patients because we ran out of vents already and it s not even peaked here So yeah we need more vents and not in a few years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obviously it would be more expensive per unit for GM to figure out how to manufacture a ventilator potentially source new materials and retool a factory than it would be for an existing manufacturer 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you were following the news you d be aware of what his justice department would currently like to do
PoliticalDiscussion,The people in charge have proven themselves exhaustively to be inept and out of their depth so I don t think  because they say it isn t isn t the best argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,Warren supporters may be voting for Biden But if she s on the ticket they re not just voting for Biden they re enthusiastic They re talking to their friends and neighbours they re volunteering there are knocking on doors  I appreciate that you and the people in your bubble have a good idea about what I would take to get really enthusiastic about voting for Biden I believe you But what I see from the Ride or die Bernie crowd is nowhere near as reasonable as what you are presenting Biden could get down on his knees on the convention floor and suck Bernie s cock It would not be enough for them I watched it happen in  Any awesome policies that HRC took on board or came up with had reactions like  she doesn t really mean it she s just saying that to trick us into supporting her  For example I had to tell you guys that she was literally the complainant in Citizens United and no one had more reason than her to see it overturned Your brothers just spewed nonsense about how she doesn t really mean what she says when she came out with an aggressive policy on campaign finance And that toxic attitude did contribute to her electoral college loss I m not laying it at their feet but people on the left spreading lies about the campaigns very earnest policy proposals is definitively am own goal  I never hear a satisfactory answer about how we re meant to get all this done if the left keeps losing elections It seems to me that the more we lose the more the left descends into a sunken cost fallacy  We ll pay for for years of Trump and that will bring on the revolution  they said Now as we warned the Supreme Court is lost making future changes prohibitively difficult And I m hearing the same thing again  I need to be wooed or  years of Trump will surely bring us the revolution   The US is descending into a right wing dystopia and instead of doing whatever you can to hold the line you re going to sit back and watch because     I don t know if you re going to support Biden I m not interested in convincing you that you should If your are You re not getting a pat on the back and a thanks Because your support for Biden is your only option at this point to further your own interest You re not going to vote for Biden as a favor to literally anyone but yourself It s what you need to do if you actually care about a single one of those issues you listed They happen when you shift the overton window The window shifts if you and your people vote in every single election for the viable candidate that most closely represents your vision   Last I ll put it to you this way If the tables were turned and Bernie was whooping Biden as bad as Biden has been whooping Bernie what do you think he d adopt from Biden s platform to his What conversations would you be having in your bubble about how you re going to reach out to Biden s voters what you re willing to give away or take on board to compromise and expand your tent Be honest You know Bernie wouldn t compromise on an inch of his platform and you and your friends would praise him for it  I genuinely hope Biden gives very little of his platform to your faction if for no other reason than to not make incentive for the disgusting behavior exhibited by your fellow supporters  I should be clear you seem awesome but you have some very bad company  Biden s platform would take things in a great direction as is You can t actually expect much more unless COVID kills half of all Republican voters and the makeup of Congress dramatically changes As it stands the next Democratic President will probably have to work with Mitch McConnell You know how much of Bernie s platform he lets through None of it Kind of silly to be demanding those concessions in grand scheme of things Biden has already been part of an administration that tried closing Guantanamo Bay  It did not go well     So yeah Vote in your own interest or don t I m not too personally invested I ll be fine probably I want to see the less fortunate improve their situation the vulnerable protected That starts with the Biden presidency I m disappointed that you and your friends are such staggeringly unreliable allies in that goal but me and those like me are just going to make do with moderates by sounds of things That will mean more concessions to the right unfortunately but I believe that the perfect is not the enemy of the good I trust the moderates more than I trust the Bernie wing to deliver results I imagine Biden may have similar feelings  Also you really need to explain to your friends how important it is to be respectful and reasonable like you seem to be Bernie s stunning loss this primary season is fault of all of them all of them as much as it is Bernie himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve frequently said I wanted to immigrate to NZ just so I could vote for Ardern  Stay healthy long distance friend
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  What are democratic supporters even supposed to do They ve set themselves up to always believe women and criticize republicans about their members poor actions  e g Trump and his accusers  To the point that they really jumped the gun on Franken which some people now say they regret It s poor optics to not take this seriously Not to mention how many people will be put off by voting for someone they think is a rapist Republicans tend to fall in line and even then they had problems with Trump  I think if the Kavanaugh scandal didnt happen this would be a more minor issue It s going to be pretty interesting how Joe Biden gets out of this I am guessing the issue will be mostly ignored unless some media outlets make it an issue Trump might be an asshole but at least there arent   videos  of him inappropriately touching women Joe Biden is basically known to touch women so at the very least the story cant be simply written off   I tend to hold people that tried to make this an issue for both Trump and Kavanaugh at a much higher standard than the other way around Similar logic would be used against people that are supposed to do something against abusers but actually end up being the abusers themselves I wouldn t be surprised it happens but I would be even more pissed than if they were random people

PoliticalDiscussion, gt  market prices in a crisis like this are morally reprehensible  My son and a large team are producing PPE on lasers and D printers They will produce thousands virtually at cost Different society different motivations  New Zealand is handling this with dignity  compassion and community spirit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good points 
PoliticalDiscussion,My understanding of capitalist profit driven multiple businesses in multiple layers all cooperating and competing out of self interest vs centralised state run decision making is that the former wins easily when it comes to production output The US out boomed the hell out of the USSR winning the cold war through economics  I ve heard my share of pro socialism and pro communism arguments and they ve all be grounded in concepts of fairness They re ethical arguments People not deserving more than others Wage slavery Generational wealth creating entrenched classes That sort of thing  Not once have I heard someone argue against private control of the means of production because they think government is better at smashing out widgets than private enterprise is Hell I ve heard plenty of arguments against  mass consumption tied in to pro socialism arguments which is sort of an admission that there would be less  mass production but that s ok because now we don t have masters  So in a time of shortage of widgets it seems to me like raw capitalism is what you want to turn to in order to get the job done Don t worry about quotas or government officials trying to wrap their heads around supply chains that others are already intimately familiar with Just chuck up purchase orders at rates that encourage retooling at haste and let greed do its thing Maybe make some government resources available with enough authority to expedite things through government red tape Month long wait to have your permit to produce a certain widget at a certain location looked at is reduced to same day turn around or your factory that had to close at pm due to noise ordinances can run   if its COVID related That sort of thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,By underdog we mean the woman Jesus   Dear Leader huh another communist schtick 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty sure that s sarcasm
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a bit funny on how people are demanding the government to step in While not long ago people likened him as a dictator wannabe with how he likes to cozy up to other dictators In that sense it is actually respectable that he is showing restraint on exercising his powers People could chalk this up as him not having the confidence to use it but I dont really care because it kind of blows that narrative out of the park 
PoliticalDiscussion,And people in those hospitals could very well be asking for things that are actually bad for them if they aren t asking for products that have met testing standards Them asking for home sewn mask doesn t mean it s a good idea to give it to them I can t speak as much on whether those are actually a safe idea beyond they haven t met testing standards so it s very likely they could be worse d printing falls much more in my territory and I know a lot people are printing things that are worse then nothing   For example while I might trust the best surgeon in the world on anything related to surgery in their speciality and trust them nearly as much on general surgical procedures I m not going to trust them to know what a good substitute is for their current face mask That surgeon is not an expert on material design selection and fabrication You can very easily produce a face mask that looks very similar to a medical grade one that the surgeon will be thoroughly convinced is the same when it s not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conversely though all the medical professionals in the world can t put someone on a ventilator that they don t have Workloads for staff are somewhat flexible in a crisis and while imperfect crash courses have certainly occurred in war footings before You can t train someone to do something without the tools to do that thing though and when the economy is losing trillions worldwide making and not needing a few hundred thousand extra ventilators isn t the end of the world  Honestly I think the DPA is unneeded though A directive to purchase the next X at whatever market rate would be ample 
PoliticalDiscussion,The hospitals are asking for masks Nobody is saying  Im gonna sew some Just for fun    They are begging for donations 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why did GM promise  ventilators for April  
PoliticalDiscussion,That man was personal scandal free which is saying something 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re missing my point State control really only works when they have all the information that private corporations have and can therefore direct production to maximize output No one has that information because we re actually in unprecedented times Today there are only best guesses about how to make all the ventilators we need but we learn more every day  And I m not talking about Ford and GM My biggest concern is the niche supplier refining the ore and materials to medical grade specifications that these machines need We all want the government to step in and say  GM produce   ventilators starting tomorrow  but then before you know it you ve co opted  factories and their batches are stalled at  completion because the upstream suppliers are spreading their materials too thin and can t meet demand In this scenario no ventilators get made because you ve stressed a vital bottleneck you didn t know existed because the system wasn t designed for this  If you really want the state to take control of the production process you need to observe trial and error across the entire market for a scaling up sizable number of batches first then go with the options and variables that will maximize production Which is why I would very much wait to see how this scales  before the government stepping in and does a manual override on the firehose  By all means when all these variables are figured out Uncle Sam can step in and throw as much money as he wants at it They will be able to produce more in the long term than they will stepping in tomorrow and trying to figure it out 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d be suspicious of that claim unless GM is sitting on a stock of  ventilators they haven t been telling everybody about There s a big difference between starting immediately and delivering immediately 
PoliticalDiscussion,No idea actually GM and the HHS Secretary would know those details That s a good question though and what happens if that is the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,She did change her story  Read her claim   as it appeared in April  Back then Reade described a few occasions where Biden allegedly put his hand on her shoulder or his finger on her neck and per the article  Reade said she didn t consider the acts toward her sexualization  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Doesn t DPA give the federal government the ability to order changes in production AND the ability to dictate what manufacturers will receive as revenues for what the government orders them to produce  No that would be a violation of the th amendment Takings clause The government can t force businesses to lose money or operate at a loss they can just dictate the manufacture of some specific good  DPA doesn t reduce any costs   gt Not to mention the bad press factory owners would receive  It all depends  Any business can make the case that they want to help but that the government is mismanaging things and stealing from the workers  Fascism isn t popular no matter how noble the cause   gt Re ROI nationalizing industry doesn t change the ROI but it DOES mean factories operate at a loss  Again the government can t do this even with the DPA it would violate the Takings Clause 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The way things are right now companies are coming forward having done their due diligence to talk about what they can realistically deliver in output with all these things combined  This is the main reason for state direction of production It s not about what companies can  profitably produce It s about what the fabric of society needs to be maintained which is beyond the event horizon of a private for profit entity Supply chain miscalculations come second place to existential threats to our way of life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah exactly They will do that to the point that it s profitable not to the point that s required It s like FDR after Pearl Harbor going to Ford asking  Gee do you think you could make us some tanks   If you don t I might impotently rage tweet at you but you and I both know I won t do anything that might negatively affect short term stock prices  
PoliticalDiscussion,She said she wasn t ready to talk about it She  also said that she was harassed by people online when she went public about the neck touching thing  Is that why she wasn t ready to talk about it I do not know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does that force them to manufacture at a loss 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s probably better to have a rainy day fund that can be flexible and adapted to provide for the circumstances than a bunch of stuff gathering dust and going obsolete 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The GOP bill had the  checks to people earning  lt k Pelosi was against direct payments originally  Neither of those things are true 
PoliticalDiscussion,We have sterililization units in most hospitals but not for a majority of our equipment Lots of this stuff is one patient set up you just discard it because it is a breeding ground for so many different types of bacteria and crud in addition to just regularly breaking down between uses Ventilators and especially these patients with their long term and heavy vent requirements are complex machines Like insanely complex And we need more than just one part to come sterilized and ready to work Auto pressure adjustment flow control air oxygen ratio distributions inline suctioning and whole bunch more of stuff goes into this In addition to the convenience of pre packaged goods it s also guaranteed to be sterile or clean inside of it s packaging Because you pray if something happens in sterile distribution because it occasionally does 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Dealing with pandemics is expensive Nationalizing industry isn t going to change that  Doesn t DPA give the federal government the ability to order changes in production AND the ability to dictate what manufacturers will receive as revenues for what the government orders them to produce If so not necessarily so expensive Also private industry might not work as quickly as would be desirable DPA allows the federal government to CEASE current production and leave the private sector manufacturer the choice between producing what the federal government orders it to produce or idle their factory Re that latter isn t there provision in the DPA for the federal government actually to take over idle factories for required emergency production  IOW yes indeed federal control through DPA can make factories change whether those factories owners want to change or not Not to mention the bad press factory owners would receive and I gotta say if GM put up serious resistance to DPA federal government control both Trump and Democrats calling them out would likely adversely affect Chevy Buick Caddy and GMC vehicle sales after the crisis ends Would GM be prepared to be the most reviled vehicle maker in the US  Re ROI nationalizing industry doesn t change the ROI but it DOES mean factories operate at a loss Not unlikely the federal government eventually makes up for the loss but production during the crisis WILL PROCEED whether factory owners want it or not Very much like drafted soldiers and sailors following orders they d prefer not to  In an emergency the main constraint it TIME If retooling existing factories would take less time than building new production capacity then EXISTING capacity will be retooled and factory owners can choose whether or not to build new capacity to manufacture what they HAD BEEN MANUFACTURING at the factories which had been converted to medical equipment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Their stuff in Brazil has been pretty important in taking the government to task there and has directly put Greenwood s life in danger And they are critical of the US to be sure but the US also deserves intense scrutiny for a lot of the shit it does I haven t read it s Venezuela stuff so I won t comment there 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is of course a post that cheerfully ignores the directly contradiction to her own past statements that it was nothing sexual as well as the progressive increase of salaciousness from  nothing sexual to  touched inappropriately to  raped in a hallway over the years For reference nothing sexual is a pretty absolute statement If you don t think that s a story changing over time I don t know what to tell you because you re pretty clearly in a place beyond reasonable commentary  She s referring to seperate incidents no  Not i my that but didn t she also say she was going to say more about Biden but backed off because of fear of harassment
PoliticalDiscussion,Cynic here wanna bet Oklahoma won t accept tribal IDs as acceptable photo IDs for voting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Re Florida lots of transplants from other parts of the country with their own grandkids in other states wanting LOW taxes and not giving a damn about Florida schools And they vote in very high  s Perfect Republican storm 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Most of the time that makes sense and optimizes resources Just not during pandemics  Why not during pandemics  If your argument is that people will need to pay more for to have large short term quantities of ventilators and PPE produced in a short timespan yes that s how supply and demand work  Dealing with pandemics is expensive  Nationalizing industry isn t going to change that   gt Left on its own the private sector would focus on the negative ROI rather than expected mortality rates  Again nationalizing an industry doesn t change that  The costs will still be the same Nothing you ve said justifies nationalizing industry vs using the standard government appropriations process to order large quantities from vendors voluntarily    The government is completely capable of ordering large quantities of PPE or ventilators  for a significant markup from the private sector  The private sector would be happy to supply large quantities adding capacity and retooling if the government is willing to pay  In fact nationalizing random companies and having the government oversee production is likely to be  less efficient than simply procuring those same resources on the open market 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe it was no act Maybe Bevin is a POS in human form 
PoliticalDiscussion,The virus has spread pretty far and there has been reported evidence of it reaching rural areas The problem with those areas is that their hospitals are very ill equipped alot of them not having more than a few ventilators on stock so when it hits it hits hard 
PoliticalDiscussion,In what way is he not doing a bad job He downplayed the crisis early on despite warnings He bungled testing early on and apparently withheld testing because he didn t want the numbers to go up he s failing to supply states with the needed supplies and downplaying their need while picking fights with the governors who actually seem to be leading this crisis in the absence of federal leadership And the idiot thought he could just reopen the economy by Easter or quarantine entire states willy nilly too while bragging about the ratings he gets cause nothing else matters to him And this doesn t even go into the economic problems which Americans will face down the road Fact is the reason why people like Fauci are predicting K deaths is because of the fact that Trump botched this incredibly in more ways than one 
PoliticalDiscussion,This could make sense on the surface via common sense but I would hazard to believe you without a study 
PoliticalDiscussion,The market is too slow because you re not going to allow them to charge market rates but you re perfectly happy to vilify them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The DPA means the government compels you to produce something and ultimately decides what you ll be paid to do it  In much the same way as Korean War conscription compelled Willie Mays to serve in the US Army rather than play baseball in for most of the  season and all of the  season And Mays had to accept Army pay too DPA is basically the draft for factories  Re PPE I figure one problem could be availability of the needed materials to produce them To the extent they require specially processed paper and to the extent US paper producers capacity may already have been nearly fully used major increases in such paper may require increasing capacity If so that won t be quick or cheap 
PoliticalDiscussion,You must have missed the part where the market is too slow under even ideal conditions  There s also the small matter that  market prices in a crisis like this are morally reprehensible 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean they actually can Improperly made equipment can be far worse then no equipment You can go from having short term contact  no equipment to having the device keeping you safe be a breeding ground for the virus The idea that something is better then nothing is dangerous There are places where we can lower standards like with the expired mask but even that s only after they ve been tested It also helps that the makers knew what they were doing so we at least know a lot of the basics will be fine 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If there is a need for ventilators the market is completely capable of doing that  Only when manufacturers get paid what they want If they can make more money manufacturing other things e g  robot vaccum cleaners manufacturers will make what makes them more money  Most of the time that makes sense and optimizes resources Just not during pandemics  When it comes to making more PPE to the extent that requires more specially produced paper then if US paper manufacturers capable of making that sort of paper were already operating near capacity then increased production would require ADDING CAPACITY rather than retooling mechanical factory floors Adding capacity for a chemically intensive process like producing specialty paper won t be quick but it will be expensive Left on its own the private sector would focus on the negative ROI rather than expected mortality rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,No GM lowered the number that they said they could make  profitably so he forced them to make them anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,And a lot of those people are potentially doing far more harm then good Doing something here can very easily be worse then doing nothing   It s like all of these people with D printers wanting to help It s nice to people willing to but the best thing they can do is not print them There are a lot of things that need to be done correctly to make even the basic stuff in a way that isn t worse then nothing   It s not just about profit it s about understanding that medical devices have very strict regulations for a reason You can be great at making highly advanced computer parts but completely unqualified to make even the lowest class of medical devices because there are very basic things that you won t think matter but do There are considerations that go beyond the typical quality standardization and sometimes sterilization standards of other industries 
PoliticalDiscussion, this   has to be a troll
PoliticalDiscussion,From another commenter   gt I also found threadworms and liver flukes in my toilet bowl once I started urine fasting  Hey uhh   not here to shit on you or anything but this part concerns me You can keep drinking urine all you want I doubt you ll be able to do any serious harm to yourself doing it But if you found parasites in the toilet they re unlikely to go away on their own  If you re experiencing any symptoms of a parasitic infection such as diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain or tenderness bloating or unexplained weight loss  then you should see a doctor once lockdown is over to test for parasites and get antiparasitic medication If you re in the UK pinworm infection is very common and the medicine is just one dose available OTC at any pharmacy  If you experience any serious symptoms like vomiting daily fever blood or mucus in stool or extremely fatigued or dehydrated  then you should see a doctor immediately  Just take caution going out during this pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,In theory the private sector should be able to respond more nimbly than government bureaucrats In reality the more     there is the faster the private sector responds Thus if there s little   the private sector can be slower than the slowest DMV  The simplest explanation is always money  If the federal government were doing the best job it could there d be a federal coordinator maintaining as public inventory of all ventilators in the US and there d be a mechanism for transferring them to where the need is greatest However if there are say  ventilators in total in the US and  people will need them by the end of this week a central inventory and coordination won t be much use  If we need more ventilators yesterday the question would be how quickly factories could be retooled to make them There s a real chance factories meant to make automobile engines could be retooled to make the motors for ventilators but the level of cleanliness needed for ventilators would likely be higher than for auto engines so initial factory cleaning followed by periodic cleaning protocols would likely be much stricter when producing ventilators meaning fewer hours per day fabricating new parts more hours cleaning the factory Also all factory workers would need some retraining about how to make ventilator parts and what circumstances should produce stopping production lines  What I m getting at is that even if the federal government were running every factory capable of producing ventilators the conversion would still take time and it d likely take more time if factory managers and government managers weren t getting along  As for PPE if masks require specially processed paper much higher production would require much more processed paper and if the paper producers had already been operating near full capacity much higher paper production would require building more capacity and that could take months because you really don t want slap dash capacity increase because the chemicals used in paper production are rather nasty 
PoliticalDiscussion,The US shouldn t have to rely on private companies to produce essential supplies like this    why don t we have some state companies that can mass produce these essential supplies in times of need so that the government doesn t have to go and order beg private companies to do it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The biggest downside is that it turns out we don t need them That s it The President has repeatedly said he doesn t think Coronavirus is as bad being predicted 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are we really relying on new truck manufacturing to enable delivery for supplies in  months What happens to the existing fleet of supply tracks in  months 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I won t believe anything she says But I will believe a sexual assault allegation that has already been corroborated with  people she talked about it with when it happened  Is that a ridiculous thing to believe to you Does that make you think I ll believe anything  Tell me exactly what you thing  believe all women means

PoliticalDiscussion,Buying into right wing propaganda mostly This whole  social security is insolvent nonsense is entirely an end run around the welfare state designed to make dismantling the social safety net sound palitable to the broader public The system certain could use tweaking but name me anything that runs flawlessly and without maintenance or adjustment for decades 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt SS was created to be a  supplement but seems to have replaced basic self reliant finances for various reasons  I believe to the contrary that SS is becoming more and more  supplemental as the cost of living continues to grow faster than average wages  We ve become a debt ridden society and with less property ownership SS won t be enough for many retirees in the upcoming decades 
PoliticalDiscussion,When you say that social security is redistributive do you mean that it pays more money out to those who have less If anything it seems to me to redistribute upwards because it continues to pay out and wealthier people live substantially longer than poorer people 
PoliticalDiscussion,How  We know explicitly redistributive programs are extremely unpopular with Americans  We have a long history of those failing and even when passed being reversed Making the Social Security program something that obviously hurts most Americans is not going to make it more popular 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s start with a base of are  workers for each retired person paying in  of wages  Then the retired people on average get  of one workers salary  Make is  workers per retired person and this drops to    Create a growing population so it is more like  per retired person and you can fund      There is a huge spread between  of salary and  of salary  rd what the average worker gets and   is big  But it is not impossible regardless of which scenario you are in 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt ok doesnt change the point that the top earners arent paying their fair share  I don t disagree
PoliticalDiscussion,I also work for a company that is making the reagents for testing kits  The ramp up is absolutely insane   The questions that I keep coming back to are two central points     Can non medical manufacturers actually safely manufacture the needed equipment and do so safely The standards are incredibly different for medical manufacturing Can a GM Tesla etc create a safe and effective product that is both sterile and effective    There second question is should we ask them  manufacturers to manufacture these products This isn t WW  The disease is  not an issue  months from now WW was a multi year multi nation effort This is not that it s an infection that spreads can be tracked and traced and has an end point very shortly after it starts  in relationship to WW    This request to ask and single out both GM  old school manufacturing and Tesla  brand new old school manufacturing smells of desperation to place this rapidly advancing disease on the same footing as a world war It creates buy in from the public that old manufacturing is going to ride in and save the day The older Americans see GM and they rejoice that the old man is back to work The younger kids see Tesla and they think advanced cutting edge technology will save the day    This sounds like optics not actual planning The pandering going on is significantly blatant and feels blatantly scripted

PoliticalDiscussion,Wow thank you for putting it like this In most cases I am all for lower earners receiving somewhat higher benefits but I had never thought about it in this light What if there was some middle ground like not including k s or IRAs in the calculations  This also raises the need to make savings and investing more available to lower income individuals as well as sound financial advice Providing a living wage would be a good first step there

PoliticalDiscussion, gt   Expand what the Social Security Trust Fund is allowed to invest in  This may have unintended consequences For example many attribute the current bubble in the corporate debt market to pension systems gorging on risky low grade IG bonds and levered products They do this because politicians underfund them and managers must take more risk to make up for the shortfall   In a low interest rate environment this in turn catalyzes corporations to issue more bonds buy back shares etc 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The primary problem seems to be that the elderly are requiring more social security than expected What is being brought into the system is also inherently less because that following generation is a smaller population   The primary population is simple and it has nothing to do with population It s the first thing you re mentioning With interest accounted for on average people are getting more out of it than they re paying in It s a money flow issue The only way to fix the money flow issue is to either reduce the money going out or increase the money going in   I personally would like to see a solution where more wealthy Boomers who are largely responsible for letting this issue slide while they profited from the extra cash on hand fund payments for those at the bottom I do not think the younger generations should be covering this if possible Preferably I would like to see the system reworked so that each person has an individual account where their money is deposited and people can see how much they actually have This will help the public have a better understanding of the funding so that they can hold their representatives more accountable 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Dear brother I apologize for not being a good orator I m working on it  gt   gt Sometimes because of being passionate this has happened However the same has reduced in the videos that were made after this one I m really working on it    ok doesnt change the point that the top earners arent paying their fair share
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Were it thought of that way it would be much less popular  This seems to be begging the question
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Raise the eligibility age people are constantly living longer We ve already raised it before The best bet here is to define a number of years from life expectancy and set it based on that to be updated for each cohort  Just because the average age before death increased doesnt mean they are good years What good is SS if you are bedridden or unable to do anything   gt Remove the cap on payroll taxes currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners Remove this cap or if that s too much for people at the very least implement a more progressive bracket  This fundamentally breaks SS and its role If you want to do this just scrap it entirely and provide welfare  which this would become without SSA overhead or rules Also the cap doesn t benefit the rich at all as there is a corresponding cap for payouts hence the cap on pay ins Maxed SS people already get the worst deal from SS as it stands with bend points   gt eans test benefits reducing the benefits for the highest earners with the most saved already can go a long way toward solvency Moreover this can be coupled with more generous benefits for lower income recipients  This also breaks what SS is If you want this just scrap the whole thing and give out generous welfare Why bother with  accounts or credits etc   gt Expand what the Social Security Trust Fund is allowed to invest in right now SS is only allowed to invest in special issue Treasury bonds with interest rates about the same as  year T bills or about  per annum The Trust Fund could be made more like a conventional sovereign wealth fund and invest in conventional stocks and bonds to achieve higher returns The Norwegian Oil Fund for example has achieved an average annual return of   in the last  years Of course people would be worried about the higher risk this entails but this could be contained by limiting the amount the fund can invest in stocks  for example Norway s can only invest  in the stock market  regulating the levels of risk allowed in investment and conducting regular external audits of the fund  And what happens when you have a downturn You are also cutting off how the government does a sideways transfer to itself which would require higher taxes   gt Increase immigration immigrants are typically younger and can add to the long term solvency of the Trust Fund Currently we have about  or so new arrivals each year Significant increases in that say    or more   could be huge boons to our economy and our social welfare system  This is just pyramid scheme thinking  how SS was built to begin with  The reason we have  problems now is because of this very mentality
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Raise the eligibility age  People are living longer but is there any evidence they are being productive longer  Will companies want to employ  year olds Will the youngsters want to wait another half decade to get their turn 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly Blow my cash on an expensive wedding for junior or a two month European vacation Why not Only way to get my max payout 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Will likely Until when  Until the bonds mature  Which is all under  years  Far more likely as was the case with TARP they get sold long before maturity  I suspect we are talking they hold for  years    gt  Gambling in futures seems like a great investment until it s not   That s a nothing statement  There are investment with high expected right rates of returns  The government is buying one of  those     gt  We don t control those markets as we re seeing right now with oil   I think we do control those  But that s a side point  Assume we didn t  Lots of people make money in investments without being able to control markets   gt There is never any debate on saving these corps It took Obama  days of fighting house senate for the corporate bailouts in   TARP passed under Bush not Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just fund the shortfall  projected to be from  to  of benefits from appropriations It s that easy  We do it for Medicare for the military for all sorts of stuff that represent a much larger amount  we don t expect any of those programs to raise as much in revenue as they spend in benefits And those programs are much more expensive than  of the GDP  total size of social security or  to   of GDP  projected shortfall  and actually have been growing faster than GDP  while SS is projected to stabilize as a fixed percentage of GDP after the baby boom generation with a fixed ratio of retirees to workers  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s my understanding that the insolvency of SS is caused by two main points folks are living longer lives following retirement than they were a generation or two ago and families are having fewer children now than they were a generation or two ago which means fewer folks paying into the program overall  Generally there isn t enough money going into the SS program to pay the benefits folks need We could be looking at increasing the age of retirement and increasing family size That means encouraging younger folks toward stability so that they are equipped to have children and feel secure enough to have multiple children We need to have more children than the number of parents in order to keep up and that is not what is happening Within two generations   As of  the U S Census Bureau counted about  million families in the United States The average family consisted of  persons in  down from  in the s This is reflected in the decrease of children in family households overall In  about  percent of all family households had children under the age of  living in the household This percentage declined to  percent in    URL    My partner and I certainly cannot afford to have more than one child and our one kiddo won t contribute enough in SS to cover both my partner and me through retirement to death  assuming the program doesn t collapse within the next  decades before we even access it  It certainly won t be around for our kiddo We are planning to have to have to retire if able without social security All families should be preparing for the same SS will fail and it is time for it to fail It s unsustainable by design 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think Joe would be impacted by it since we have Coronavirus It is worrisome though
PoliticalDiscussion,Requiring more In case you are unaware your need for benefits may impact Medicare not SS It s simple demographics on SS Title written by an imbecile 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That is called a Ponzi scheme and it is not sustainable  That s not a Ponzi Scheme  The difference between Social Security and a Ponzi Scheme is that people die and thus lose their asset base In a Ponzi Scheme you need ever increasing numbers of people Social Security would work  though the payout might decrease even with a declining population 
PoliticalDiscussion,People need food water shelter medicine What do you think we ll run out of Agricultural productivity keeps going up There s lots of land for housing We were doing OK on doctors until the recent pandemic Seriously what s in short supply that makes it difficult to support a population 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you think of Social Security as a trust fund then it is buying bonds just like private funds do  Yes that is borrowing but it is borrowing the same way the government borrows from JP Morgan Chase and Vanguard 
PoliticalDiscussion,I question the presumptions that SS  must be saved and that it s existence is a necessity  What of several systems existed before SS  Tontines and other insurance methods family savings others and how well did they work  SS was created to be a  supplement but seems to have replaced basic self reliant finances for various reasons  What are those reasons  social pressure tax laws belief structures and how have they improved or injured overall preparation for the future   Where do IRAs and Ks fit in all this  Does the government  laws support or suppress individual preparation for retirement and to what degree 
PoliticalDiscussion,Reduce the payout to  of current levels and apply the worst assumptions and Social Security is fine  There may be benefit cuts but they won t be to  
PoliticalDiscussion,Means tests for SS is so wrong   Paying taxes for a benefit that is all about a social net but once you hit the age that you can benefit you don t qualify because you made too much doesn t make sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,You mentioned this is all controversial  The problem with  on your list is it would make Social Security obviously extremely redistributive  Social Security is already quite redistributive but it is not thought of that way  The redistributive aspects are more subtle and thus most people don t realize how much it is doing   Were it thought of that way it would be much less popular  Do all of  and a majority of tax payers would see obviously how bad it were for them and turn against the program  Social Security works because there isn t a large constituency that thinks of it as harming them under  that would IMHO no longer be true  On point  I agree with you  Though I think we could do that more gradually  I d rather see a move to  where the benefits are incredible and the risk decreases  The move from  increases risk in exchange for increasing return  Might still be a very good idea but I think let s do the no brainer first   Point  I think could also be expanded with pro nativity policies  There is an immigrant backlash right now I agree that immigration is a huge economic win for the USA and the anti immigrant people are wrong  But  pro nativity would appeal to conservatives while immigration would not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there should be a true AMT  alternative minimum tax for higher earning  individuals  that doesn t creep into the Middle Class and corporations 
PoliticalDiscussion, Lockbox 
PoliticalDiscussion,   You know sometimes it s ok to just admit you have no idea what you re talking about   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is terrible to say but it s happening at the perfect time for Biden s campaign Covid is sucking the media attention dry  I saw a flash on this situation and it was buried and gone in a day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Public pensions should be for the poor Everyone else should fund their own retirement through mandatory private pension fund contributions
PoliticalDiscussion,Societies have supported their elderly for thousands of years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you saying we need a Social Security  lockbox  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re fucked wherever you go it s just the reality of you 
PoliticalDiscussion,SS is a garbage ponzi scheme that was good for an immediate fix to elderly poverty and when most people died shortly into retirement but in typical US fashion they left an old system in place regardless of how obsolete it got The system needs a major overhaul but in the end it needs to go  Increase the inheritance tax rate and lower its threshold to cover everyone in the upper class Funnel this increased revenue into SS  Lower SS payments to all the higher end recipients  Means test SS to trim down payments to those with high value assets We shouldn t be subsidising the inheritance of the middle class  Completely replace SS with a mandatory private pension fund system for younger workers and steadily close down SS as older people die Employers will pay a percentage of the workers income into their personal pension fund Low income workers who voluntarily pay into it will also get some copayments from the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe that is accurate but it changes what social security was designed to be It moves it more towards a pay as you go system and away from a fully funded system  Basically SS was more so meant to be forced retirement savings rather than a welfare program Eliminating the cap would would transition it from a being a mix to solely a welfare program  Whether that s a good or bad thing depends on what role you see it playing in society 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ppl act like it s a checkbook that is balanced still lolol modern monetary theory has nothing to do with this These arguments using standard economics is not even our situation   Also the corps get almost no interest loans then will do what with them Buy up the assets leftover at the end of this It s estimated  of small biz will close Who buys those assets The richest corps in America The entire bailout is a bailout for the richest ppl   a consolidation of wealth to the top again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t it  k for     
PoliticalDiscussion,Those are loans Bernie Bro
PoliticalDiscussion,It would help if Congress would stop stealing from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,rampant disease and pestilence that has a disproportionate impact on the elderly   good thing that won t ever happen oh wait   
PoliticalDiscussion,The federal government can create as many dollars as needed for this or any other reason There s no shortage of dollars just political will to care for citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,Will likely Until when Until it happens again then again And this is fine essentially with everyone over   over Gambling in futures seems like a great investment until it s not We don t control those markets as we re seeing right now with oil American shale is dying as we speak It s a gamble like always   There is never any debate on saving these corps It took Obama  days of fighting house senate for the corporate bailouts in  It took a weekend this time to produce a  page bill Gtfoh It s built in to the system now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I read  years  a bit old but see here for a congressional report on the matter   
PoliticalDiscussion,No I hate Bernie because he s an asshole and because he hires nothing but lickspittle assholes instead of competent people who actually care about running a campaign or government  I m not into  Berning it down because if the last three years demonstrate anything it should be that  that s a bad idea  
PoliticalDiscussion,Make SS a sovereign wealth fund and allow for more diverse investments   This literally is the only way 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Fed didn t just  dump  trillion into the market  You need to look up what is actually happening  start by looking up the repo market   It s just giving liquidity to ensure borrowing as far as I know and is borrowed not given 
PoliticalDiscussion,The money to corporations which is essentially buying stressed corporate bonds on leverage will likely turn a profit  Treasury is essentially buying something like a futures spread between LQD  corporate bond futures and  something like ZN  year future   At today s spreads that s likely profitable    Americans may get annoyed when the government acts like a hedge fund but the reality is this produces income for treasury it doesn t cost the government  And that s just from the investment raw not even counting the huge gains in tax revenue that the funding generates 
PoliticalDiscussion,new money is created by government spending and deleted by government taxation
PoliticalDiscussion,Is this serious You re aware those are loans right It sounds like you need to do a lot of basic research before you start talking about this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our government needs to enact a Absolute Minimum Corporate Tax Make every company pay taxes close all loopholes This will be even more important as automation replaces more workers   Then there will be enough money in the treasury to cover Social Security 
PoliticalDiscussion,remove the cap on SS deductions currently its capped at k yearly income  eliminating the capital gains tax and tax that as regular income would bring in a lot of money as well
PoliticalDiscussion,I am vehemently against some  most means tests especially the versions where a retiree is judged as not worthy of getting social security due to their prior year adjusted gross incomes  This can impact those taking income from their k s in retirement  While I understand the intent is to save social security dollars for those who need it more this means test punishes those who actually reduced their spending during their working years and saved for eventual retirement  And it rewards those who did no saving and banked that social security would always be there 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about the  trillion the fed also dumped into markets on top of the  trillion by the gov How do those TRILLIONS get paid back 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re aware that the bailout money will be paid back Deficits turn into debt which payments on represent roughly a quarter of the annual budget   Don t you think you should understand the most basic aspects of public budgets before you start on your angry rant 
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing about a Ponzi scheme is that if you have the authority to make every man woman and child in a country participate in it in perpetuity it will never collapse In fact the one thing that absolutely  will collapse Social Security would be to stop requiring people to pay into it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dark but true
PoliticalDiscussion,And poor people that never escape poverty now rely on the welfare system 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody asks how we pay for a  trillion dollar bailout Of which mostly all of it goes to corporations Why is that But ask about improving SS for the lowest income ppl in America and everyone has to balance it like it s a checkbook These are jokes If it was important to politicians it would be solved without a worry No doubt 
PoliticalDiscussion, rat turds  Not great not terrible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gradually get rid of it and have people save for their own retirement
PoliticalDiscussion,Or if they removed the limit one is allowed to contribute It would be solved if they lifted the   taxable income cap 
PoliticalDiscussion,When the person behind the Ponzi scheme controls the money supply it s not really a Ponzi scheme

PoliticalDiscussion,I read somewhere that if you remove the cap on payroll taxes it will pretty fund SS for decades  I am planning on never seeing one red cent but it sure would be nice if I did 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If the federal government would stop  borrowing from the Social Security fund  The SS fund does    and always has   invest its excess funds in treasury bonds What is your problem with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing can be done Society regardless of economic social system can t support a population with such a high percentage of nonproductive people The Wuhan virus eugenists see the writing on the wall 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Blasey Ford OR Roy Moore s accusers  Dr Ford testified under oath before congress her story was based on the credibility of her testimony  Moore s accusers were all vetted by WaPo not a sensationalist YouTuber  Do you not remember that guy who did the fake  selling baby parts video paid a woman to make up an allegation about Mueller  The Washington Post hilariously caught them   gt If Biden raped her why wouldn t she want Bernie to win  It puts her motivations into question since she has already tried to cause a stir in Biden s campaign in  re he touched her neck and she was uncomfortable  which probably did happen   Once that story didn t really catch on the claims became much more serious   gt If she loves Bernie so much that SHE WOULD LIE ABOUT AN ASSAULT why did she work for Warren  There is absolutely no truth to her working or even supporting Warren prior to these allegations  From her old tweets she started supporting Bernie immediately after switching after the self help author who uses crystals for deodorant dropped out  Which again being extremely inconsistent about certain details of the story does not make her seem very credible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly It s hard to believe they wouldn t find something else to justify not voting for Biden with half a year left in the general election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let the corona run it s course 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is very often one decision that is very seldom taken in reforms like these  Have a maximum pension one is allowed to recieve  Usually any politician who talks about this obvious and most efficient measure will be boed out of any power position becouse pensioners as a group are very influential and pensioners who recieve so little would still be upset becouse most often the news would go as if they were the ones to recieve less

PoliticalDiscussion, gt And at the end of the day the vast majority of us know that it s going to take work   In  Justice Democrats recruited  Democratic primary challengers and endorsed  other candidates The only Justice Democrats recruited candidate to win election to Congress that year was Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  D   This is form your source    Progressive s   strategy failed in   Here s   how they did in the midwest   If you care to read those articles you ll see that Progressives learned  nothing from those losses Instead they doubled down on their strategy and at this point can we really wonder why Bernie is getting absolutely clobbered in the primary   was the first warning sign for progressives  should ve been the definitive warning and now the  is another reminder of that reality    gt I mean it doesn t change the fact that it s a Republican healthcare bill But I think Obama could have twisted hands more and been more aggressive to get more than   One it s not a Republican bill Zero Republicans voted for it I understand where the idea came from and how it originated it but it was completely drawn up by Democrats   The latter part of your comment is where you and I kind of agree I think Obama was a good president but a terrible leader of the Democratic Party He didn t involve himself enough in the organization and let it fail   That being said Democrats have a geography problem About  states in the United States are Red or lean red This means the Senate will always have a right tilt even if Democrats have a majority   Obama wasn t going to twist Joe Manchin Jon Tester or another center left Democrat s arm Obama wasn t popular in their home states   And Bernie would run into this exact problem as well He can support MA all he wants but it s dead on arrival in Congress And if all it takes is a little cajoling why doesn t he simply do it now   gt The youth back then didn t have the internet We do now today and we know that we re the only first world country without single payer  Cool so when is it going to translate to votes  I saw your article about how progressives are now hanging their hats on how popular MA is amongst Democratic voters   I want to provide you a quote   gt The fourth proposal  expanding the Medicare program to cover all Americans  has support from  percent of respondents and is opposed by  percent  This article was published in       It s not that the internet is going to change the game it s creating an echo chamber if disenfranchisement that has always existed in politics   They youth that wants radical change runs into the brick wall of reality that most people don t want it   So instead I implore them to accept incremental change like Obamacare I get scoffed at and told I m a corporatist   The cycle is going to continue until we find a Democratic progressive cause that will unite the country and pierce the current political paradigm   It s not Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think he s got both locked down I think what he needs to focus on is suburban woman  which ironically enough Harris would probably get more of those voters than black voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Her seat would be filled by the Democratic governor of Wisconsin and then that seat wouldn t be up again until  I think she won t happen because Biden said he wants someone to largely agrees with him on the issues specifically on healthcare and that Baldwin has been a supporter of MA for a long time now

PoliticalDiscussion,Well I m  and in pretty good health but I sure don t have the stamina needed to run a hotel restaurant and banquet center anymore 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politicians have been borrowing from SS for decades which is why they are now trying to get out of paying people from the fund and have the audacity to label it as an entitlement They would rather steal the money and tell us we are trash for wanting our money 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well terms of voting that has some factors to it  For one voter suppression was a big thing since young people middle age work for a living so they can t just go out and vote like the elderly can If there was a special day where everyone can vote for their candidate in each level of political government certification with absolutely no worries then maybe there would ve been more substantial results  In terms of arms i think there is a negative stigma to it and that it should be required that young people learn about guns trained at around   Maybe we wouldn t have people that don t know everything about guns making erratic decisions on them that affect gun owners 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know how those two can be different Paper defines practice 
PoliticalDiscussion,What freeloaders Can you demonstrate that there are more freeloaders now than before

PoliticalDiscussion,How about the feds repay toe Regan era heavy borrowing    
PoliticalDiscussion,Just think of the income taxes your pay for your labor as an   idiot tax   because you only pay them if you haven t figured out how to make the world work for you rather than the other way around 
PoliticalDiscussion,What does that mean Sorry I m not too deep on social security policy issues
PoliticalDiscussion,Aren t corporate taxes generally considered a bad idea by economists You should be taxing things you want to discourage  business growth and job creation are not those things 
PoliticalDiscussion,It only needs to be increased by a year or  to have a significant impact
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What good is SS if you are bedridden or unable to do anything  The original  point of SS was to provide for the bedridden elderly not to provide two to three leisurely decades for active work capable adults starting at age   It s amusing that the boomers who hate  entitlements the most are now so keen on protecting a system that was never  supposed to be an entitlement but has become one over the last  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do we do for the people who don t save  Let them die in the streets does punish them but is not likely to go over well  Private charity might cover it but I d be surprised if it had as high a coverage rate as social security

PoliticalDiscussion,Treasury bonds are the safest investments out there People are climbing over themselves to buy them now   IOW they re the complete opposite of zero balance 
PoliticalDiscussion,The social security costs are rising because the purchasing power of the dollar are eroding The monies paid into social security are nowhere near enough to sustain it   If you want to stop dollar erosion we must switch from a keynesian economics framework to an austrian framework That means the US government needs to stop printing money   There are existing currencies that obey austrian mechanics For example both gold and bitcoin follow austrian mechanics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fuck social security I hope it collapses I shouldn t foot the bill for people who are either too dumb or ill equipped to save for retirement Now if I were to see every single dollar I put into it the day after I retire then I wouldn t mind it But in reality you d have to live to be over  years old to get all that money back So where does that money go once you die It definitely doesn t go to your next of kin who are entitled to it No it goes towards other government programs because it s another form of tax disguised as  retirement benefits 
PoliticalDiscussion,Removing capital gains tax is asinine I agree there  But that has nothing to do with IRAs  Pulling money out of your IRA is taxed as ordinary income 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt DOD s budget this fiscal year is about  billion roughly  of the GDP That s without the level of military operations we d seen since    DOD s budget is BN plus   BN for OCO     military spending   military spending     xB   gt In contrast Social Security retirement benefits are going to be approximately  billion this year   Not sure where you got that but Social Security is  T       Now about  of that is for disability  So even if you take that out you are still looking at T not  BN   
PoliticalDiscussion,End it entirely
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you suggesting that because the group as a whole is wealthy that every member of that group is wealthy Surely not  Because some human beings will always be irresponsible That s a fundamental part of being human If you aren t making policies to account for people s negative qualities as well as their positive qualities then you are just making bad policy 
PoliticalDiscussion,So people calculate how much they standard to earn and what effect that will have on the benefits they receive    For example I might look at my yearly earnings with a company and see that if I stayed with them for  more years I would receive  monthly income during retirement  If I left before  years I might only receive    Pretty good reason to stay on for  years     However if the  bumped me past the social security cut off for means testing I might lose  month in social security benefits  That would mean that it makes more sense for me to retire  years earlier since my net income would be  month whether or not I stayed on with the company 
PoliticalDiscussion,That reference sounds like he was describing Paul Ryan s views For the full two minutes prior he s explaining inequality and how taxes need to be raised on the rich to address this So sure we can argue about what he actually said but really  Like none of this makes him worse than Trump who is actually borrowing your money to help himself and the other billionaires and is bankrupting the nation to help people who don t need help Trump s budget every year attacks SS and Medicaid  And this is what Biden actually says now    Which he will be held to Even dishonest Trump tries to build the wall in his own lazy incompetent and corrupt way Biden has put his stake in the ground he s accepted money based on his positions and the Democratic Party won t accept any changes that help the rich and hurt the needy There s no real reason for skepticism and no where else to go anyway  If you re such a disappointed Bernie fan first which party was going to pass Bernie s changes over the conservative judiciary and filibustering Senate and Fox News Second who will Bernie vote for  We the people lose because the greedy maintain their loyaly even for the worse candidate in history We need to stick together and nitpicking individual comments in a Youtube video is quite simply counterproductive

PoliticalDiscussion, gt was the first warning sign for progressives  should ve been the definitive warning and now the  is another reminder of that reality  I disagree At the end of the day we re at a funding disadvantage We re not willing to accept big money from oil companies big pharma defense contractors etc It doesn t help that MSM isn t going to give us a fair shake    gt Cool so when is it going to translate to votes  It might take a while At the end of the day until we take advantage of the numbers we ll simply be outvoted by the boomer voters But I ve already told Bernie wins among people under  So it s not just the  youth  but it s rather Gen Xers and Millenials who clearly see this is necessary to happen    gt It s not that the internet is going to change the game it s creating an echo chamber of disenfranchisement that has always existed in politics  Maybe but I see it also as the great equalizer At the end of the day Millenials late Gen Xers and Gen Zers we re not going to have TV subscription so we re not going to hear from MSM as much We re going to hear from people in other countries how radical the American system is    gt hey youth that wants radical change runs into the brick wall of reality that most people don t want it  I don t think single payer is radical and I damn sure don t think most Americans especially among younger Americans view it that way   This may be anecdotal but whenever I see MSM talk about single payer and MA I don t always see them make the caveat that we re the only first world country to not have it But when I talk to people my age or a little bit older they see getting single payer as catching up to the rest of the world And there s nothing to change that fact because no country is stupid enough to switch to the American system And I think that s what going to happen with a bunch of issues because the current framing is simply going to fall out of date   gt So instead I implore them to accept incremental change like Obamacare I get scoffed at and told I m a corporatist  While I m sure you re not a corporatist I m sure you understand why they re frustrated Incrementalism still allowed millions to be left uninsured it expanded our military conflicts it failed to end the Drug War it failed to look out for the average American More importantly it turned a Democrat super majority into Republicans pretty much controlling every level of government Clearly the American people don t see incrementalism as much of a positive and to avoid another Trump GWB in the future we have to do a lot more   So maybe it s not Bernie right now But in the long run neither is it going to be incrementalism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keeping older people in the work force hurts younger generations job opportunities thus creating another set of cascading economic issues

PoliticalDiscussion,We re talking about people making solid six figures so hardly a  welfare trap  Obviously it s not great to disincentivize people from making more money  or more likely incentivize them to hide their income  but it s also pretty far from  won t somebody think of the poor millionaires   territory 
PoliticalDiscussion,DOD s budget this fiscal year is about  billion roughly  of the GDP That s without the level of military operations we d seen since    Now a substantial portion of that goes towards things like healthcare for servicemembers but that s still an important component of military readiness And DOD s budget doesn t include the VA s budget  which is also an important albeit indirect component of military readiness  In contrast Social Security retirement benefits are going to be approximately  billion this year 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mean   blunt but accurate coronavirus will help reduce the burden on SS and make the system more sustainable in its current state for awhile longer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you elaborate on that idea I ve never heard of a welfare trap before 
PoliticalDiscussion,bends points screw higher earners
PoliticalDiscussion,Then what s your plan for Senior Citizen poverty It would shoot up without Social Security 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no real moral hazard here because these people are retired  They were never going to be a significant part of the workforce anyway so they can t really decide to work  less to game these benefits  They can avoid withdrawing funds from private retirement accounts but we could easily add in a wealth test to catch these edge cases 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt lol then why is it the dems trying to do most of the proposed  solutions   Because they re good ideas on their own merits   gt its not nonsense Its direct from the SSA themselves Yes they should still be able to payout like  of estimated payments even without the funds but that s a huge hit and qualifies as insolvent to me  The Social Security shortfall to the extent that it actually exists is entirely artificial in nature If Republicans weren t committed to destroying the social safety net so that their donor class could afford a fifth mansion we would not be having this discussion   gt Does tweaking now mean complete and total rework and change of its primary mission Does it mean tweaks every decade as the old juice doesnt work  It means adjusting the program to meet it s designed goal of preventing a world where senior citizens have to choose between starving to death and freezing to death Just like how any program or system public or private should be looked at periodically to make sure it s still doing what it s supposed to and adjusted if needed   gt It should have broader support You are much better off looking after your own interests than with SS  Why do you think that Social Security was created in the first place We cannot count on all citizens to make only the best and most informed decisions through their entire lives We know this because before Social Security was a thing people who were poor and could no longer work could and did die for it And it is morally repugnant to just shrug your shoulders and say  it s their own poor decision making when faced with people literally starving when they can no longer work   gt Personal liberty and freedom  Without the backbone of a strong government to limit excesses  ie maintenance  that devolves into violence and exploration and quickly disappears 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alot of your post was rambling nonsense so I just picked out tidbits that I wanted to respond to   gt Or did you forget how everyone acted when he imposed a travel ban on China super early on  LOL the only argument that you Trump supporters have is that Trump did his signature travel bans Guess what He messed EVERYTHING else up from the testing to the supplies to the downplaying of the crisis Hundreds of thousands if not millions will die but sure he closed the border   so     gt And his fucking bragging about ratings is just his normal narcissistic behaviors  Doing so during a crisis when people have lost their jobs getting sick and dying is the NOT the time to be a narcissistic prick But what do you expect of the guy who bragged  and lied about having the tallest building in the immediate aftermath of     gt All people do is fucking blame without admitting how they would ve done the same or maybe even a worse job  It s almost as if Trump is the leader of the nation and the one who s supposed to be leading a national response but isn t   gt And Fauci somehow does not think Trump botched this   Cause Fauci like every other Trump worker knows that he can t insult the sensitive president or else he gets fired    gt And when it comes to the blame game Do you blame the people who actually spread this virus Or do you blame any individual who didn t just decide by themselves to take measures to help against spreading it Blaming the government is easy sure  I blame the person at the top who happens to be Trump His absence of strong leadership has made the country that s supposed to be the most well prepared for a pandemic structurally one of the worst hit in the world That s a level of incompetence you don t see in alot of people   gt Oh and I when this is all over no one will care anymore No one will revisit the measures and have an alaysis what really worked well and what was probably to much What countries really did a bad or good job Just like everything else when the newscicle moved one  After Ebola Obama created a pandemic response team   that Trump fired in  Trump also wanted continued defunding of the CDC year over year and was even still set on doing so THIS year No amount of planning is idiot proof I guess   gt What about masks for all and everyone That s a super controversial topic   Oh please don t tell me you believe in Trump s conspiracy that the nurses are hoarding masks so that Trump doesn t need to send as many to their hospitals

PoliticalDiscussion,Also there s a big and increasing difference in life expectancy for white collar workers versus blue collar workers 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sounds nice and all but the problem is that so many people dont take that advice and spend more rather than save more given access to more funds You can save money at any income level  The idea that anyone can save more at any income level is absolutely not true  As someone with a six figure retirement account who has been saving for decades kids can blow through chunks of your income you never thought possible Congresswoman Katie Porter demonstrated this perfectly  in her questioning of JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond     The craziest thing in that demonstration is the income Porter used is over twice the federal minimum wage so someone in a similar financial situation making minimum wage or slightly above would be even worse off in that scenario 
PoliticalDiscussion,This right here  Taxing productive young people in order to give money to economically worthless senior citizens is exactly the opposite of the kind of market incentive we should be using to create a vibrant economy  I am fully convinced that Social Security and Medicare would never have passed if young people voted at the same rates as their grandparents 
PoliticalDiscussion, is huge However means testing for regular people ensures the existing problems with social security get passed to millennials   the generation  of which I m part who has already gone without the benefits that current SS recipients had during their lifetimes wages far more commensurate with economic growth the existence of pensions at many companies  more affordable college tuition a job market that doesn t necessitate a college tuition to the extent that the current one does  more affordable home prices mortgages etc The list goes on   When I say  regular people  I mean anyone making  VERY conservatively less than ten million dollars per year The only means tests that makes sense are those that tax the absolute shit out of multi billion dollar corporations and baby boomers with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars NOW Whenever anyone suggests this an army of boomers says  they re coming after my social security  as though they all have hundreds of millions of dollars Hell if we started at  million and up with tax policies reflective of those that already existed in America for most of the th century that would be a profound start The real issue is convincing these people who are not the small number of loaded beyond all reason that we re not talking about them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would say a plan I would approve of is keeping the current rate but allowing an easier option of instead of a k you can put that money into your social security to and provide tax incentives for people to do so   Also get rid of the cap on social security at the same time Most people are just not educated enough to manage there own k benefits  Its not hard but people just don t learn how valuable they are until they are too late  So instead of putting money into a k I can have the choice instead to enroll it in the Governments own run retirement plan that can t be raided for any reason at all by congress The more money I put in up to a point the better the return  So if I got put  percent into that account from my salary then I get  percent matching and it gradually goes to  percent invest and  percent match with the caveat that any money that isn t used is recycled back into social security rather then given to your kids k and roths will still be around because it allows a transfer of wealth  While the government run program doesn t

PoliticalDiscussion,All we need to do is raise the payroll cap thereby making the rich pay more 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t have to go back to that stand on the Senate floor where he talks about trying  times to see him talking about cutting Social Security   Here he is  years ago   saying Paul Ryan was correct in trying to go after them Go to the  minute mark

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Remove the cap on payroll taxes    gt    gt currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners Remove this cap or if that s too much for people at the very least implement a more progressive bracket  I would be interested in a system where we raise the payroll tax but also allow for high income earners to privatize a portion of the increase It is politically football in part because there is a common understanding that higher income folks aren t going to get the same amount of money out that they pay into the SS system 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah that s a good point I haven t thought about while reading these threads At what age do people become inherently unproductive due to health or other factors At what point do we determine a persons age may make them a liability for themselves and others in the workplace 
PoliticalDiscussion,Mandatory private anything is an absolute no when it comes to taking care of the elderly It s a train wreck with our health insurance systems being private I can only imagine that a private pension system means less for the elderly and more for the rich CEOs that run the thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhh yeah it is SS isn t much to live on but since the elderly can t work it s one means by which they don t starve  People that stay poor all their lives and can no longer work should just   die 
PoliticalDiscussion,id dismantle it entirely
PoliticalDiscussion,If you have a credible rape accusation that s not the kind of shot that misses in the modern Democratic party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Especially since a high earner was likely paying more into the program than many low earners who qualify did This would just reinforce the  redistribution of wealth arguments that the wealthy like to throw around in order justify killing these kinds of programs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would you be for cutting the payout It seems like that would be the only thing left if everything else breaks what SS is

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Increase immigration immigrants are typically younger and can add to the long term solvency of the Trust Fund Currently we have about  or so new arrivals each year Significant increases in that say    or more   could be huge boons to our economy and our social welfare system  Immigration only increases total GDP it doesn t increase GDP per capita In fact it actually reduces GDP per capita growth slightly Total GDP is irrelevant for individual quality of life and only matters in terms of geopolitical power for those so inclined individual quality of life is dependent on GDP per capita India has a GDP that is more than  times Switzerland s would you rather be an average Indian or an average Swiss  So yes immigration increases economic growth but since there are more people sharing that pie the end result is nil for native citizens or even slightly negative because their share of the pie ends up being a bit smaller than it would have been otherwise  Also immigration only pushes back the day of reckoning since immigrants get old as well and if they have no more kids than native citizens do then you ll still need to find more immigrants to keep supporting old immigrants and so on and so forth This obviously creates sociocultural and political issue of its own And obviously immigration has to come from somewhere the total net migration balance of the world is balanced  unless aliens live among us   so to have positive migration some other country must have negative migration  emigration  That can only work if the latter countries maintain very high fertility  effectively rich countries outsourcing childbirth to developing countries  but in fact fertility in the developing world is continually decreasing  fortunately   So immigration must eventually stop no matter what we do  Therefore immigration only buys time at the cost of sociocultural disruption of a society and is not a true permanent solution to the issue of solvability of pension and social welfare problems 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not really an investment  It s inherently zero balance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Raising eligibility age is just a polite way of saying  reducing lifetime benefits  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And those programs are much more expensive than  of the GDP  total size of social security   The Military is significantly less than  of GDP  This isn t the s anymore  Military spending as a  of GDP for the last  decades has been significantly lower than the post WW average 
PoliticalDiscussion,bullshit neoliberal talking points   People will stop investing if they make a little less money on their investments  no they wont  In fact money made  from money  EG investment income should be taxed AT A HIGHER rate than income from labor because its not real work  rich people sitting around getting richer because they have money should be paying way more in taxes on that income than someone who goes and does hard labor eight hours a day 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s always been pay as you go hasn t it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Remove the cap on payroll taxes currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners   It is actually  K  Not      gt   Means test benefits   reducing the benefits for the highest earners with the most saved already can go a long way toward solvency Moreover this can be coupled with more generous benefits for lower income recipients   This already somewhat happens as the increase in payout in not proportional to the increase in payments  Thus lower income people are much more likely to get out significantly more than they pay in than a rich person  In my opinion the best option would be for allowing an opt out after making more than a certain amount  say K where you can invest your portion and half your employers portion into your K while the other half goes into the fund  This decreases liabilities for Social Security while keeping money coming in 
PoliticalDiscussion,Raise wages Plain and simple 
PoliticalDiscussion,This comment written by an imbecile More people on the system living longer lives means the system as is needs more funding 
PoliticalDiscussion,Big talk about a group that can t get out to vote never mind actually take up arms 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We know explicitly redistributive programs are extremely unpopular with Americans  Except they aren t Medicare Medicaid and SNAP are some of the most popular public programs in the country   gt Making the Social Security program something that obviously hurts most Americans is not going to make it more popular  How does increasing tax brackets on the highest earners hurt most Americans 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve always been all in on  and  They should be the most politically feasible too since they would be fairly simple updates to the law and  should be based on a percentage rather than a fixed amount   I feel would have some adverse affects in that more people would hold off on retirement prior to receiving benefits This would inhibit upward mobility careerwise for younger generations 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt if we dont account for disabled people widows children etc I guess but thats some big not accounting for there  Children never count  Widows only get it from retired person s benefits     gt lol you just circle talked You cant have an indefinitely growing population   I m not sure about that  But in the time scales we are talking about which is just one generation irrelevant     gt you are also forgetting inflation  Bill worked in  and paid in  bucks Now in  he wants k plus COLAs eevry year  As long as he paid in his  that money went to a retired person at that price level  He collects from another retired person at the new price level  Assuming that we are just talking inflation wages track prices  What Bill paid in doesn t matter that money was spent in  
PoliticalDiscussion,People would do well to keep in mind the resource constraints of SS rather than the money constraint When people pay into SS the government does not buy a bunch of resources then put them into a big vault with a  year timelock on it It s a generational transfer from the young to the old  the more elderly there are the more resources must be transferred from the young  Thinking of it this way it DOES NOT MATTER how much money has been saved in the SS fund  or in private savings if the workers do not produce enough resources to provide for the entire population including the elderly The only way to solve this problem would be to make some of the elderly work  perhaps by increasing eligibility age   On the other hand there is no real economic barrier to SS solvency if there are enough resources to provide for the entire population Here it s a political problem  we must reduce consumption among the young and distribute that consumption to the old 
PoliticalDiscussion,TIL the purpose of SS is for escaping poverty
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely do not remove capital gains tax That s what incentivizes people to save there own money in IRA accounts
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We should be able to remove SCOTUS jurists from their lifetime appointment via majority national vote   put it on the ballot after a petition gets x number of citizen signatures  If you do this you would need to make it a super majority or something  Simple majority for something as complex as a SCOTUS case is an insane idea  Judges need to rule on the law  Not on worrying about populist backlash to a ruling 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will create a massive welfare trap 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This also raises the need to make savings and investing more available to lower income individuals as well as sound financial advice  Sounds nice and all but the problem is that so many people dont take that advice and spend more rather than save more given access to more funds You can save money at any income level 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly both Joe Biden and Trump have said at various points that they ll try to cut social security  The only real hope for it is electing someone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,The president gets to call himself a wartime president which is not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Replace it with UBI
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t agree with that see  and  where the Dems were able to accrue a supermajority for  months Something like that is unthinkable now but that happened back then  was supposed to be favorable for them but the base got complacent which is common whenever a party s seeking a third term and Hilary didn t exactly inspire a lot of people to turn out  heavily favored the GOP but  is going to be great for them I imagine 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the solvability of Social Security is only an issue because of its nature Namely because of the fact that it is a collective fund with defined benefits where one s SS benefits is unrelated to the amount of money they have put into it Everyone on it is entitled to a defined income based on his previous private income at retirement So if the government refuses to increase contributions and continues paying out the benefits at one point the  fund will be gone and the benefits will have to be sourced from general funds So even if SS runs out of money it doesn t mean that it will stop paying what it owes because the government will keep it going through money injected from its general funds  So it won t actually go bust unless the party forming the government decides not to support it and lets it die which is a political choice but not an inevitability Otherwise the government can use a mix of reducing payouts  increasing the age of retirement and lowering benefits and increasing contributions to keep the SS fund around and avoid having to source SS funds from general government revenue  Alternatively one could change the very nature of Social Security from a general fund with defined benefits to defined contribution private accounts in which people would be forced to put money And rather than receive a fixed check every month after retirement they would have to decide how to use the money from their private account Singapore has something like that if I understand correctly People have their own private accounts of the Central Provident Fund which they and their employer have to pay into by law and that they can also top up with voluntary contributions That money belongs to them but is frozen they can only start withdrawing it when they are at retirement age or in a few selected scenarios in which they are allowed to take some money out  like medical emergencies and when buying their first house   In such a system since every individual is only entitled to money they have put in  and interests  there is no solvability issue   but there are social issues Namely one s private account can run out of money at which point the person is old unable to work and deprived of any income So that means the government has to step in and offer a pension anyway to the people in that situation or at least some kind of welfare There s also the issue that poor people won t have a lot of money in their account at the end of their life even worse for the disabled So you solve the fiscal issue but create social disparity issues 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What is being brought into the system is also inherently less because that following generation is a smaller population  That s not true population just isn t growing as fast as previously expected People  only make up   of the US population  year olds alone make up   of the population  Raising the age limit will be the most effective way to maintain Social Security s viability We ve done it before 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Let s start with a base of are  workers for each retired person paying in  of wages   ok   gt Then the retired people on average get  of one workers salary  if we dont account for disabled people widows children etc I guess but thats some big not accounting for there   gt Make is  workers per retired person and this drops to    ok   gt Create a growing population so it is more like  per retired person and you can fund    lol you just circle talked You cant have an indefinitely growing population Not without well massive issue around quality of life environment etc Even if you housed everyone in rabbit cages it would eventually come to a stop This is ponzi scheme level thinking    gt But it is not impossible regardless of which scenario you are in  you are also forgetting inflation  Bill worked in  and paid in  bucks Now in  he wants k plus COLAs eevry year
PoliticalDiscussion,This is wrong and you re citing a paper talking about straight cash assistance Not a paid into program like social security or income traps like affordable housing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would you increase the SS payouts along with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you were trying to sabotage a campaign in this way you d wait until the candidate became the official nominee ideally right as he was nominating a woman so that this would become the story of the summer   If a global pandemic shows up though you can t count on your story gaining traction at any specific point or maybe even at all so you might as well throw it out there 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s pretty well accepted by all political stripes that it exists though to what extent and severity and possible solutions obviously change   Like for instance if I had a child and was living at home on government benefits of some kind and then got a job I now have to factor in childcare and transportation and the money I make as a low skill worker is not going to do much on that and the government will dial back or eliminate certain benefits I receive   The progressive mindset generally seeks to raise the floor on stuff like that so going from unemployed to working is not such a shock to the system A more conservative solution is usually something like a reverse income tax but I d say that lacks any real support among Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,We need support after retirement too   
PoliticalDiscussion,Put the social security back in a seperate account so the pigs in congress quit using it for other things problem solved LBJ was the president that combined it with the general fund to finance the Vietnam war 
PoliticalDiscussion,What   You mean rich old people SHOULDN T just hold on to their money instead of stimulating our largely service economy  Sounds like liberal propaganda  s
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve often wondered what effect covid would have on social security if it were to truly kill millions
PoliticalDiscussion,All financial markets are somewhat of a pyramid scheme bubble based on demographics Fortunately the US has net positive immigrant inflows to at least mitigate the looming disaster vs a country like China that has net outflows As the average country population age ages out of the workforce things will get much worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you want me to pay more  remove cap on withholding tax and receive less  means test benefits  Well yeah if you screw over millions you might be able to  fix the program 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not a loan  Moreover SCOTUS as ruled that you are in no way owed social security just because you paid the tax  Strictly speaking there is nothing to  pay into    gt  Welfare trap is an unfounded neoliberal talking point  Just about any economist would disagree with you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am aware of that But people DO pay into it We loan it to retirees with the expectation that we will get it later  Welfare trap is an unfounded neoliberal talking point 
PoliticalDiscussion,The ratio of paid in to paid out is much lower for low income than high income  The payout ratio rises much more sharply than the pay in ratio   As for wealthier people living longer they do  But they also often work longer and at higher wages so they keep paying in for longer  They also have less dangerous jobs and get disabled less often 
PoliticalDiscussion,The money you pay to social security isn t set aside for you later  It is spent immediately on current retirees 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why do I hear people say that they don t expect to get social security all the time     Personally I m gonna save for retirement as if I won t get social security but if I pay into it my whole life I fully expect to get it when I m old and even if congress does nothing to solve the issues it has we can still expect  of the benefits to still be there when we retire
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If you re average income the only reason that you are getting  is because of the Democrats  Once again lies and half truths  Here s a real truth for you Millions of average Americans would of already received a thousand   check from the government to pay their bill s with if the democratic party would of passed the bill instead of stopping it to add in money for the Kennedy foundation money for solar power money for other rich businesses that are not related to emergencies etc  I am being civil You being daft is a appropriate description of your willful ignorance and lies 
PoliticalDiscussion,We have to raise the age of eligibility If we want to sustain Social Security we can t translate support of the program into complete rigidity Social Security must adapt or it will continue to dig into the hole 
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically speaking what actually happens is that the SSA invests the funds into treasury bonds and collects interest on them  The US is borrowing against itself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is it really  welfare when you ve paid into it your whole life though 
PoliticalDiscussion,What was the hyperinflation rate last year 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is  really that politically controversial I feel like a supermajority of voters would OK that in a heartbeat even those making over  K 
PoliticalDiscussion,It should be tied to the actuary tables 
PoliticalDiscussion,So your plan to save social security is go back to the gold standard or get rid of the dollar and replace it with bitcoin 
PoliticalDiscussion,I could be wrong but I think they meant remove the FAVORABLE tax rates on capital gains   Which I would totally get  behind     And I ll take it further to suggest that passbook savings should get the same rates as cap gains but they don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s even worse than that US borrows money to pay for Social Security 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The second is people noting that an  individual is a shitty person with obvious authoritarian instincts observations that were mostly made before the current crisis began The two have nothing to do with each other  Yes they do have something in common If the individual does have authoritarian instincts they would instinctively made power grabs something that occurs pretty often in times of crisis but they have not  Do states have the power to institute their own quarantines and martial law If they do why can t the governor implement them Why does it have to be the federal government If the governors can take such an action I would like to see them take it first and then if that isn t good enough see the federal government step in I hate the idea of the federal government having to do everything  Serious question here If people think Trump is incompetent at his job and is incapable of taking the correct action Why do people want him to take said action if they think he will fuck it up and could make things worse If he could make things worse wouldnt it make more sense for Trump to take no action and let the states implement policies that they have a better grasp of implementing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tax the rich Simple 
PoliticalDiscussion,But we re not talking about the current SS we re talking about a hypothetical one
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow I cannot imagine a person being this heartless to their fellow citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,i hadn t thought of that but damn you re exactly right    If we think people don t save enough now  it would get incredibly worse if we means test 
PoliticalDiscussion, I don t like raising the age to retire  making people wait until   who for  years were told  is already pretty bad   i think that party trick has be done and needs to be laid to rest    I love removing the income cap   think its at k    This is the most palatable idea politically  since it won t affect  of people     means test is already done in a way  if you get a gov pension  they deduct from your SS       people who don t need SS probably have a lot of socks  not sure if you saw what happened to the stock market the past  weeks  someone like my dad  weeks ago would means test his SS down  but this week he needs it     You d have to set the bar so high this won t net much savings    good thinking  maybe SS funds can be loans   equity positions when companies need bail outs  seems to happen every  years and in the long run its a great investment   also SS funds could buy stocks  only if there s a huge market crash  it helps prop up prices and then they only buy at a huge discount    This would work as long as you get people who don t need a ton of social services themselves  Though looking at it only from an SS point of view and not caring about the total in out this totally solves it       there s one more idea that would be the LEAST popular idea ever  lol ban abortions    K more births a year would fix the solvency issue  in about  years soon as the kids grow up and start working     but even typing this idea is worth like  down votes   a politician would get voted out for even muttering it  so  ain t gonna happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,But Biden was also going to become Vice President  years ago   We are Post Super Tuesday Biden in the lead Bernie needs a very big wins now It s all way to convenient   It makes me think  of  things   She is lying to help Bernie    She is telling the truth but weaponizing her tragedy to help Bernie  Neither of those scenarios are good for anyone  I have been hearing she has been Pro Biden this decade Pro Putin  Wtf  Anti Biden  apparently asking Trump to investigate Hunter Biden on Twitter   Pro Warren and Pro Bernie   She also went to Vox and The Intercept instead of an outlet that would help her more
PoliticalDiscussion,Not in the traditional sense afaik But lots of people use taxable brokerage accounts  ESPPs and other vehicles that do benefit from a lower long term capital gains rate
PoliticalDiscussion,Is this an evidence based term or is it just reinforcing existing political beliefs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe reassess the situation in a year or so
PoliticalDiscussion,We need to slowly phase it out It is a terrible Ponzi scheme that was never sustainable It just so happens that Millenials and Gen Z are at the bottom of the pyramid 
PoliticalDiscussion,Taxes should operate from the median with an upper bound progressive point ending at    So as you earn more it becomes harder to continue earning more and at a certain point  personally I think that value should be   of total national calculated wealth there is nothing further gained from trying to earn more  S S could easily become solvent   The primary issue is that in real dollars the aggregate pays less in taxes than years before  because the ratio is higher and dollar value is lower Most taxes are paid by the rich and the lower their rates are the less solvent programs are  Of course sovereign accounting works differently than household accounting but we are seeing harsh wealth inequality impacts as a result of  years of lower tax rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is your opinion on the democrats house bill that included provisions like requiring airlines who accept federal assistance to place a union representative on their board 
PoliticalDiscussion,How about increase tax on high incomes 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are so misinformed I don t even know where to start Literally no one who knows Bernie could say with conscience that he is an asshole He fought for justice and for vulnerable people all his life He read every page of the bills to make sure they don t stuff shit provisions in there to screw over the people He worked on bills and then took his name out so they would be passed He is  years old a vulnerable target for the virus and he still goes to the Senate to fight for the workers He worked all his life for people like you undereducated angry and misinformed individuals so you could have a better quality of life   But you carry on being you I have no doubt you would reply me in bad faith People like you don t want to take in new information You want to attack  belittle and conquer for whatever illusion of power that gets you Meanwhile the progressives will actually work for the betterment of all our lives We pity toxic persons like you 
PoliticalDiscussion,A slight marginal income tax increase on agi above k or reducing the estate tax exemption down from  million 
PoliticalDiscussion,First off Trump hasn t really left the White House the concept of traveling as little as possible applies to the executive branch personnel as much as the rest of us and he has all the tools he needs from the White House it s designed for the president to run the country out of  Secondly Trump and Biden aren t in remotely comparable situations Biden doesn t hold office he has no power to world and no responsibilities to any constituents at the moment Trump is the most powerful person in the country and should be leading the nationwide response to the pandemic 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right I m not sure what I was thinking of I could have swore there was some form of retirement account that did have capital gains taxes involved I m gonna have to go look now
PoliticalDiscussion,The fact that people still do not understand this baffles me  Corporate taxes are highly inefficient 
PoliticalDiscussion,just lift the cap and its perfectly solvent   right now income above K  doesn t pay into SS  raise the SS rate slightly   i think its more fair to lift the cap 
PoliticalDiscussion,It should be tied to the actuary tables 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It sounds like a  you problem Why should they get to force others to pay for them not planning  You are aware that people end up needing this income as they age in many cases through no fault of their own correct 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think if he d proposed something substantive that was new novel or uniquely on point it might have sparked interest As it is it s weak sauce and I don t think that really does him any good 
PoliticalDiscussion,However interest on a savings account is taxed at your normal tax  bracket whereas capital gains are taxed much more favorably   It s not a even playing field This is just one example 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only reason that social security is in trouble is the gop want it to be in trouble All we have to do is increase how much we put in there And have Politicians keep their grubby hands off it   Social Security is not entitlement we pay into it 
PoliticalDiscussion,this pandemic is absolute proof of the labour theory of value thats for sure  As soon as workers stopped going to work the economy crashed  no infrastructure has been destroyed companies have their inventory and supply chains are still active  but when the prospect of employees not being able to go to work came up the stock market was wiped out 
PoliticalDiscussion,haha stupid poors why don t you just invest and make millions  very sound analysis  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that this map pretty well summarizes the trend we can expect with convenient color coding that matches the typical party colors    Areas with a lot of population growth will probably trend blue and areas with population decreases will probably trend red   The whole Southwest and east coast will trend blue and the whole Midwest will trend red Anywhere with big growing metros will trend more blue States without big growing metros  or just smaller metros that do grow but are not dominant compared to the whole state will stay or go red   Democrats are the party of the future and Republicans are the party of the past Their platforms may adjust to account for changing demographics but for now this is how I see it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It sounds like a  you problem Why should they get to force others to pay for them not planning  This is too nonsensically idealistic We had a problem  the elderly were eating dog food and dying homeless in large numbers that we solved  by forcing people to pay into retirement accounts for their old age  
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea of current US welfare creating an welfare trap has been disproven     Now its possible to create a welfare trap but  time out of  when people bring it p there is no data to support it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Remove the cap on payroll taxes currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners Remove this cap or if that s too much for people at the very least implement a more progressive bracket   gt  Means test benefits reducing the benefits for the highest earners with the most saved already can go a long way toward solvency Moreover this can be coupled with more generous benefits for lower income recipients  It s worth pointing out that this would be a fundamental shift in what social security is intended to be  As of now and when it was created the benefits are mean to act as a form of savings trust that has your benefits being in some way proportionate to what you contribute in the form of taxes These two things would shift it to something meant to result in a redistribution of wealth and not a savings trust 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are not taxed as it grows  That is incorrect You do indeed get those gains tax free in a Roth
PoliticalDiscussion,A welfare trap is any time a negative behavior is incentivized because of a government program because there s not a meaningful action you can take to improve your condition without removing the benefit thus making the benefit negligible  You get the opposite of the intended outcome If ss is means tested then you ll have people potentially taking steps the government doesn t want to avoid it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The answer is really really really really simple   Eliminate the maximum amount of taxable earnings  Boom fucking DONE 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Like none of this makes him worse than Trump  I absolutely agree but we were specifically talking about Social Security 
PoliticalDiscussion,These are all good modifications 
PoliticalDiscussion,Military does not cost more than Social Security  Medicare Medicaid is   Trillion SS is  T and defense is  B  And your proposal to just fund it is just saying to do nothing  We re already funding it 
PoliticalDiscussion,You get taxed on cap gains while its in there so you don t have to pay taxes when it comes out Other wise you get all those gains for free when they come out at retirement
PoliticalDiscussion,COVID is going to save social security all by itself 
PoliticalDiscussion,At least I didn t try to pretend that  million  majority 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I disagree At the end of the day we re at a funding disadvantage We re not willing to accept big money from oil companies big pharma defense contractors etc It doesn t help that MSM isn t going to give us a fair shake  No candidate had more money and a larger grassroots organization than Bernie At what point do progressives realize that he didn t run a good campaign   The media is no one s friend This is the same media who repeated lies about Obama s birth certificate had wall to wall coverage of Hillary s emails during the election and reported about Monica Lewinsky nonstop  You think they are going to lay out the red carpet for  any Democrat let alone Bernie    This   is how they covered Biden early in the campaign   The broke lifeless dead in the water campaign Their words    gt It might take a while  We are now on the third election cycle of this movement The margins aren t getting any better for progressives It s getting worse    AOC   is the only progressive who seems to see the writing on the wall Bernie s tactics failed   It s time for progressives to adjust if they actually want  electoral success I applaud her for having self awareness    gt Maybe but I see it also as the great equalizer At the end of the day Millenials late Gen Xers and Gen Zers we re not going to have TV subscription so we re not going to hear from MSM as much   And do you think Republicans aren t using the internet to their advantage as well   Republicans have conditioned their base to completely ignore the MSM  unless they say what they want to hear and have cultivated a presence online that allows their base to remain impenetrable to anything  This  has to be pierced This is a problem that goes beyond Democrat or progressive    gt I don t think single payer is radical and I damn sure don t think most Americans especially among younger Americans view it that way  It s not about being radical it s about changing the status quo It s hard to convince people who like their healthcare coverage to be willing to change or give it up   This is the fear Republicans play into  It s also why MA is a foolish goal The goal should be  universal healthcare coverage Period   Who cares how we get there  When you say MA and promise to end private insurance you re talking about taking away what people have  who like it and ending hundreds of thousands of jobs  Make the argument that this is a moral necessity all you want but people ultimately vote for their own self interest Progressives  have to realize this    gt While I m sure you re not a corporatist I m sure you understand why they re frustrated  Unless this frustration translates into turnout be angry all you want In  the midterms that crushed Democrats House majority was more about apathy than anything else   Turnout was  awful  They somewhat recovered in  but blew it in  as well   This is a problem with Democrats and progressives   The DNC doesn t care if a bunch of progressives win elections they just need to win elections    This is a collective failure of Democrats and  progressives  But to simply blame the DNC media or centrists is a copout   Progressives are not helping solve the real problem facing liberalism as a whole geography and turnout   Until that equation is solved it Bernie and AOC and the Overton Window don t mean anything   I wish we could all come together to realize this 
PoliticalDiscussion,don t you find it shocking that economically worthless elderly people aren t chomping at the bit to fill the void currently created by productive young people given the present global economic shutdown it would make senior citizens at least a bit more useful for the world   and if we get rid of most people with disabilities that lessen their overall financial benefit to society we could probably move a bit more towards positive growth for the remaining healthy young people 
PoliticalDiscussion,No what they re doing is perfectly legal  congress made it okay But it s also not how the fund was originally structured nor how it was promised to people and many  most  people still believe it operates the way it was originally designed  For the record  Congress probably did the right thing with the funds by allowing SSA to invest in t bonds It reduces risk while ostensibly allowing the fund to keep growing around the rate of inflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Give me what i put in then dont take money from me for social security ever again I can save without government intervention
PoliticalDiscussion,If the government owes itself money it s not an investment  It s on both sides of the transaction  All that  investment in treasury bonds means is that social security will be paid by future tax revenue from the general fund 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a comically crappy post compared to the well argued piece it s rebutting
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems like you were  And we have to govern around them don t we  So how would you handle crime Criminals make bad decisions and then we have to pay to incarcerate them How do you flip that around Everyone is irresponsible in some way Ignoring that leads to bad policy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends on the  year old 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Are you suggesting that because the group as a whole is wealthy that every member of that group is wealthy Surely not  no   gt Because some human beings will always be irresponsible  And thats ok they can live irresponsibly then   gt If you aren t making policies to account for people s negative qualities as well as their positive qualities then you are just making bad policy  The bad policy is forcing the people making good decisions to cover the ones making bad ones 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m totally against the first one  Tons of peoples work is very physically demanding and their bodies can barely hold up by the time they are even   The best way to save it is just eliminating the caps like you said and making all income subject to it  Problem pretty much solved for decades 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve been thinking that this stimulus could be a good test of modern monetary theory If we had just printed ourselves the  tn I don t think it would have been a problem for inflation since demand is so low As long as supply chains stay intact we hopefully won t see huge inflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ha ha you think SSI has a chance to survive     The FED is spending BILLIONS A DAY propping up a broken overvalued market right now They have been for weeks They are buying borderline junk bonds to prop up the  safe haven income assets as well  You will get your  SSI payment as promised but that might be enough to go out to dinner once a month at this rate of hyperinflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot  Get rid of it    It s inefficient and makes people wrongly think the government will take care of them when old which is a lie 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s a bit funny on how people are demanding the government to step in While not long ago people likened him as a dictator wannabe with how he likes to cozy up to other dictators  It s a bit funny how you think those two things are related in any way The first is people demanding the federal the institution made up of millions and millions of people step in and act to respond to the worst crisis since what WWII The second is people noting that an  individual is a shitty person with obvious authoritarian instincts observations that were mostly made before the current crisis began The two have nothing to do with each other 
PoliticalDiscussion,What must be done Well the politicians raided that fund right after it started so I d start there politicians on both sides need to get the hands out of the cookie jar     Next using the Fed to print billions and trillions of dollars means our dollar will be worth less and eventually worthless so your SS payments are going to be worth about as much as the paper the check was printed on We have to get away from the madness of money printing and get to sound money 
PoliticalDiscussion,The market gives us a choice between something that is cost effective and something that is fast That is why it is not viable to deal with these sort of crisis s People are not purely rational actors at the  best of times in a time of crisis they re even more likely to be ruled by emotions  witness all those people buying up multi year supplies of toilet paper  That distorts the market even repealing price gouging laws you could end up in a situation where the market is responding to consumer panic that has no real baring on the actual emergency That s why the government needs to be able to step in and say  no you re making this much of x at y cost even if that hurts your bottom line in the short term  
PoliticalDiscussion,Corporate taxes usually work on profits so they actually incentivise reinvestment since sales tax is less than the profit tax But they also incentivise moving headquarters to or registering in lower tax regions which I think was a big reason that congress wanted to lower the corporate tax in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Gates walking into a homeless shelter makes everyone in the room on average a multi millionaire It doesn t mean that everyone actually is a multi millionaire 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps I misunderstand what you mean by  on paper  Are you saying the SS administration is not following the letter of the law 
PoliticalDiscussion,We can start by stop lowering the payroll taxes every time we have a financial crisis Obama reduced it my  in  and Trump proposed eliminating payroll taxes until the end of the year for the current crisis The GOP has been scheming how to take down the SS system since they lost the Helvering v Davis case in    Investing the SS funds like the Canadians do would be a good plan but how can anyone trust another entity to run a system with nearly   T of value Greed is so ingrained in our culture the fund likely would disappear quicker than if we just kept status quo The Canadian system has realized an average  yield over the last decade or more Maybe we should hire the Canadians to manage our SS fund 
PoliticalDiscussion, only idiots pay back into the system that allowed them to succeed in the first place 
PoliticalDiscussion,WoNt SoMeOnE tHiNk Of ThE  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt lol what is this unfounded logic based on Higher earners get back less as a percent then low earners do to bend points If anything they are paying more then their fair share   fair share is based on how much wealth they are extracting now which is insanely disproportionate to how much they pay back in taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt ok doesnt change the point that the top earners arent paying their fair share  lol what is this unfounded logic based on Higher earners get back less as a percent then low earners do to bend points If anything they are paying more then their fair share
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you demonstrate that with numbers   How much does someone who earned at or above the contribution cap get back vs what they paid in  And how does that compare to someone say middle of the income level and bottom  All other things being equal like age of retirement and life span 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not quick or cheap but the US government can secure new supply chains far more efficiently than private companies I think there are likely to be obstacles across the board but that should mean it s even more important to get things started ASAP
PoliticalDiscussion,If you have a roth they re taxed as income going in and untaxed completely coming out Again nothing to do with the cap gains rate
PoliticalDiscussion,That isn t even remotely true On paper the SSA fund is an individual retirement account for each and every individual paying in whose net benefits will ultimately be paid out of what they paid in  In practice people live longer than anticipated so they end up consuming their  paid in portion before they die and due to a number of funding investing decisions made by SSA current beneficiaries are paid out of current receipts 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was just an example of how a welfare trap works  The numbers weren t meant to be realistic though most examples of mean tested social security I ve seen do use monthly income to determine the cut off 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not if you have a Roth ira The earnings are taxed at capital gains
PoliticalDiscussion,I just pulled the numbers from   but as it turns out those numbers don t mean what I thought they meant The top line  Budgetary Resources means what they re allowed to spend this year but includes appropriations carried forward from previous multi year appropriations and no year appropriations that don t have to be spent in any particular year Agencies generally aren t going to spend all their multi year or no year appropriations all in one year so those numbers shouldn t be considered as part of the annual budget  So I was wrong to consider those numbers to be annual actual spending  So I ll walk back what I said before I should have kept it to medical expenses which are growing faster than GDP while recognizing that other than the bump of baby boomers Social Security retirement benefits will stabilize as a percentage of GDP 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My blatant misinformation about payroll caps  yes   gt Have you ever maxed out your contribution  Yep   gt At the time it even occurred to me how ridiculous it was that the more I made the less I was expected to contribute back to society as a percentage of my earnings  How can you make the cap and not understand basic math and how programs like SS work  see the cap on inputs is there so that there is a cap on payouts People don t want rich people getting  or k a month even if they paid in a bunch The goal of SS was to force some savings and teh cap does that Because the SS program is  individualized as in you have an  account with a ledger and credits and what not there is no point in taking more  Now as to  contribute back to society as a percentage of my earnings  Thats what income tax and charity is for So if you re not doing your part thats on you as you are more then free to do so at will   gt You have no idea what you are talking about  lol no that would be you Just cause you maxed out once doesnt make you some expert   gt You heard some whiny rich bitch talk about  bend points  thought it sounded cool so now you are a parrot  lol aww you mad cause you learned something Bet you didn t know what a bend point even was until I brought it up I know about them because I want to maximize my early retirement
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly pegged to your wages not an individual retirement account managed by the federal government  You ve also changed your stance You went from Social Security being on paper an individual retirement account to now saying that it was just sold and implied to be that way Regardless of people not understanding how the system works it was never that way on paper 
PoliticalDiscussion,I too love the taste of boot leather
PoliticalDiscussion,I m extremely agree with  and  I don t want the treasury owning stocks I also think a means test encourages people to not invest or withdraw more But maybe a modest reduction of the top end would be okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,One of us is a bot working on a computer whose day job is this the other is a civilian on mobile 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you read the section you just quoted to me the benefits rate is pegged to your wages  The implication being that it was a result of your payments in The exact mechanics of how that was accomplished is not the same as saying it was never sold that way to the American people because it absolutely was Further the difference is more about retaining paid in money for future payments versus current payments covering current recipients  which the quoted section doesn t refer to at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because being a laborer is easy There is no thinking You pass go and collect    You get guidelines on how to do everything   I m currently a laborer   it s not hard at all and I m blown away they pay me as much as they do I m even more blown away they make a good profit off of me   About  of bussiness fail after  years     Are smart enough to get an idea financed Then are you risky enough to take on the endeavour    chance you lose everything and it will probably be out of your control    see Chinese beer flu   You have to worry about everyone you hire is actually a decent person and not taking advantage of you there is a lot more stress in making decisions that affect not only your life but others that depend on you  Even if your bussiness makes money doesnt mean you re going to be rich 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of the two of us only one has actually provided evidence of their assertions so 
PoliticalDiscussion,My blatant misinformation about payroll caps Have you ever maxed out your contribution I have It s kind of a milestone for people who make enough to max it out but aren t necessarily  high earners  I would max my contribution sometime around September October    At the time it even occurred to me how ridiculous it was that the more I made the less I was expected to contribute back to society as a percentage of my earnings    You have no idea what you are talking about You heard some whiny rich bitch talk about  bend points  thought it sounded cool so now you are a parrot 
PoliticalDiscussion,You seem to like it 
PoliticalDiscussion,That was fascinating and sad information    
PoliticalDiscussion, No u doesn t work past grade school 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t know what platitudes are don t you Because Joe Biden only has platitudes And a history of touching women and children And a horrible voting record And confessing outright he has no empathy And belittles insults and threatens to physically assault civilians who asks him questions on the campaign trail And a rape accusation 
PoliticalDiscussion,On paper it has never been an individual retirement account  The original bill was  pages You can just look at it and see it was never intended to be an individual retirement account  Title II Sec  is the relevant portion  PDF warning   
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe she wasn t ready to have her life turned upside down   This is what happened to the Uber whistleblower   gt Initially it was mostly my relatives and friends from Silicon Valley who were being contacted but then they whoever  they were began contacting people I hadn t spoken to in years like an old neighbor I hadn t seen since I was a teenager  Someone s digging really deep on you Susan  my neighbor said  and it s scary how far back they re going  Whoever was trying to dig up dirt on me was going deep into my history talking to people that I d forgotten I d even known I didn t know who was trying to get this information and I didn t know how they were able to find out so much about my past I didn t know what they were looking for and I didn t know what they were going to find It was terrifying  And this was freaking Uber Tara s like is about to get fucked up 
PoliticalDiscussion,She still maintains the earlier allegations its just that she is revealing an incident she didn t mention among the first ones 
PoliticalDiscussion,She was probably considering the consequences   This is what happened to the Uber whistleblower   gt Initially it was mostly my relatives and friends from Silicon Valley who were being contacted but then they whoever  they were began contacting people I hadn t spoken to in years like an old neighbor I hadn t seen since I was a teenager  Someone s digging really deep on you Susan  my neighbor said  and it s scary how far back they re going  Whoever was trying to dig up dirt on me was going deep into my history talking to people that I d forgotten I d even known I didn t know who was trying to get this information and I didn t know how they were able to find out so much about my past I didn t know what they were looking for and I didn t know what they were going to find It was terrifying  And this was freaking Uber Tara s like is about to get fucked up 
PoliticalDiscussion,You say this as it wouldnt drastically effect anything   Capital gains tax exists as a tool for long term investing   You get rid of that and market volatility will sky rocket cause there is no advantages to holding stock over day trading   This is one of many examples of why that s a bad idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t say Tara changed her story either She said that what happened to Lucy Flores happened to her She seemed to be uncomfortable telling everything that Joe Biden did initially 
PoliticalDiscussion,The average social security benefit is  a month  So if you retire at  and live to  that about  in life time benefits 
PoliticalDiscussion,But that s crazy If you made a million dollars a year in the years leading up to your retirement why do you need social security Who cares who it  punishes  we re trying to help the impoverished here   It is like you said I don t think we should tax the rich it just punishes them for making more money Yet there is pretty wide agreement that progressive taxation is a good thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Raise the cap on FICA taxes or get used to  of benefits in  and going forward 
PoliticalDiscussion,More platitudes a weak excuse and another accusation of being a bot  So par for the course for Sanders supporters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or it won t and Social Security is a very small part of the calculation for those making  figures as to whether they work or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,He is a humble man But his supporters fight for him all the time There is a friggin chart of what he has done but I m on mobile and too tired to find it Look it up other actual non paid bots 
PoliticalDiscussion,It makes sense to me Feed the starving not the wealthy 
PoliticalDiscussion,That  investment is at the same time an equal liability to the government  It will get that money back with interest by future tax payments  How is an investment when the government owes itself money  If it were actually invested like in a sovereign wealth fund there would be no future tax liability 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Trump s poll numbers are increasing but head to head match ups are still not good  That Biden  poll should be terrifying to democrats with the electoral college and overweighting of more rural states that would probably be a decent trump victory 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it s been raised in recent years I just must ve been remembering an outdated number 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or we can grow faster than   over the next  years  Because all those doom and gloom numbers assume a   economic growth rate forever    Our average growth rate is significantly higher and Democratic policies raise the growth rate significantly over Republican policies  If we average  growth rate we re fine   There is no universal rule that says the SSI fund can t have debt  We can get to a point where it oscillates between the red and the black  Every other part of our government borrows from the social security fund it s not like the second we get to   we need to cut benefits 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can dispute literally anything  The word you re looking for is  debunked  and I m sure you ll provide sources that prove any of those things false  Any day now  And too bad that s not how the burden of proof works  But if Sanders has so many accomplishments you d think he d mention them at some point 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners  It s currently    isn t it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No candidate had more money and a larger grassroots organization than Bernie At what point do progressives realize that he didn t run a good campaign  I wasn t talking about Bernie but progressive candidates in general But regardless all it takes is one billionaire to overtake our grassroots funding AOC in her first election was out funded  to   I also disagree with that Bernie ran a bad campaign Up until the more centrist candidates coalesced Bernie was the front runner Biden looked like he didn t have prayer left in this race and was behind Kloubacar and Mayor Pete And at the end of the day he came second in this race Yeah it wasn t a perfect campaign but had the race stayed the way it did two months ago Bernie would have been in the lead Now I will criticize that he didn t change strategy when the established Democrats coalesced   gt The media is no one s friend This is the same media who repeated lies about Obama s birth certificate had wall to wall coverage of Hillary s emails during the election and reported about Monica Lewinsky nonstop You think they are going to lay out the red carpet for any Democrat let alone Bernie This is how they covered Biden early in the campaign The broke lifeless dead in the water campaign Their words  The media cares about sensationalism that s not surprising But I don t see the media criticizing Obama on the genocide in Yemen or how during his presidency the Dems lost over  seats in government Who cares about Monica Lewinski or Obama s birther scandal Only morally uptight Republicans cared about that stuff   But your article is from September What about their coverage of other centrist candidates such as Mayor Pete Kamala and Kloubachar at that time Poor Yang was barely getting any coverage At the same time Biden was giving a million reasons why he is a bad candidate and that he was running a bad campaign For example Biden said he could not empathize with young people s problems basically saying screw them  and another reason why I don t see any reason for me to vote for Biden    But the media clearly treated Biden with kid gloves once all the centrist candidates dropped out and endorsed Biden Literally right after the debate a few weeks ago the media responded to criticisms of Biden as if his record as a legislator doesn t matter They didn t call him out on the multiple lies he said including how he wasn t in favor of cutting social security   gt When you say MA and promise to end private insurance you re talking about taking away what people have  who like it and ending hundreds of thousands of jobs  First Bernie s bill doesn t outlaw private healthcare Second the point of the bill is to give maximum leverage because last thing we need is to concede to public option before the battle begins and just get Obamacare I don t care how we get there but I do care that we get something more than at best a quarter measure Not to mention as of right now there are millions of people who just got laid off and lost their healthcare I doubt the plurality of people are so attached to their employer healthcare that they wouldn t trade it for a universal system   gt This is a problem with Democrats  and progressives   I mean not really Progressives candidates unfortunately didn t really start banding together until  the earliest I m willing to wait for the fruits of the labor of the movement to settle in But the Dems election failures under Obama is purely on him and the DNC not progressives    gt The DNC doesn t care if a bunch of progressives win elections they just need to win elections    I d like to think that but Democrats are no longer for the working class Their donors make sure of that They are no longer anti war pro union anti wallstreet anti curroption On the global political scale they are center right and would be a conservative party in other countries So while you may say that the party s interest says otherwise  EDIT I also understand that it s not going to be easy and that it will take work to get progressives in But I m optimistic for now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh hey bot who has really only posted shitty easily disputed researched lies  with links to make it look authentic  gasp  about Bernie Sanders Doing a great job there as a bot  Like I said people who are truly interested in knowing about Bernie should research for themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well at least you have one valid point The defunding of CDC and the streamlined or fired response team But than again It s a hindsight  argument   If you feel better to blame the people on topy just go for it I definitely know that a lot of people with certain viewpoints like to do that   Also I said not a bad job I didn t say a great or a perfect job You can t do that in a situation like this The only county that comes close to that is Taiwan And you can look up what they did  The travel ban argument is just pointing out the hypocricy What about the mistakes the the WHO made The Chinese government People pick a deliberate part in the chain and time of events when they start to blame and say  should ve done that and should ve done more   And it s just stupid to be quite frank  You also act like we already  know how this will turn out We don t You act like we know the outcomes with different measures taken also already We don t   No one believes that fucking conspiracy But a lot of people argue it s the reason why many Asian Countries are doing much better but that measure is not recommended in the west while it could be as good as social distancing or even better Especially with most of the infections being transmitted within families and people you live with If it turns out in retrospective it would ve been the right call should we blame all health officials who didn t advice for it or even against it So they speak even less the next time 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This is of course a post that cheerfully ignores the directly contradiction to her own past statements that it was nothing sexual as well as the progressive increase of salaciousness from  nothing sexual to  touched inappropriately to  raped in a hallway over the years  There were multiple incidents She never mentioned the Rape one until now She has hesitant in even coming out with even the other incidents   The thing you don t understand is that accusation a powerful politician is not easy   She didn t come out with the others until Joe Biden called Lucy Flores a liar for her accusations    gt I get that you re really eager to smear Biden because you re in DSA or whatever but this is remarkably weak  You re resorting to ad hominem   gt Weinstein Ailes and Cosby had multiple accusations stretching decades had multiple allegations corroborated and had enough evidence against them to secure lengthy jail sentences in two of them and I haven t even bothered keeping track of how much money Ailes cost Fox  As stated in my post post there are   Also  uncollaborated accusations too Many women don t ever tell anyone about their rapes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Garry Kasparov has some excellent political takes for a chess player
PoliticalDiscussion,its taxed as income so not a big deal
PoliticalDiscussion,this crisis has proven without a shadow of a doubt that value is created by labor  every dollar of value not paid to the laborer who created it is by definition  extracted 
PoliticalDiscussion,  is not hyperinflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,After the last buying spree in   it ended up peaking at a shade over    The spending rate happening right now is already passed that level of spending and they are expected to spend twice as much in the future at least So one could reasonably expect inflation rates to reach in the   range  To put things in perspective these levels are worst than late WWII    s stagflation era on par with WWI  era levels
PoliticalDiscussion,Here are the ssa gov projects for each of these policy options                       Note the second option  gt Increase the earnings subject to taxation Make all earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax and include these earnings in benefit computations  This would not  fundamentally break SS and its role because the extra payments get included in the benefit calculations the same way they do today  the more you pay in the more you get out  The current payroll cap is also in effect a cap on benefits       This one doesn t have a directly matching policy The closest would be some proposals on   which would increase tax on higher earners without increasing benefits  Also changes to benefit levels on                 Nothing here on immigration
PoliticalDiscussion,is it welfare if I give you  bucks and then ask for k at a later date 
PoliticalDiscussion,Should the benefits cap be removed too then 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well first things first we need to return to a tax system as what we had during the great prosperity then we ll have plenty of tax revenue to maintain  and definitely expand social security 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a great question and can be answered by looking at disability free life expectancy  which has risen along with life expectancy in the United States     To answer your questions what happens when life expectancy gets higher Right now it s just under  years but what if it grows to  or  years Are we to just accept that people will spend another  or  years in retirement Yes youngsters would have to wait longer if retirement ages increase but that s what happens will people are living longer 
PoliticalDiscussion,ETFs have a lot more risk than a savings account
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Oh yeah again with the  secret sexist accusation Can t find anything remotely substantial can you  So the words of his ex staffers aren t  substantial to you  Funny how that only applies to Bernie s campaign   gt No you are not a corporate shill in fact I m not sure if you even aren t a bot by this point  Ah yes  Nobody can ever disagree with Sanders or they re not a real person  Why do you have so much in common with the Trumps      gt Anyone who actually wants to know what Bernie has done could do some googling    Like running his campaign on winning  and expecting actual Democrats to fall in line      Or hiring a noted Twitter troll as a campaign advisor   and letting him spread smears about his opponents   Or publicly accepting and pushing the endorsement of a transphobic and homophobic  personality      There s plenty of things he s done that are more than enough to convince me that he s an asshole or at the very least narcissistic  He could ve pivoted to being a graceful winner after Nevada instead he doubled down on   We re coming for the Democratic establishment     But please continue once again to tell me how Sanders is fighting for me Or begin to do so since you seem to have trouble with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Number  is what I would consider to be the lowest risk and highest reward An American Sovereign Wealth Fund would be a powerful addition to global markets and would easily attract great talent to work for it   When institutions such as Yale and Harvard are able to see double digit returns on their investment portfolio I don t see why the US wouldn t be able to perform as well These schools are often part of the pipeline for people going into the Fed 
PoliticalDiscussion,if you lift the cap on inputs the output cap thats tied to it will also increase offsetting your gains
PoliticalDiscussion,It really depends on the job There s some white collar professional jobs where absolutely you can be productive well into your seventies Loading trucks or wrangling kindergartners Probably not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll have to strongly disagree with you In the entire modern history of politics only three presidential nominees have has multiple accusers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well one thing not mentioned is to have the Government stop stealing from SS and also to pay back all funds it has ever taken from it  Not saying it will save it but will allow it to go for another few years 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And it rewards those who did no saving and banked that social security would always be there  See I m opposed to SS means testing precisely because people feel this way about it The reason that SS is the untouchable third rail of American politics is that  everybody gets a payout If we change it so that the rich pay in but don t pay out all of a sudden the most powerful constituency in politics will be opposed to it and SS will be threatened in a way it never has been before  Social Security works exactly because we ve all got a real stake in it Everybody pays in everybody gets a check in retirement It s an honest to God social program that benefits everyone Let s not screw that up 
PoliticalDiscussion,this is a non answer You just opened the other end by now having huge payouts to high earners So what did you accomplish BOOM
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it turns out the whole notion of an entitlement that you get what you pay into it is politically popular but not a great idea fiscally 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  fair share is based on how much wealth they are extracting now  lol extracting
PoliticalDiscussion,no the caps are tied you would just end up paying out rich people huge amounts
PoliticalDiscussion,For younger generations average lifetime contributions are more than average lifetime benefits 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not a problem anymore  anybody can open a no fee Vanguard account and invest in ETFs to get capital gains treatment   The bigger problem is that Americans don t have enough money to put into any account be it savings or a stock portfolio The average  American household has about   in savings but the median household has something like    
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just because the average age before death increased doesnt mean they are good years What good is SS if you are bedridden or unable to do anything  That s a great question What you re asking about can be answered by looking at the  disability free life expectancy  And in the United States  the disability free life expectancy has gradually risen   along with general life expectancy    gt And what happens when you have a downturn You are also cutting off how the government does a sideways transfer to itself which would require higher taxes   Well much like most funds the bad years would be balanced out by the good And it could be run much like many hedge funds with a focus on absolute returns thus minimizing the effect of downturns Ultimately this isn t a huge financial problem but rather a political problem Sovereign wealth funds like Norway s Alaska s etc all weathered  well but people wouldn t like it if the Trust Fund gets a temporary  hit  Also the loss of the Trust Fund as a buyer of T bills would not have a huge impact on the actual cost for the US it represents a tenth of US debt and interest rates are already chronically low    gt This is just pyramid scheme thinking  All of society is pyramid scheme thinking if you think about it  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The original point of SS was to provide for the bedridden elderly  no
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No that would be a violation of the th amendment Takings clause  Depends on the precise definition of  without just compensation  A  profit margin may be legally sufficient even if a factory s previous product had commanded a  profit margin And I suspect the government can oblige manufacturers to operate at a loss in the short term    ADDED    I should be clear on this I mean the government would need to pay enough to cover variable costs i e  operating costs meaning factor costs electricity other fuels if also used labor including factory management but not fixed costs in the short run  DPA isn t primarily about expense It s about time minimizing delays bypassing  OK eviscerating standard private industry decision process timelines   gt stealing from the workers  Paying factories enough for those factories to make payrolls may not be stealing from workers I figure the government is clever enough to ensure it d only be capital which suffers from DPA commandeering of factories  Finally this isn t fascism at least not my definition 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There can be no investigation   That s false We can investigate the claim a number of ways such as by   Seeking other contemporaneous witnesses who saw or spoke with the alleged victim after the purported attack  Reviewing physical materials that memorialized the event like a diary entry from the time  Auditing expenses related to the alleged attack like medical bills   gt If you are credibly accused of sexual assault you should not hold federal office  That s a big if This person hasn t met the threshold of credible yet In fact the accuser has substantially weakened her case by retroactively purging her social media timeline and by changing the nature of the story   Does that mean it s false Of course not and the dynamic of sexual assaults makes those crimes more likely to feature shifting stories But that doesn t exactly explain the accuser s enthusiasm for Russia  Nevertheless it weakens credibility espe  We can look to what happened with the Dominique Strauss Kahn accusations to see what s likely to happen when the accuser self destructs their own credibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its basically a state mandated pyramid scheme You need people younger on the bottom to pay into the system so the people at the top retirees can benefit from it If you dont have enough people pay into the system it starts to fall apart   gt I pay into it my whole life I fully expect to get it when I m old   I might not want to pay taxes into a system that I might not really benefit from You better damn well know that if I am forced to pay taxes into such a system I am going to take the portion I am entitled to  This is why it is nearly impossible to to change the system The only people that might be willing to change it are the younger generations because they wouldnt be nearly invested into such a system yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,but the cap is tied to the pay out cap Lift one and the other matches
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean I do invest myself but in smaller ways There s a lot that s getting streamlined with social security whereas there s no guarantee you as an individual are going to be able to save your money and move its value with inflation as to not lose money I suppose everyone would have to start mutual funds in a world without social security Even then something seems risky about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,all of them
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  But society exists to protect the vulnerable from those that would cast them aside  nobody is casting anyone aside You take your  and do what you want and ill do the same   gt have a comfortable home and am a white male in a society that gives white males a lot of slack  lol go sell your white guilt somewhere else please
PoliticalDiscussion,No that is just to fix the long term solvancy SSI was designed as the third leg of retirement the and as longevity insurance against grandma being  destitute It is an annuity that is about  less expensive than anything the private market offers  The debt is the overhang from the original recipients the ones who did not pay in Should the program be expanded Yes most Americans are terrible at handling their retirement  as illustrated be the retirement crisis we are currently in 
PoliticalDiscussion,whats absurd is either your blatant misinformation about caps or your extremely poor understanding of the cap and how it directly related to they payout cap Those high earners are already subsidizing SS as they get the worst of the deal due to the bend point structure 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh what happened to your comment about  friends  Too immature for even you Oh yeah again with the  secret sexist accusation for someone who was named  honorary woman  Can t find anything remotely substantial can you No you are not a corporate shill in fact I m not sure if you even aren t a bot by this point Everything you ve written are  exact repeated lies Anyone who actually wants to know what Bernie has done could do some googling   You continue to do what you are paid to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Expense is secondary Quick is primary and fundamental In true emergencies no time to spare so letting private industry decide on their own in their usual timelines isn t ideal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know a lot of people that don t save any money because they would lose their healthcare In order to qualify for Medicaid in my state you have to have less than  in cash   Healthcare for my family via my employer is  mo   That creates a definite welfare cliff 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here we can agree  Eliminating the cap and means testing the recipients will save the program 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not to mention the SSN aspect of it as well Wasnt meant to be used as federal ID but it actually is Why we cant get an official Federal ID system I place is beyond me when the states actually have their own systems 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Literally no one who knows Bernie could say with conscience that he is an asshole   You sure about that      gt He fought for justice and for vulnerable people all his life  He passed  one notable bill and renamed two post offices  Walk the walk   gt He read every page of the bills to make sure they don t stuff shit provisions in there to screw over the people  Really  Proof of that   gt He worked on bills and then took his name out so they would be passed   citation needed   It  is the best excuse I ve ever seen Sanders supporters offer for the fact that in  years he s passed a grand total of  bills   gt He is  years old a vulnerable target for the virus and he still goes to the Senate to fight for the workers  Funny that he couldn t actually be bothered to show up and you know do his job then  He didn t miss an opportunity to grandstand and take credit though   gt He worked all his life for people like you undereducated angry and misinformed individuals so you could have a better quality of life  He s done almost no work his entire life  He s been a perennial ideologue and backbencher who can t even when running for president stop attacking the party  he supposedly wants to lead   But yes tell me how he s working for me by calling me a corporate shill and  establishment  please   gt But you carry on being you I have no doubt you would reply me in bad faith People like you don t want to take in new information You want to attack belittle and conquer for whatever illusion of power that gets you Meanwhile the progressives will actually work for the betterment of all our lives We pity toxic persons like you  Projection it s not just for conservatives any more 
PoliticalDiscussion,The paper you linked is about welfare traps in Uruguay not the US  In fact the introductory discussion in this paper notes it s not a well researched field but that some studies have shown evidence of a welfare trap   gt Among the first group of studies there is previous work in the US on the labor market impacts of Food Stamps  Currie  and Hoynes and Schanzenbach  review this literature  currently called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  SNAP  While initial work on this topic  Hangstrom  Fraker and Moffitt  shows practically no evidence of work disincentives recent work has found some evidence in particular among single women  East  Williamson and Whitmore     gt      gt Baicker et al   studies whether Medicaid increases participation in Food Stamps TANF Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance and finds a positive and statistically significant impact on enrollment in Food Stamps The UCT program in Uruguay seems to impact enrollment in the opposite direction
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  That still acts as a disincentive through diminishing returns 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt large numbers  Poverty rates among the elderly were    prior to social security   gt Wich would be one thing however forcing me to save for you is another  Well we re just circling back to your mostly worthless ideology ignoring the consequences of your beliefs is just dumb If your moral code says that granny opening up a bag of Iams for dinner is okay because at least you weren t forced to give her a few bucks for supper then you ve fucked up 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So people calculate how much they stand to earn and what effect that will have on the benefits they receive    Some people already kind of do that before taking on a promotion and higher salary and may reject it They incorrectly assume they might pay more in taxes by going into a higher tax bracket Let s say they make k and pay  in taxes but if they make k they get bumped up into a new tax bracket and pay   They incorrectly assume they pay  on all their income They actually still pay  on the first k and  on the difference so on the extra k 
PoliticalDiscussion,large numbers   gt by forcing people to pay into retirement accounts for their old age  Wich would be one thing however forcing me to save for you is another
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed If you pay in you should get money back out But the cap also needs to be removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Remove the payroll cap It s absolutely ludicrous that the wealthiest people the people most able to help are given a pass regarding their contribution    There are many many executives who max out their SS contribution  on their first paycheck of the year  It s so beyond absurd that I don t know the word to describe how absurd it is 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Immigration only increases total GDP it doesn t increase GDP per capita In fact it actually reduces GDP per capita growth slightly   Do you have a source for that  It seems like it isn t as clean cut as you suggest   
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course it s an investment the SS fund gets its money back with interest The  both sides element is only relevant inasmuch as it means that Congress could just eliminate Social Security but they could whether SS invested in treasury bonds or something else  either way the funds would revert to the general fund 
PoliticalDiscussion,Instead of the Government taking  of your check and throwing it in a proverbial fire just save that money yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a hell of a lot easier to build an M Sherman than a modern ventilator And switching a  automotive plant to build tanks or aircraft is a much different proposition than changing a  GM factory to make medical equipment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure but they lose value during downturns which is when people need the money  A few months expenses emergency fund should be established before investing and that belongs in something safe and easily liquidable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security spending comes directly from the Social Security payroll tax Anything not covered by the payroll tax comes from the Trust Fund These taxes pass through the federal government because that s how Social Securitu is administered but they are specifically earmarked for Social Security and that hasn t changed   That Social Security is often lumped into general spending for illustrative purposes is immaterial 
PoliticalDiscussion,They can do that a lot faster than someone that doesn t make the devices can get that amount of inventory online  Larger companies that make it will shift around their production which is how eg M is dramatically increasing production of face masks They ll be able to ramp up production way faster than say Ford could turn that amount of production around 
PoliticalDiscussion,From the General Budget  of Mandatory Spending is Social Security If Social Security has its own money then why is  of Mandatory Spending coming from General Revenue and not the Trust Fund      
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh yea he s also  a rapist   yet the MSM is ignoring it And before even commenting on it listen to the actual tape otherwise I won t even respond 
PoliticalDiscussion,They can t just double their manufacturing capacity 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Here s a real truth for you Millions of average Americans would of already received a thousand   check from the government to pay their bill s with if the democratic party would of passed the bill  None of that is true   The Republican Bill was means tested so that only those earning over  k would get   The average household would get     And it created a slush fund with no oversight The GOP helps billionaires the Dems help the people    gt I am being civil You being daft is a appropriate description of your willful ignorance and lies  About as civil as that lying asshole in the White House 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is so incredibly wrong it hurts   Those  Congressional IOUs the Trust Fund is filled with are Treasury Bonds Congress pays them back with interest regularly In fact the Trust Fund sees annual returns of nearly  billion on these bonds If you think this is stealing from Social Security then we must be stealing from the Chinese and Japanese governments because they own more of these bonds than Social Security does The Post Office is a non sequitur because it is a completely different situation   You clearly have no idea how the Social Security Trust Fund works 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except SS also provides benefits for the disabled not just to retired folks Out of the options given I would support  and    The rest come with stipulations  and  would pretty much fix the problem with SS 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Raise the eligibility age  gt    I agree with everything except the first one There is no need to raise the age or retirement   If one is concerned about Social Security one must first ask   Where is Social Security s money  Answer  in the pockets of Congress    Did you ever not ask why if Social Security has its own money is it then being paid from General Revenue  Congress stole all the money for their pet projects though they will say they borrowed it The Social Security Trust Fund is filled with Congressional IOU s But now that the money is gone and spent Congress is no longer content to keep paying the money back That is like buying a house and half way through the mortgage saying that you don t want to pay any more but you want to keep the house   Congress did the same thing in an attempt to break the Post Office they put impossible demand for health care and pensions literally require the pension for people who had not even been born yet to be funded   But here is the kicker that impossible amount of money could not be held in a private trust by the Post Office it had to be held in general revenue where Congress could rob it blind Let me guess when the Post Office employee go to collect the money Congress is going to say   Oops its gone too bad   That is precisely what is happening with Social Security they stole all the money and they have no interest in paying it back    There is really nothing wrong with Social Security that a few minor tweak couldn t cure and you probably suggested the best of them   BUT   Congress doesn t want to fix it they want to break it because they don t want to keep paying the Money back And they would prefer a more PROFIT based system where you end up with little or nothing and their buddies make a fortune managing the system   This applies to so many issue but Social Security   Post Office Health Care Welfare etc      are not broken The broken spoke in the wheel is CONGRESS THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIX How can Congress have a  favorability rating yet they keep getting elected again and again In my opinion both the Right and the Left are irredeemably corrupt and we need to get rid of them  CONGRESS not Social Security is the problem that needs to be fixed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s two fold   First Trump s main legacy would be a good economy so using the defense production act could put more stress more debt on our economic system Nobodies paying the companies enough to produce those goods and their expenses are high while income is low   Second would be his advisors cautioning him against it because it would go against the general ideology of his base as far as the corona virus is concerned he s been consistent about limiting the necessity of federal government 
PoliticalDiscussion,I watched  The Mayfair Set by Adam Curtis I don t want social security trust fund managers to start directing the economy  for our benefit and basically crush the workers for profit even more including mass overseas outsourcing and even asset stripping companies for immediate profit at the expense of our very livelihoods 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not 
PoliticalDiscussion,not in the long run
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for starters The US Federal Government can stop using it as a general funds charge account  Regardless of the viability of the fund and and every call to privatize it is either misguided or an attempt at blatant and pernicious theft of the public s wealth 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ooooh  scary  Just like I said 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ask Zimbabwe how just printing extra money worked out for them Or Venezuela or  s Germany 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand how you feel I question if he ll be held accountable as well I m treating it like my fear of what will happen when my daughter is a teenager and just categorizing it as a  we ll cross that road when we come to it situation There s so much going on right now in our personal lives with COVID already just try to manage what you can so you don t get overwhelmed stressing about the what ifs I believe in some kind of karma like payback and that man has done so much that the universe will balance it back out for him in some way Sending love to you in these trying times lt 
PoliticalDiscussion,Adjust that for inflation and you lose a good third of the value And I still don t know anyone who is going game their  figure job for that   Moreover lets get to the heart of the matter There are people who have real need and people who simply don t We should progressively tax and transfer some portion of wealth from the very successful to those who have nothing Most people agree Most people don t avoid making more money just knowing they will be taxed more 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is zero chance that Biden will cut social security  Then explain his comments not even quite  years ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,We can get rid of it If the people receiving SS payments just put it in a bank account or the stock market they d make far more than they get back from Social security 
PoliticalDiscussion,Side discussion What are people s thoughts regarding the OP question when you take into account that when SS was established it was meant to cover  accidental life past the average life expectancy at the time which was around  The benefit was by definition a  safety net and it only affected a tiny population   Today s life expectancy is almost  our aging population has grown exponentially and SS is considered more of a retirement benefit than a survival safety net 
PoliticalDiscussion,We would be far better off Vastly better 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they are following the law I don know what you mean by  on paper  As far as I m concerned the law is the part on paper 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the government would simply give me all the money I ve paid in thus far today with reasonable interest I d never have to work another day in my life   And I m nowhere near retirement age 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That s not a problem anymore  anybody can open a no fee Vanguard account and invest in ETFs to get capital gains treatment  There are millions of low income people who have no idea about this kind of thing So while most technically have access they don t have the education or opportunity that puts them in a place to just know that this is a thing And millions are also living paycheck to paycheck and really don t have the money to put into this kind of thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,You haven t actually contradicted anything I ve said So what are we arguing about  You re worried about the buying power of a dollar I m talking about how to provide food and shelter to senior citizens  It s true I m not very concerned about inflation It s been below  target for most of my life It seems like a scary story that politicians tell citizens to justify suffering 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do mean by  borrowing  
PoliticalDiscussion,So your only good with the welfare for the rich but not the poor What about the welfare trap of bailout out short sighted reckless companies who after years of record profita run out of cash within weeks of a event happening Fire up that money printer We can t have any rich people having to go through bankruptcy now xan we They might have to sell a yacht for half what they paid for it    god no say it isnt so    Mitch McConnell the great image of fiscal responsibility  of the masses has been loosing sleep wheeling barrows full of cash to the poor downtrodden elite Maybe you should go after that than worrying about a small Social Security underfunding that feeds the vast majority of retirees 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I simply think Biden wants to cut SS as evidenced by his older comments as well as recent ones  You are wrong There is zero chance that Biden will cut social security 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just remove the cap  And refuse to make mandatory payments into the fund mandatory No  borrowing  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but why bother If you want to break the relationship with pay in to pay out just scrap it all and give out welfare checks  a mixture of people being too dumb to save for retirement and diversify properly  but also because society is nothing more than humans teaming up to make a better life for everyone   You re using a smart phone and or computer  Did you mine the materials process them design it build it code the OS code every single one of your own apps     No of course not you benefited from living in a society   there s a huge amount of jobs performed by everyone that makes all of our lives better    unless you want to go live in the woods off grid in a log cabin you built from scratch you need to have a mindset that you constantly benefit from the work of others    gt Yes he just lost   of his income and will get nothing for it as promised   Nope        so he would get  million a year instead of     clearly he would be fine       and actually the design goal was welfare  it created after the great depression and soup lines were started those people needed well fair but there was none   you need to remember  inflation   because we can t prediction inflation over someone s  or  years of working  it s setup so you earn credits and get paid out loosely based on credits and loosely based on your earnings       Though i see what you are getting at  and yes UBI would be vastly Superior to a complicated well fair  SS program   I understand the desire to keep  of your income and say fuck everyone else  tell them to keep  working jobs like trash collector cashier star bucks person so i can have a great life and only think of myself   but it turns out  i m just not that greedy    shrugs  
PoliticalDiscussion,Pelosi isn t doing remote voting because she s older than Biden but because of her ego  She was not content with having a ceremonial weapon that can be used to forcibly silence Representatives but had to have regalia fashioned after that tool It would be akin to Queen Elizabeth II had a crown made out of naval vessels 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security hasn t been  used for other things  though 
PoliticalDiscussion,A few years in no way invalidates a decades long growth in life expectancies 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt   Welfare trap is an unfounded neoliberal talking point  This is not a coherent statement 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Absurd I have a very average lifestyle and household net worth and this single change would push my marginal tax rate above   And that s before we get to funding UBI free college free iPhones free healthcare and whatever else people who think  the rich don t pay their fair share want  gt   gt You simply have no sense of how much high earners are paying in taxes  oh no  not a    marginal   tax rate of   whatever shall you do  if this  pushes you into that higher bracket then the actual amount you are paying at that higher bracket cant be more than a few thousand  this is the definition of privilege you dont give a fuck about people suffering if giving a fuck means you have to be a little less well off 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I wasn t talking about Bernie but progressive candidates in general  Maybe Bernie should ve used his massive fundraising apparatus to help other candidates   This is one of my principle criticisms with Bernie he s largely sat on the sidelines for most of his career and he s wondering  why the Democratic Party has become the way they are  I mean if you aren t willing to help them fundraise and sponsor progressive candidates who are you to criticize  Democrats have to make a calculated decision about who to support and recent history suggests moderate candidates far outperform progressive ones  and the primary this year are indicative of those trends It is a fact that moderate candidates delivered the House to Democrats   As we ve already demonstrated progressives did not do well Blame billionaires and Democrats all you want but maybe there is something else to all this   gt Now I will criticize that he didn t change strategy when the established Democrats coalesced  My man this was the  entirety of his campaign hope the field was fractured and win a  plurality   You re telling me with the largest fundraising grassroots army your plan is   hope other people spoil the primary for you  Dude that s a criminally negligent plan He didn t even try to expand his coalition   Are you really surprised his numbers are worse than  It s time to hold Bernie accountable He is an awful face for progressives and I m glad AOC is moving a different direction    gt But I don t see the media criticizing Obama on the genocide in Yemen  Oh You don t remember the criticism Obama got for drone strikes What about the criticism he got for spending  Do you hear the media talking about the deficit anymore Do you hear anyone skipping a beat over this two trillion dollar stimulus  Why did Obama and Democrats get all that criticism while Trump and Republicans get a free pass   It s time for progressives to realize the media narratives are dictated by Republicans    gt But your article is from September  Yes when Biden was the front runner See what happens when a candidate is in the spotlight The exact same thing happened to Bernie and everyone cried fowl No it comes with the territory   And it s harder for Democrats than Republicans    gt For example Biden said he could not empathize with young people s problems  Here is what Biden said   The younger generation now tells me how tough things are Give me a break No no I have no empathy for it Give me a break  Biden  told The Los Angeles Times earlier this week     Because here s the deal guys we decided we were gonna change the world And we did We did We finished the civil rights movement in the first stage The women s movement came to be    he continued       So my message is get involved     And guess what young people aren t doing Getting involved Biden was right  Quit complaining and start voting Start campaigning And the youth didn t heed Bernie s call    gt the point of the bill is to give maximum leverage because last thing we need is to concede to public option before the battle begins and just get Obamacare  Leverage over who Mitch McConnel I keep hearing once Bernie starts negotiating with him he ll start at MA and settle for something else   Listen the only way to negotiate with Mitch is to beat his fucking ass at the polls Republicans don t give a shit They aren t for reform at all They aren t for compromising This is the game they have perfected  We must crush them at the polls    gt I mean not really Progressives candidates unfortunately didn t really start banding together until  the earliest I m willing to wait for the fruits of the labor of the movement to settle in But the Dems election failures under Obama is purely on him and the DNC not progressives  Everyone s fault but our own  I started this conversation by taking responsibility for my failures I failed to vote in    That s on me   I hope progressives eventually take ownership And no the progressive movement didn t begin in  Bernie is not the father of progressivism    gt I d like to think that but Democrats are no longer for the working class Their donors make sure of that  And it s this brazen untruth that will continue to fracture progress Republicans are giddily ripping regulations and the courts to pieces while liberals progressive and democrats squabble over purity politics   Mitch McConnell laughs about this stuff  Just Win Elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t even understand basic economics   Yes all money is made up But it is made up at a sustainable rate of around  inflation per year If we suddenly started making up trillions of dollars our currency would be devalued   Because  if we are just making up as much money as we want no one would want to invest in our country   if money is infinite no one would want to accept it   Yes we  make up money But as stated above it is done at a rate that doesn t make it over abundant If we just made up money for whenever we didn t have enough it would be devalued 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt no because there would still be a huge range of possible payout depending on your lifetime income  but why bother If you want to break the relationship with pay in to pay out just scrap it all and give out welfare checks   gt Would this cause people earning k a year to pitch in disproportionately more than they get out yes it would  they already do   gt is lebon james gonna have a bad retirement becuase of this No  Yes he just lost   of his income and will get nothing for it as promised   gt so what s your problem with the plan  It breaks the promise that SS was sold as If we want to just soak the rich and hand out checks then just say so Why go through the hassle and expense of tracking everything Just do means tested welfare and done   gt Government will never pay out benefits directly as you pay them in  Well they did initially to sell it to the suckers   gt that s just not the design goal nor should it be as that doesn t make any sense  the design goal was for individual accounts not welfare
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes looming disaster It s highly unlikely these human work driven countries will be able to smoothly handle the transition to a robot work driven society and make the massive welfare reforms needed beforehand And we don t have a lot of time to do so I m not saying the world is going to end We ll eventually reset with massive reforms but it s going to be really bad for the economy and a ton of people for some time 
PoliticalDiscussion,People aren t actually really living longer US life expectancy has declined for the past yrs
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So it won t actually go bust unless the party forming the government decides not to support it and lets it die which is a political choice but not an inevitability Otherwise the government can use a mix of reducing payouts  The issue that I have is that the government isn t some separate entity It is society meaning society would be paying these costs and largely is would be the younger generations I believe that the older wealthier boomers who profited off of having extra money on hand by not fixing this should be the ones to pay for the missing benefits at this time For the future we need to add more taxes to balance things out Others have also suggesting broadening out investment strategy which I am also in favor of 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup and I m in that tax increase bracket  I d be subjecting about triple my income to it  It s called living in a society and giving a shit about my fellow human beings  If you want to not give a shit then go live on your own somewhere and not rely on anyone else in a cabin in the woods 
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually it s a great idea unless you don t save the money and use it for other things 
PoliticalDiscussion,no because there would still be a huge range of possible payout depending on your lifetime income      Would this cause people earning k a year  to pitch in disproportionately more than they get out  yes it would  Is lebon james gonna have a bad retirement becuase of this  No  would my friend s who make K  K suffer greatly  No would my friends making k k benefit directly yes as the system would be solvent would it even impact any of their retirement lifestyles   No  so what s your problem with the plan    Government will never pay out benefits directly as you pay them in   that s just not the design goal nor should it be  as that doesn t make any sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly  Have you saved Social Security if all you did in the end was change it to another form of welfare  That doesn t seem like saving it but simply creating a different system 
PoliticalDiscussion,No   All money is made up  Every dollar comes from the federal government Most dollars don t even exist as hard currency they re just records in accounting systems More dollars have been made by keystrokes than printing presses  Making up money by itself does not cause  hyper inflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,so turn SS into welfare Then why have an SSA at all Why bother when you can just say apply for welfare at 
PoliticalDiscussion,Everyone was  too late to prepare not just America China was able to slap down hospitals in a week because  building codes That shit just gets in the way    I ll agree on free testing and critical care as long as the costs are open to avoid it being used as a way to funnel taxpayer money to companies owned by BFFs of Congressmen  Rent freezes cannot be legally done at a federal level but can be done at a state level  I m against continued closure The longer America is locked down the more damage it does to the economy we have to return to This means fewer jobs and more poverty which will make the next pandemic even harder on America 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you saying the maximum benefit paid out would also increase   well we could cap that   easy peasy lemon squeezy   but thanks for pointing that out   
PoliticalDiscussion,Absurd I have a very average lifestyle and household net worth and this single change would push my marginal tax rate above   And that s before we get to funding UBI free college free iPhones free healthcare and whatever else people who think  the rich don t pay their fair share want  You simply have no sense of how much high earners are paying in taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,You realize that just making up money causes hyper inflation right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ya thats definitely true
PoliticalDiscussion,Then sue me for using a term of narrative convenience If you weren t being pedantic as all hell it should have been apparent what I meant as this is a pretty common usage for discussing when something in practice differs from the ideal it s based on 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are literally the only person in this thread who has tried to make this  paper distinction and now you transparently have tried to claim you never actually meant on paper this entire time 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You realize this is what it means to be part of society right  not society     This is a ridiculous answer We have had societies for thousands of years and only had forced pension savings for  lt  Not to mention the point that SS is an individualized program as in you have a personalized leger with credits and amounts You get your payout based on what YOU put in etc This isn t supposed to be some societal tax like income where its redistributive   gt Are you also going to argue that why your taxes are being used to create roads in another state that you will likely never drive on used on public k schools when you don t plan on having kids spent on paying paramedics when you don t ever expect to get into an accident  why yes   gt Libertarianism is a dead ideology  if you say so   gt You have the option to renounce your citizenship and become stateless if you hate paying taxes so much  Just like a battered wife should just leave with only the clothes on her back right   gt Let me know how that works out for ya  I do plan to move out of the country once I have minimized all taxes and retire early so not too much longer now
PoliticalDiscussion,It is more likely to be a matter of those with the funds to get lawyers to help them game the system  i e the   still getting benefits while a large portion of actual middle class gets screwed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Looming disaster With the current pace of advancement in technology I am willing to bet we can automate most of the jobs before we ever get to the tipping point 
PoliticalDiscussion,First using the DPA is a form of non military conscription Nobody wants the draft even if you aren t going to shoot people and or die in nowherestan  Second the factories are by nature not going to engage in good social distancing It s loud and people need to communicate but to work and to relax during work Invoking the DPA is going to get people in factories getting each other sick  Ford and FCA would have been easily  convinced to produce stuff without invoking the DPA as Ford was the largest producer of the MB Jeep during WW and FCA owns  part of Jeep 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tyrrany of the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,STOP STEALING FROM IT  Honestly all the models I have seen  if we stop stealing from it to make up deficits caused by tax breaks for the  and nearby it would be fine  So get that tax back in the system make capitol gains the SAME as income  if we value work as much as we pretend we would not push work and reward NOT work at the same level and replenish what was stolen  It would not even be an issue if both sides stopped using it as a slush fund 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re clearly way more invested in this than I am so I ll leave it at this  Social Security was sold to the American public as a continuation of the war bonds program started in WWII which absolutely and explicitly had individualized accounts via the bonds you held  Whether or not that understanding ever made it into codified law that is what the public was told they were getting  Your quibble appears to be my statement  on paper as this understanding may never have made it onto paper literally But I will absolutely and steadfastly maintain that Americans thought they had individual accounts  by some metric  and nobody ever disabused them of that notion Modern social security probably would not have been able to pass even if the changes we ve made since then have been functional and necessary Maybe you d chill the hell out if I reworded it to say  everyone was told they d get out what they put in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Vote out republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Vox did a more complete  why are people talking about this type write up on the situation so that s probably why it s the one getting shared The intercept only reported on it indirectly presumably to as a way to get it out there without standing behind Reade s claims 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Social Security Trust Fund would probably be much larger than it is today given average returns 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re volunteering  of the population for a pretty dramatic tax increase 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Wich would be one thing however forcing me to save for you is another   You realize this is what it means to be part of society right Are you also going to argue that why your taxes are being used to create roads in another state that you will likely never drive on used on public k schools when you don t plan on having kids spent on paying paramedics when you don t ever expect to get into an accident  Libertarianism is a dead ideology You have the option to renounce your citizenship and become stateless if you hate paying taxes so much Let me know how that works out for ya 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if the law is silent on the non existent individualized savings accounts then surely they didn t exist on paper like you ve claimed The tax collection portion is contained at Title VII and Title VIII and also says nothing about individualized accounts I ve read all three sections and nothing mentioned supports anything you ve said regarding an individual account 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t get me wrong Going to a sound monetary policy will fix the root cause of the issue in the long run but it won t repair the damage that has already been done Increasing contributions and lowering costs is the only way to do that   We really need housing to be affordable People should not be stuck paying on mortgages when they nearing retirement age 
PoliticalDiscussion, is a terrible idea Let s buy risky assets Where would we be today if that was the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree But within the context of the current situation Democrats also have reason to be pleased  Trumps rally numbers aren t good  But you re right Dems have work to do This election is not a given at all 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Quite literally the only thing I learned is that you quite literally have no idea what you are talking about  gt   gt   yes I see how you refuted nothing   gt Let me guess You are a trump supporting Republican That wasn t a question  lol another swing and a miss  congrats on hitting the cap btw  oh and I see you allow your kids to keep aggressive dogs and then want to try to bail her out of trouble when it kills another one I hope they sue the shit out of you people
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt It very clearly was never an individualized account and you even admit that the law doesn t say it was thus you are wrong  The section you quoted is actually silent on that It would depend substantially on other portions of the law as well as regulations created around it If you want to quote the law at people you should learn how to read what it says not extrapolate beyond that   I didn t read the entire bill and I assume neither did you but that specific section is not sufficient to prove either of us correct  Edit hell the  very next section which discusses early death payouts implies my stance to be correct Which is why trying to fisk laws especially very old ones isn t super smart most of the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Australia has a mandatory system with payments at a minimum of  of pay Most private pensions are managed by non profit mutual funds with each industry typically having a large mutual for its workers These funds are also taxed at a low level with tax incentives to encourage voluntary contributions into your fund   With this system when you reach retirement you get your money back plus a fuck load of interst while under SS you get less than what you paid in
PoliticalDiscussion,Look it was either on paper an individual retirement account and you were right or it wasn t like that on paper people just thought it was and you are wrong   It very clearly was never an individualized account and you even admit that the law doesn t say it was thus you are wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Quite literally the only thing I learned is that you quite literally have no idea what you are talking about    Let me guess You are a trump supporting Republican That wasn t a question 
PoliticalDiscussion,You missed the second part that directly addresses your point  You quoted a section to me that has absolutely nothing to do with how the money should be spent only how much should be allocated to people This is not the same  People were sold on the  idea of Social Security being individual accounts and even if the law never spelled out that there should be an account for an individual with their lifetime payments retained  or at least tracked  that s what everyone was told when they were rallying support for the law That s also the explicit basis for the War Bonds program that SSA grew out of  How explicitly the executed that understanding doesn t mean that wasn t what everyone thought they were getting when they set it up and it has changed substantially in the interim  the SSA being  allowed to invest in treasury bonds was a substantial shift in policy  a good one in my mind   Either way this is pointless bickering about something that hasn t existed in the  promised state in  years by my argument or ever by yours 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing Social Security is sustainable Government should stop borrowing from it Remove caps from income 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep it civil Do not personally insult other Redditors or make racist sexist homophobic or otherwise discriminatory remarks Constructive debate is good mockery taunting and name calling are not

PoliticalDiscussion,The US can t function with a sovereign wealth fund given the size of the economy and influence of its currency on world markets 
PoliticalDiscussion,It took years to get to that level with those things they aren t fast The new carriers still struggling even after release 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately we live in a world where conservatives have tried multiple times to weaponize allegations of this nature as a political smear If you re judging somebody off of an  accusation  then your only principle is a rush to judgment 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll make you a deal for the last years i have paid almost  of my income into Social security and my employer paid the same amount into Social Security  An amount  to  of my income has been withheld from for  years If you write me a check for the entire amount   compounding interest from day one Once it clears and i have the cash in my hand i will forgoe any future social security payments   Otherwise i will fight like a clan  of angry badgers against anyone who tries to stop me from receiving my promised benefits    years of hard physical labor left me broke down but I am still a better man than  of what I see walkig around today 
PoliticalDiscussion,No they just vote to move money from the Trust Fund to orher noble endeavors like wars 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also called democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can we instead   not  save it I d rather us just simply transition to it being a welfare system for the elderly and disabled Where we aren t paying out benefits to those that don t need it Where low income earners  don t have to pay into it Where the payroll tax  on the  employee side  is reduced to increase income It should be funded in an entirely different way as payroll taxes simply disincentivize wage growth and employment   Why is a tax on employment of   something people seem to be fine with Especially on low income earners That could be using the time value of money to be furthering their education avoid interest debt keep better credit scores etc  All the things to help them through their lives rather than handing them money when they are old because the govenrment stripped them of any ability to prosper on their own At  best  it takes  years to break even after taking benefits And with a lower life expectancy that already places the poor past their life expectancy Why is this program so blessed by everyone  The solution to  save it  would be to simply draw revenue from another source There s no reason why it must only come from payroll taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,The DNC will not allow their candidate to step down the night before the election and let the incumbent run uncontested Why do you have that much faith in humanity That people won t compromise their values just so their horse can win 
PoliticalDiscussion,The second you make a federal ID it will get tied to everything Want to enroll in school Show your ID Want to work Copy of your ID please Want to drive ID  I would think Republicans would love a National ID that can be used to ensure that those whose presence here is less than legal cannot access services 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have watched the video the full hour long bit  He didn t seem like he was being sarcastic to me  Politifact in this instance is merely repeating the words of the Biden campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security costs are rising because the population is getting older The returns from the Treasury bonds held by the Social Security Trust Fund cover inflation It is a non issue  Moreover Austrian economics is heterodox quackery 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politicians are not stealing from the Social Security Trust Fund this is a common misconception In a sense the US does borrow from it in that the Trust Fund is only allowed to invest the money in special issue Treasury Bonds but these are paid back regularly with interest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why save it I would love to see it go away I am planning for my retirement as if it didn t exist and everyone else under  should also
PoliticalDiscussion,Stop electing Republicans Period SS is safe 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree completely Social Security has basic mathematical formulas its has nothing to do with what people need It has everything to do with Social Security paying out to millions of people who never paid into it   Gen X may be smaller but the millennial generation is the largest generation yet and the follow on generations are almost as large For the last several years the avg Life span in the USA has been falling which will help somewhat   If congress would eliminate the maximum income that is taxed to fund Social Security it would cover almost  of the shortages if nothing else changed As Boomers die off the smaller gen X generation will not be drawing as much from the system so the larger follow on generations will be building a surplus during that time     For people who spend their lives on Social security disability they should have to show they ares still disabled at least every other year   Some people may no longer be able to build bridges but that doesn t mean they couldn t learn a desk job and earn their own income in another way  At the very most a   tax increase AND eliminating the income limit on Social Security taxes while stopping the deadbeats from collecting  our nation could make Social Security solvent well into the nd century
PoliticalDiscussion,We do not steal from the Social Security Trust Fund this is a common misconception In a sense the US does borrow from it in that the Trust Fund is only allowed to invest the money in special issue Treasury Bonds but these are paid back regularly with interest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Congress does not steal from Social Security This is a common misconception not actually backed up by fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right he could say that because Trump is worse in every way  Then he can step down    because its not about Biden being President   its about Trump being gone But you re wrong about why I want Trump gone its not because he s not on my team   I had no teams tll he was President   Trump is an evil man and he needs to go Call me a hypocrite if you believe that but it really comes down to the greater good and removing Trump serves that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Complete Takeover Didn t she sail already 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the modern Republican party can win in   Yes predictions of the GOPs death are a dime a dozen but they re working against the clock demographically  Trump won because of record turnout among rural whites not because of an expanded coalitions Rural whites are still on the decline as are older whites Trump was a candidate who tapped into rural white paleoconservatism in a way other candidates can t   By  the demographics will be so dem leaning it d be irrelevant Either the GOP becomes a permanent  well until the next realignment minority party like the Dems were post civil war for a while or they reform to attract more minorites which is actually not too far fetched imo If they dropped the immigration hardballing and moderated their economic stances they can easily attract fiscally liberal socially conservative Hispanic voters
PoliticalDiscussion,Politicians have never  raided the Social Security Trust Fund This is a common misconception Social Security funding has always been kept separate from discretionary spending 
PoliticalDiscussion,The federal government has never  stolen from Social Security This is a common misconception 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security has always been in a separate account The change in LBJ was just a formal accounting change no money actually moved This is a common misconception unfortunately one perpetuated by politicians on both sides of the aisle 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security is entirely funded by payroll taxes These taxes have never been cut save for increases in the cap to match inflation 
PoliticalDiscussion,The best way to save S S is to vote for Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,  False     You are spreading misinformation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree Cap payout to what was paid in  on a generational level  The Boomers voted for   tax cuts  edit increases in benefits without increases to funding they can reap the rewards If they want to retroactively fund SS for themselves an Elizabeth Warren style x cent wealth tax on retirees gets my vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah people are drawing comparisons to this and Ford when Fords character was a big part of her credibility  Meanwhile Reade has revised her claim multiple times is obviously politically against Biden and pro Bernie and theres ample reason to suspect a connection to Russia
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah very good points Maybe I m a pessimist but I think the GOP in Florida will do everything they can to chop up or delay the ex felon reenfranchisement like they re doing now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did that bill ever get any traction I haven t heard of it at all
PoliticalDiscussion,The whole point though is that if we lift the k cap  or whatever it is the  pyramid scheme does start to work    gt Most people like this solution simply because it doesn t affect them  Cool that s democracy People making more money should be taxed in order to help the many They ll just have to deal with one less mercedes and maybe not have a vacation home Good Fuck  em Taxes are a great weapon to use against selfish wealth hoarders if only more politicians had the balls to actually do it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I will lose all respect for Sanders if he continues campaigning 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The best bet here is to define a number of years from life expectancy and set it based on that to be updated for each cohort  Would this be the same for everyone or any sort of split between male female or race The current system gives lots of money to white asian and women due to living longer and less to male and black hispanic I ve thought of doing this before but not sure if it should be done And then why not consider other factors like smoking or obesity or cancer Well maybe you shouldn t consider those nor anything  Also I don t like the idea of raising the age As less work is needed to have people live comfortably people retiring earlier living longer I think is a nice natural way to sort of balance that out instead of just increasing unemployment  Also unrelated to SS but so too would increasing vacation weeks lowering full time hours   gt remove the cap on payroll taxes currently the SS payroll tax is capped at   in income benefiting only the highest earners Remove this cap or if that s too much for people at the very least implement a more progressive bracket   gt Means test benefits reducing the benefits for the highest earners with the most saved already can go a long way toward solvency Moreover this can be coupled with more generous benefits for lower income recipients  This seems odd to me SS is supposed to the more you put in the more you get out And I also wouldn t want to disincentivize people from saving money by then just giving them less SS And I definitely don t want people who have planned for getting SS money for    years to then not get what they expected because they were also personally fiscally responsible in saving up and investing for retirement   gt Increase immigration immigrants are typically younger and can add to the long term solvency of the Trust Fund Currently we have about  or so new arrivals each year Significant increases in that say    or more   could be huge boons to our economy and our social welfare system  That just sounds like a ponzi scheme Which SS already is kind of but I wouldn t want to try and make it more so And what about countries who have negative net migration This may help the US short mid term especially but may not be fair to other countries   gt Expand what the Social Security Trust Fund is allowed to invest in right now SS is only allowed to invest in special issue Treasury bonds with interest rates about the same as  year T bills or about  per annum The Trust Fund could be made more like a conventional sovereign wealth fund and invest in conventional stocks and bonds to achieve higher returns The Norwegian Oil Fund for example has achieved an average annual return of   in the last  years Of course people would be worried about the higher risk this entails but this could be contained by limiting the amount the fund can invest in stocks  for example Norway s can only invest  in the stock market  regulating the levels of risk allowed in investment and conducting regular external audits of the fund  I totally agree I m not going to do the math but someone could and I m sure some portion of bond and market investment  entirely US Mostly US part international Part international may help hedge against poor US performance which would likely also mean poor wages taxable income  unless its do to with laws making companies profit less in order to pay employees more  even with no changes in the amount paid out would overall increase the value of the trust even in the rth case over the long term 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tennessee become a swing state Just because neighboring Virginia North Carolina and Kentucky currently have Democrats as governors doesn t alter the fact that Tennessee and the other  states bordering it don t or that Tennessee s state legislature has a R D split in its lower house R D I V split in its upper house its current Republican governor won election with   of the vote and the last time it voted for the Democratic nominee for President was  for Bill Clinton who took the state with a  plurality Add to that relatively low urbanization and the lowest  of African Americans of any Southern state and it s difficult to see how it becomes a swing state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well we re not going to be a monarchy and if countries with Presidents for Life can call themselves republics so could the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,Utah was a decided oddball in  McMullin won over  of the vote and McMullin and Clinton together won more votes than Trump Trump won only  of the vote  Given Trump s savaging of Romney he s not exactly courting the Mormon vote for reelection 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a great summation of why the mainstream press hasn t taken up the story There are   so many  variables here that I make it almost unverifiable Why didn t she disclose  this version of her story in any of the  years he was Vice President Why didn t she bring it up when she brought up her first account last summer alongside the eight other women Or even when he was running alongside Obama in   Aside from all the pro Russia Putin stuff there was a segment in her interview that didn t sit well with me She also said that she wasn t going to come forward unless Biden started winning  and that sounds all around fucky to me   But even more than that she said she d reached out to Warren s campaign Harris campaign and even AOC s office to tell her story None of them responded She said she reached out to news organizations and none of them responded She reached out to women s rights groups and none of them responded And I have to ask  Why Why did none of these women or rights groups take your claim seriously Its no secret that the press has dug up every black mark on Biden s resume for over a year It s their job to why would they suddenly decide to ignore  you    I guess you can see where I fall in this discussion but I think these are legitimate  and fair questions to consider Alongside your excellent and even handed summary 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In this scenario no ventilators get made because you ve stressed a vital bottleneck you didn t know existed because the system wasn t designed for this  As you say these are unprecedented times No one in the world has the information necessary to comfortably say  X Company I need you to switch from what you were doing to make more ventilators or PPE  Wouldn t in this case declaring the DFA be similar to a state of emergency in which funds are now released into the governing body s control   I mean no one is going to be buying cars for a long time and economists are predicting a worldwide economic depression Many jobs have already been permanently lost and there is the potential for some industries to completely collapse due to having absolutely zero income  I get that there is a very legitimate concern about stressing supply chains but at the same time if private companies have already can figure it out what are the odds the federal government doesn t have a team whose responsibility it is to do this Isn t that part of the whole point of the DFA In an act of actual war what s to stop them from this same argument Any precedence they have is at best  years old  can t use the current endless war as an argument since it s ongoing and is basically just us against a bunch of Middle Easterners that our government sold weapons to in the first place  
PoliticalDiscussion,You may need to wait to see how Florida ex felon reenfranchisement goes before decisively concluding Florida would become a reliable Republican state Also hard to see how Georgia would become a swing state while Florida went the opposite direction Well unless all retirees moving to Florida vote Republican to keep taxes as low as possible In which case only a fool would try to raise children in Florida 
PoliticalDiscussion,I edit every post I make since I dont like the forum system all that much   I prefer live chat since I constantly have new thoughts to add to myself Just wait like  minutes after I post and you will probably get the full idea   But you are ignoring that fact that corporations are cancer They control everything in our lives and its disgusting
PoliticalDiscussion,Decisions are made on the margin whether to say on extra year or two etc  Everytime you tax something you get less of it  This is no different
PoliticalDiscussion,Cool ninja edit to clarify that at the end there 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would consider that the product of consumer culture Notice I said consumer culture and not the consumer   But thanks for defining my political position  buddy You obviously know me more than I know me 
PoliticalDiscussion,In my opinion the solution is   Interpreting and using Social Security for what it was intended People who can t work and sustain employment throughout their lives have a social program  Social Security as a safety net for when they can no longer work  It is a mistake to try to find a way to make it sustainable when the program was never intended to be a retirement system for everyone in the United States I would liken this error to trying to solve an overburdened prison population by teaching prisoners how to read rather than finding avenues for kids not to end up in prison Overburdened prisons are a symptom of something else aiming solutions at a symptom solves nothing  Trying to lessen the burden on Social Security while everyone including the government  and businesses view it as a retirement system or pension isn t the answer Businesses push the responsibility onto the government and employee and are then afforded the ability to profit I am not saying profit is bad nor am I implying capitalism is evil but if you work the government should not be providing your  retirement  Your employer should be providing a pension  This is the thing about some capitalist arguments especially ones I hear from Large corporations who claim they want and stand for less regulation and government interference Those same corporations leave it to the government  through social security to sustain a person who has worked their whole lives  Same could be said for politicians who demand cuts to social security but allow corporate interest to continue to take tax breaks and incentives and leave it to the government to provide for them when they are old   I think the solution should be aimed at making a framework for companies to move back to private pension systems separate from the Social Security Framework   This release of obligation from businesses and corporations to provide pensions to their employees came with invention of the k and they never looked back These companies take the same tax breaks if not more but provide employees and our society less  by way of retirement plans   If this framework was put in place social security would become solvent as only those who could not work would be using it  So here you have an industry like Coal Mining Their pension system went belly up and Trump put them into the Federal retirement safety net program but yet the industry still makes profit then and now So we as tax payers are paying for these businesses to profit this whole time when they should have been funding their pension system  And tax payers now are relieving this industry of paying pensions because we are now funding them through the Retirement Safety net program  Something similar happened in California with PG E they were managed as a corporation and  on the list  profit  employees  maintenance of the electric grid All of a sudden there s no money to fix stuff and rather than answer why profits were   they claim insolvency  This is not a call for extreme regulation but if these companies push their responsibility to provide a pension on the government and tax payers they shouldn t get the tax breaks they get because those tax breaks end up as profit   Maybe we could look at a stipulation like anything above xxx annual profit requires a pension system be provided to employees and said extra profit is used to fund their pension system   It just a though and I don t have experience as to all the logistics but the insolvency of social security comes its misuse as a pension system 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s basically Brian Boitano 
PoliticalDiscussion,We just need to fund social security  There s plenty of money we can take it from the defense budget or tax corporations and millionaires more 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s disgusting that you put all the blame on the consumer and none on the largely stagnant wages shitty employee benefits that cause people to dump whatever savings they did have into artificially high priced healthcare 
PoliticalDiscussion,Andrew Yang s universal basic income plan would stack on top of SS I thought it was an easy and direct way to improve the living standards of retirees and it would also help secure that important voting demographic to push for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe our economy shouldn t be structured like that in the first place   It s disgusting that people dont have savings in our society This consumer culture we created over the past few decades is fully to blame  Growth shouldn t be the only thing that matters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes you live in a society and the benefits of our society has been tipping more and more towards the well off  We need to help right the scales  If we don t society will crumble  This latest pandemic has shown just how screwed the average American is to any bit of trouble  We need to drastically change our social safety nets 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed If someone gets a job while on welfare for example their benefits shouldn t be totally cut but reduced to a point where having a job is still better than only relying on welfare 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Where would we be today if that was the case  Depends on when they started investing in the risky assets Current market index levels look bad compared to all time highs but if you zoom out and compare to  years ago it s a lot less scary  actually looks pretty decent still   Over long periods of time these types of investments do really well even considering the crashes 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a zombie argument that just needs to be put to rest Social security is not going bankrupt   
PoliticalDiscussion,Lol I already pay  figures in federal and state taxes People want to casually tip my marginal rate above  with this change and tell me to go live in a cabin if I don t like it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes If the pyramid scheme doesn t work why is it acceptable to force  of the population to foot the entire bill rectifying the math Most people like this solution simply because it doesn t affect them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not some all that meet that criteria There was also a  billion slush fund created that does not need to be paid back Administered by one of the most corrupt people to ever hold power over the treasury Steve Mnuchin 
PoliticalDiscussion,End it and let the people invest that tax money any way they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,You say that like it s a bad thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,This may be an unpopular opinion but   this coronavirus while a terrible tragedy may do a lot to save social security The problem is there are more and more retirees drawing from SS relative to working paying in Corona will   make an impact on that trend 
PoliticalDiscussion,It won t effect him because he is a Democrat The MSM only cares about women when it s allegations against Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,I highly recommend OP reads arguing with zombies 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they have been paying into it correctly then we shouldnt need to tweak it The reality is it was oversold and underdelivered and I should be held responsible for that
PoliticalDiscussion,They shouldn t That s why they have been paying into social security their whole lives it is a forced saving account to guarantee they are not living in poverty and a burden on society  They have invested into their retirement savings with every paycheck 
PoliticalDiscussion,Could be I m inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt but not to insist that it simply must be true absent any corroboration as the other guy in my inbox right now is doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,We ll see 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sovereign wealth funds have their own issues too Any sort of nationalized business is a lost opportunity Governments really shouldn t earn money 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s true they can probably also add shifts to work overnight which may not have already been happening 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re resorting to ad hominem  You resorted to including information that has no bearing on the validity or lack thereof of the accusation as  proof   It takes some chutzpah to pull that and then try to accuse someone else of a logical fallacy so you ve got that one going for you   gt As stated in my post post there are Also uncollaborated accusations too Many women don t ever tell anyone about their rapes  If you think one uncorroborated accusation  multiple corroborated accusations spanning literal decades well this circles back to you being in a place beyond reasonable commentary  I don t necessarily  expect you to follow that because you re doing the thing where you say anything no matter how ridiculous to make your position seem plausible but   well that s what it is  Look I get it I really do Your personal opinions about the Democratic primary mean you re not willing to wait for corroboration or clarification You want Joe Biden to lose you think this will make him lose therefore you re all in on it  And that s   well not fine but it s how our politics tend to work But don t sit here and try to tell me that s  reasonable  
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t surprise me I saw a poll the other day that among Biden s supporters the people  enthusiastic to vote for him is the lowest for a Democrat in  years Trump has been holding steady Enthusiasm counts for a lot  I feel like a lot of Democrats have a strange relationship with candidates You ll see it here a lot like people saying they voted for Biden not because they were particularly enthusiastic about him themselves but because they perceive him as being best positioned to win over or get other people to settle for him and they want to beat Trump so that makes sense as to what to do But you end up with an electorate that all imagines themselves to be like Nate Silver or like some kind of political strategist in the voting booth And you wind up with a candidate that few people are really jazzed up about only that he appeals to this hypothetical other person who they don t know but have imagined in their heads 
PoliticalDiscussion,Weren t almost all of them anonymous It s hard to take unnamed accusers seriously
PoliticalDiscussion,Humanity must prevail  Keep fighting the good fight Sending love   positivity from the USA to all Kiwis   
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t even  want a private pension   They don t make financial sense as can be shown from decades of pensions going bust and they re far too risky in that companies have a huge incentive to fuck with them  A k may not be as generous as what a defined benefit plan claims to be but that s the rub  the last  years have proven that these golden defined benefit plans were shitty promises made by people who knew they would never have to uphold them and that it would be somebody else s problem  Going back to that is just going to repeat that history all over again  It is simply impossible to balance a perpetual system around how generous those old plans were 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you made a million a year then you paid full fare on social security all those years  You paid for others to get social security   But if you take away the return in the end then the rich become quite motivated to kill social security entirely as a tax rather than an entitlement  Social Security really works well because it s an entitlement as in we are all entitled to its benefits

PoliticalDiscussion,It s not a  to ratio it s partially welfare partially savings 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is my frustration with the DPA use why not use GE  They already make all the equipment and they are now going to lay off  of their workforce instead of re tooling and using their pre existing facilities 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats why the law exists 
PoliticalDiscussion,Has the intercept said anything as far as corroborating it Last I saw the intercept just reported about her rebuff movement nothing about the veracity of the assault confirmation of timelines   whereabouts contemporary interviews etc
PoliticalDiscussion,Oprah or michelle obama  Stoke turnout like its no ones business  Actual politician choice since biden could die in office Stacey abrams  He doesnt need a progressive if sanders gets progressive concessions for finally dropping out
PoliticalDiscussion,The intercept is pretty legit they broke the Kavanaugh story In fact it was the same journalist who reported in this story and broke the Kavanaugh story 
PoliticalDiscussion,The last  years I ve paid it and I d say there s a about a zero percent chance of me seeing anything when I hit SS age They won t take it away from anyone who is already receiving it so you re fine but people like me who are in the middle gap will get screwed 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of jobs require basic computer skills Seventy year olds aren t the most tech savvy lot 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but that s where life planning and community comes back into play When SS was initiated people had just suffered through the Great Depression They knew that if they wanted to survive through catastrophes they had to apply themselves to the fullest and plan save accordingly by living frugally They also knew that community is an integral part of getting through the most dire of circumstances To be part of and in turned cared for by the community you had to be a contributing participant where your benevolence towards others would be respected and returned at your time of need  Both of the above concepts have completely disappeared People are ok working a zero ambition or advancement job for the rest of their lives so long as they can finance their retirement years around their SS  income until they die then still pass it on to their survivors And community is now a rarity since much of the benefits they used to provide are now provided by the government The main difference being that in a community you had to earn your place as a member But with a government you can behave as you want still demand as much as you can get out of them and if you re ever denied you can sue the gov t and become rich It is the whole embodiment of a sense of entitlement  I m sorry I deviated from your point I see what you re saying that increasing the SS age would only keep less productive people trying to maintain employment with ever increasing hardship My point isn t that we should ignore the aging population my point is that SS had a defined purpose and that should still be its purpose People need to stop seeing SS as an entitlement at all If they want to or expect to live past their prime working ages then they have  years to be responsible and plan for that Maybe have roommates live in multi family dwellings and stop having children out of wedlock SS should remain as a safety net for those who surpass life expectancy And I would support measures to encourage people to invest in their own  retirement accounts to support them between their chosen retirement date to their SS life expectancy date   The benefit of retirement is not something you earn simply because you lived past a certain age It is something you earn because you planned your life accordingly to afford rewarding yourself in your later years 
PoliticalDiscussion,SS tax is only on the first    In a world where people make billions of dollars that s just ridiculous Income inequality is growing The more it grows the less available SS dollars 
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicaid is routinely on the GOP buffet of shit to cut So is Medicare but they don t megaphone that As for SNAP and such Eligibility requires a maze in some states to establish The only reason they probably aren t dead is the general inability to do anything in DC States would rip them apart  Look at ACA expansion and how it didnt get expanded in some states 
PoliticalDiscussion,To hear the rhetoric the rich will The  will Apparently despite holding all the power the  will fork over everything  
PoliticalDiscussion,Agree Wyoming imho is mostly like the Dakotas or western NE Solidly red little scenery and no big cities Sure Montana is the same in some ways but Missoula and Bozeman are quite scenic Cheyenne is not nor is Casper 
PoliticalDiscussion,Vote out Republicans because Trump s self inflicted pandemic and associated economic meltdown will surely be their rationale for eliminating SS if GOP senators are not already talking about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,lower life expectancy to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s my question The south has always been conservative The northeast liberal Thing is I grew up in Nebraska and the Republicans have won here since  Our capital is named after the first republican Did we just get more conservative or what   My answer would be both parties had liberal and conservative wings and in some ways weren t all that different until the s or the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,It still didn t save him in TX AZ and Idaho  granted Idaho is pretty white  but Biden also won Illinois so Idk how much good it did Bernie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lots of oklahomans are part native and to be registered Cherokee you only have to be like an th Cherokee Lots of folks in Oklahoma might be  native and republican Even Elizabeth Warren was a republican for years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Remove the payroll tax cap Social Security taxes are ridiculously regressive and we lose out on extracting revenue from the highest earners the people who could contribute the most to it  That alone would make it sustainable No need for means testing or raising the eligibility age which is already high by world standards The retirement age should absolutely not be raised any higher than the current  Not by one day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Al Franken would disagree with you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I honestly don t think this year will be as twisted as  I m optimistic we re not going to have a repeat and I think this virus may actually be saving us in part from it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh New York is like Illinois in that upstate will get redder but NYC won t Same with California That s where things will get testy
PoliticalDiscussion,As far as I know Trump is only protected against criminal charges because of the Office of the Presidency The moment he s out the warrants for his arrest might soon follow He has to throw every single thing he possibly can at the Democratic nominee for him the stakes are very high and it s not likely he will be pardoned by a Democratic president      It s going to get  extremely ugly Swift boating is going to feel like bygone halcyon days 
PoliticalDiscussion,It shouldn t be funded only by a payroll tax  It should be paid for as flexibly as we pay for the military using the full assets of the gov t  Funds should be allocated by a fixed algorithm using standard actuarial principles to minimize political attacks 
PoliticalDiscussion,The rest of Illinois is the bastard child of Illinois Indiana and Kentucky  at least south of Carbondale 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can accuse Bernie of sexually assaulting me right now Will you stop supporting him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well because they have nowhere else to go really Do democrats want Mormons 
PoliticalDiscussion,Iowa where I live now will be safe red but in terms of Congress I see us having more Dems then republicans The th district is heavily republican and rural with only two cities over   Ames and Sioux City and it will stay that way As a whole Iowa will go red statewide but Dems will always be competitive   In Nebraska where I grew up I see Omaha s district as a tossup and as the state gets more urban I expect the first to be more competitive but I also think Nebraska might lose its rd district in    As for new solid states in other areas I see Ohio going red PA will also be more competitive Also I think Virginia and Colorado will get bluer 
PoliticalDiscussion,  Fund it from consolidated revenue    Increase wages for low income people so SS has more money 
PoliticalDiscussion,There were multiple incidents She spoke out on a few when Biden called Lucy Flores a liar then shared the rape one later    gt  Reade said she didn t consider the acts toward her sexualization   Her point being was that there were actions by Joe Biden to Tara that were exactly like Lucy s This wasn t describing the rape incident I do feel that she should be asked why she didn t consider them sexualization for those incidents 
PoliticalDiscussion,i get ssi where the maximum payment is  try saving money on that while living independently and taking care of your physical and psychological health   you generally can t at least in terms of long term savings though if you re lucky enough to get a subsidized rent you might be able to enough to cover emergencies 
PoliticalDiscussion,No problem it s an easy mixup 
PoliticalDiscussion,You shouldn t bother talking her out of it next time  Some people learn better by doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,No meta discussion All comments containing meta discussion will be removed 
PoliticalDiscussion,That makes more sense thks for fact check
PoliticalDiscussion,Very simple  Increase the retirement age by one year adds forty years of solvency 
PoliticalDiscussion,She never revised her claim There were multiple incidents she just withheld the rape incident until now Even if you consider this  changing the story  then  twice would be a more accurate description of  multiple     gt is obviously politically against Biden  I wouldn t expect someone to go with their abuser Also Ford was  politically against her abuser    gt and theres ample reason to suspect a connection to Russia  So far there hasn t been any found 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then save aggressively for retirement SS isn t your retirement fund it s there to put food on the table when you re no longer able to work You re in charge of your finances not anyone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,Warren might think she d get a vp spot Typical political bs done by everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s sad I m not a dem but I respect the hell out of Gillibrand for that If someone does that stand up Sadly people won t It s winning above all 
PoliticalDiscussion,He said literally nothing about the rich There can be two problems at once which both deserve attention you know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly surprised he hasn t had a case of accidental polonium poisoning yet 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sadly a lot of finger pointing and name calling and people who will crucify their enemy even if their friend did the same thing or worse Sadly that s just human nature It s okay for me but not for you I m the one whose sorry but you aren t I m telling the truth but you re lying Typical bullshit from humanity 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s inaccurate I believe when you say  million immigrants you re referring to the total number of new permanent residents but I was referring to new arrivals Even prior to Trump we would get only about  thousand in new arrivals the remainder are status adjustments for example people upgrading work visas to green cards 
PoliticalDiscussion,Quit cutting gutting it to reimburse the treasury for failed Republican policies
PoliticalDiscussion,remove the cap
PoliticalDiscussion,k down from  mil immigrants   Yea people stopped coming and current president situation ain t helping
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a flatmate who was seriously talking about requesting a pay decrease because of that I told her like three seperated times that s not how tax works  And she seemed to understand   Still kept bringing it up every couple of weeks and I had to talk her down multiple times 
PoliticalDiscussion,You realize that s a crock of shit right  Working well into old age to enjoy a few years without busting your ass doesn t sound all that great to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Treasury bonds owned by the Social Security Trust Fund are paid back regularly and with interest typically around    In recent years returns have been almost  billion   The long term effect of this is that the Trust Fund outpaces inflation and a little more  which makes your point about the Fed moot  Could the Trust Fund be invested in riskier ways with higher returns Yes but Congress dictating that the Trust Fund invest in only the safest assets US Treasury Bonds is in no way the same thing as  raiding  it s not even close  Moreover fears about the Fed causing hyperinflation are massively overblown Your comment of  sound money hints at transitioning to the gold standard or something else which is just frankly ridiculous   and practically every economist agrees  
PoliticalDiscussion,Stop spending the money we put into it like it is a piggy bank  Done  Next question 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indeed   so I wonder why my original post is currently  in the love department     ho ho 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right it s very misunderstood While  raiding it isn t exactly what happened they  borrow from social security all the time which I consider a raid   Social Security invests into Federal Savings Bonds What are Federal Savings Bonds They are government debt They are a vehicle the government uses to spend money today that it intends to tax tomorrow  So they didn t literally go to the SS Fund and grab the money right from it but the long term effect of what they are doing is the same thing  Then there s my other point which is even bigger 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanders supporters are pushing this for one of two reasons or both   They think they can  take out Joe Biden the same way that Al Franken was taken out    They want Biden to lose the general to  teach the corporate democrats a lesson 
PoliticalDiscussion,The interest earned on monies collected needs to be reinvested back into social security coffers and not diverted to other government expenses The ongoing monies collected and the interest accrued by those monies is sufficient to sustain 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In order to make payout during things like this   etc we would have to back stop losses of all those risky assets   I m not sure that s true Again it depends on when the money was invested If we keep current payout tables I don t think there would be a huge issue if the money was invested there  years prior to benefits payout even during a crash 
PoliticalDiscussion,In order to make payout during things like this   etc we would have to back stop losses of all those risky assets Which begs the question of why we need to invest in anything when we can print unlimited money anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,The SSN is already used as a quasi Federal ID as it is already May as well make an official ID at this point At least it would add more protection against identity theft with having a picture on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Life expectancy for women is almost  it s  for men   One issue I think about when it comes to raising the SS entitlement age is keeping  year old people in the workforce despite not being productive workers anymore Some may havk s to retire with but many will not or they wont have enough saved in their k to do much with At least  of them will have to work if not more This floods the economy with workers who take jobs away from others or just become unemployed burdens on society 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the federal reserve claims inflation is   The  year bonds pay anywhere from  to     However while we argue how many angels can dance on the head of a pin the cost of groceries has been climbing at a steady rate of anywhere between  and  per year while the median cost of houses has been climbing at a brisk pace of  per year  See   Now if we take the big mac index inflation is BAD If the dollar had no inflation social security taxes would have been able to stay the same and provide the same benefit   except there is inflation     If we look at transportation   The price of new cars are up on average  year over year despite replacing worker with robots to cut labour costs     The question we should all be asking is whether the federal reserve is lying about the true rate of inflation Housing and food have both risen sharply Transportation has risen at double the listed price tag for inflation while man hours to build a new car have stayed the same or dropped  Also just because a herd of lemming believes that they will find riches and wealth by jumping headfirst off a cliff does not mean they will The duck that quacks not to jump off the cliff is the one who is right The lemmings leaping to their doom are the ones who are wrong And the lemmings calling the ducks warnings heterodox quackery are truly the best representatives of what a lemming is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politifact is usually on point but in this instance they outright say that  according to Biden s campaign     I think the reporting on this particular piece is quite lazy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m more worried about the young people getting social security than old people who have paid their into it their whole lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,Must taste like your own cock because that s what you re tasting 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt progressive credentials is unquestionable  Gay marriage   gt I think Tulsi is a better choice as Elizabeth Warren is prone to committing acts of political suicide  Present
PoliticalDiscussion,We have to stop everyone from getting on social security for bullshit reasons Maybe set a limit to how much one has to pay in before they can get some out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey I commented a bit ago but I want to share this with you A pretty long form piece written by Brian and Eddie Krassenstein on Medium regarding Tara Reade Just published a few hours ago     Evidence Casts Doubt on Tara Reade s Sexual Assault Allegations of Joe Biden  
PoliticalDiscussion,Prob not
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the country would be better off if those states didn t exist in the union  They bring down the average quality of life for the country
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see this pandemic as a solid argument to switch our health care insurance policies because even the systems that the harder left argue would help us aren t holding up in countries like Italy and UK The issue isn t the systems itself it s the system s ability to withstand an exponential increase in demand And it s not economically feasible to always have a supply available for pandemic level demands  As for how it will affect the discussions around healthcare I can see a voice for more state managed  basically decentralized from federal to state county level healthcare systems and CDC approval pathways to better let states act as quickly and necessary as they need to get critical supplies where they need to be 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you think America would be better off without those states Combined they make up about  of the GDP   Im also not thinking of adding Mexico as a state I m thinking like Europe style borders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yep I m laid off and don t have insurance now and that s costing a lot to get it if I do Seems like I ought to in case I catch the Rona
PoliticalDiscussion,You seem not to have read a word I wrote Yeah the US has enemies Enemies come and go just like governments  often those occurrences are related Of course we shouldn t have open borders with Russia   right now But in the future Why not If both countries are allies and care about the freedom and prosperity of their citizens what s the problem That s how alliances are maintained and strengthened You say Kansas and Minnesota are allies Surely they d be a lot less likely to  stay allies if there weren t free movement between them 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is what I ve said for years what should ve happened is having social programs tied into employment instead of the absence of employment If you give people an added incentive to use employment and benefits together you ll likely spend less on the majority as a whole  Of course we will still have the poor elderly and disabled but social programs would be funded and likely better equipped for the ever changing demands of the population  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It d take at least another election cycle to groom another Mitch McConnell Literally only have to capture one to get single payer passed  I don t understand what you mean 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What stops Kansas from sending a bunch of degenerates to Minnesota say  Kansas and Minnesota are allies   You re focusing on an emotional argument by assuming that I see people from other countries as  other but I m arguing a logical argument   The US has enemies And if one of those enemies decided to take a bunch of sick impoverished people from Africa and ship them to the US we would be morally obligated to spend money on them But if this is done at a large enough scale it could plunge the US into depression and make us vulnerable   Do you think this is a sacrifice worth taking 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe that Radiolab had a good episode about it as well I ll see if I can find it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hospitals drs not allowed to charge high prices also should be no such thing is  sorry this specialist isn t covered by your insurance and will cost you full soory you were unconscious 
PoliticalDiscussion,If only we had a public option for people to fall back to if they lost their jobs huh  Which one of the candidates would support something like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,No more deductables or least reasonable deductable
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Biden wants the current system but with a public option  That s a change 
PoliticalDiscussion,They get their insurance on the DC exchange There is no special Congressional healthcare plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are several possible avenues for change   cost  if enough people get sick the insurance companies won t be able to cover all the outlay and Congress will be asked to cover the difference Using that money to buy out hospitals makes more sense    perception  seeing people suffer Nope didn t work with sandy hook won t work here    group risk  Americas favorite rationalization is group membership Figure out what the risk is figure out who it applies to then realized   you re  not in that group It does hurt me so let s not change it As with  this requires enough get sick But if so this virus is a fact based orgasm that doesn t give a crap about beliefs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends how November goes which depends on how many people can draw a line between Democrats and making positive changes to expand healthcare coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Idk current health care system with reasonable prices and more generics might be a good start
PoliticalDiscussion,Well put it this way  Do you think adding  Alabamas  Arkansas and a  Missippi s to the Union  Would that improve America 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the whole game It s all a charade Why are abortion rights still a fucking selling point in politics Its this massive back and forth bullshit over issues that have no impact on the actual power structures in the economy politics Gay rights abortion racial politics  immigration tough on crime drug war etc  are all distractions where Rs and Ds can scream and shout and waste energy while the american public can continue getting drained economically and have their democracy eroded 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there will be some changes There are a lot of different medical insurance models A lot of people erroneously think that everyone has a single payer system and we re the only ones who don t but that s not entirely true The NHS is probably the largest model for socialized healthcare and there are some mixed results Something like a mix of Ireland and france s model is fairly doable I m not sure we can do a full one payer socialized med system federally It is possible to do a state by state system like Canada did I think that s more likely than federal because the next president can just overturn the whole health system I mean trump dismantled a lot of Obamacare though didn t cancel it fully 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really That hasn t even been an issue at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope  Look at how poorly some of the countries with socialized medicine are doing
PoliticalDiscussion,Where are they going to hear the alternative Trump wants the current system but wants more deregulation Biden wants the current system but with a public option The public at large is unlikely to hear another alternative to those two plans It s hard to create something you have never heard of This crisis would need radicalize a lot of people in the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,How do we get around it right now What stops Kansas from sending a bunch of degenerates to Minnesota say  It s a lot easier to view someone as the enemy when they re also the  other  Stop  othering people and you ll find you have a lot fewer enemies Way back at the dawn of civilization the  other was the people a couple miles down river Fast forward a few millennia and the  other is the people from the city on the opposite side of the sea Jump forward again and it s the people from country on the other side of the world Human history shows us that we have great capacity to increase the size of our  in group and in the age of the internet that s easier than ever I can talk to someone on the opposite side of the world and quickly discover that we have far more similarities than differences   Othering benefits the people in power The dictators in aspiration or in fact who know they can get away with just about anything if they can the populace fear the  other enough I have no beef with a working Russian who s just trying to feed their loved ones and they have no beef with me I  do have a beef with the Russian government  But governments come and go and if at some point Russia and the United States both decide to embrace liberal democracy then I see no reason whatever why I should fear the notion of people being free to move between the two nations 
PoliticalDiscussion,A politician will never be effected by America s bad health care system because they can always afford the premium care It s the poor people who will be effected not the politicians
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this will shift more of the public s opinion on it and considering it was already a hot topic I don t see why this couldn t be what pushes it over the edge That said with our current lobbying system companies have a voice in our government and they are obviously going to push for themselves so I don t think we are going to go full tilt the other way   That said I think whether the government steps in or not it s possible we see a shift With recent events people may not view insurance tied to thier job as favorably and would be more willing to take job offers without insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Future itself is much scarier than last month
PoliticalDiscussion,The Army Built to Fight  Medicare for All         They will still be there the dealers with the money The news channels will always tell their side of the story so the drug commercials won t be pulled The politicians will continue doing their bidding because the vast majority are for sale to the highest bidder      Mu guess it will be demanded by the public and an almost majority in one or both legislative bodies will string the voters along for many years Democrats will use the issue to raise money from progressives but there will always be just enough holdouts to prevent change 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that s definitely a possibility I think what it would come down to would be less crime in Mexico and more crime in the United States until it leveled out with hopefully a net positive impact 
PoliticalDiscussion,The US has had decades of structural inequality unemployment and rationed access to human needs Little changed during each crisis other than minor tweaking The big changes will likely occur overseas such as nationalising private hospitals and healthcare but would seem unlikely in the US It may take an extended period of austerity and market collapse for things to change in meaningful ways
PoliticalDiscussion,I can only hope so and try to share the info when asked   The majority of Americans hate getting involved with political economic change We operate like horses with blinders on Give us all the distractions to make us just comfortable and we won t care to realize life could be so much better 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  parts per plane         parts the vast majority of which were rivets or structural members      gt with intense electrical wiring     No There was minimal wiring and electrical use in the B precisely because it was a cheap mobilization design       gt Radios oxygen tanks pumps motors Unskilled labor is an insult     None of those things was made at Willow Run They were all manufactured elsewhere shipped in and bolted on The  only thing done at Willow Run was assembly of the airframe All of the extras gun turrets radio s  autopilots the bombsight radar engines the hydraulic system components the oxygen system components etc were amnufactured elsewhere to cut down on the amount of space needed and speed up production It takes very little skill to add pre made items such as a radio to the bulkhead that has the holes for the screws already drilled and tapped If you want an example of an aicraft where all of that was made in one place look at the B or B  which took  x longer than the B to produce    gt Do you think computers make it harder  You think they have to program the logic boards by hand      Do you think you can snap your fingers and have robots used to manufacture cars doing pinpoint soldering on cricuit boards or injection molding the casings   Having the schematics is probably the easiest part of the process Totally re tooling the factory is the most difficult because unlike your apparent belief it s not a simple as loading new programs into the robots or giving the humans a  minute in service      You re hearing what you deem  bad faith arguments because you have an excessively simplistic view of the process To use the B example the most complex part of that aircraft was the bomb sight which was only ever produced by one company due to the complexity involved 
PoliticalDiscussion,GDP would go up for a bit  There would be more money for a bit  for some lots of people would likely be displaced from their jobs   But crime would skyrocket and the areas they moved to would become just like the areas they moved from over time 
PoliticalDiscussion,No doubt 
PoliticalDiscussion,Somebody once pointed out the possibility of an open world Where all borders are interchangeable But a pretty good counter argument came up where somebody pointed out that Russia or other enemy countries could technically import a bunch of  degenerates or  people that would be a huge burden on the US system as a form of warfare   How would you get around this 
PoliticalDiscussion,And they re usually the bottoms   
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope Too much money from big pharma insurance etc   they ll make sure that it will never happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree
PoliticalDiscussion,The ideology they holds kills them the followers get scared and see the light Or so the logic goes   More likely they see the death of their politicians as an attack by the Dems further entrenching their beliefs and adding a dose of martyr to it   I d like to see a Republican spreading it through Congress just to make the mental gymnastics harder but I mean Rand did that already and we got no Republican back lash   Needless to say I doubt the hundreds of thousands of deaths from Covid changes any minds 
PoliticalDiscussion,Usually the better the economy  better the quality of life Because people have more money to do more with and have less incentive to commit crime 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unless it spreads out of control and kills millions of people no  Americans only do the right thing after exhausting every other option 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely However it would need to be coupled with a legalization of drugs at the federal level The main problem with an open border is the cartels An open border and the cartels would have a field day By legalizing all drugs you would essentially bankrupt the cartels overnight as their busisness model of shooting anyone who tries to interfere with their operations does not work well when you could just go to Walgreens and buy the same thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope we ll go right back to how it was  Even right now unemployment is still low    even after it s amazing jump up in volume that s still a low number for my lifetime  We may hit  before this is all over but unfortunately that loss is going to be concentrated in the same sectors of the economy that didn t have healthcare from employers to begin with  retail food service etc  
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely Free movement is an important individual freedom that we should strive for and in the long term tearing down artificial barriers between people is a key ingredient to a peaceful prosperous world  Now actually  getting to that point would be a tricky drawn out process akin to what Europe is doing You need to have some kind of common regulatory structure to avoid a race to the bottom in terms of labour rights environmental protection etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it might be more like  Stupid is as stupid does  Americans actually have the power to change this but we keep voting for the worst possible choices Not even against change but for changing to worse options  Perhaps and I say this with sad foreboding of what will likely happen over the next couple months perhaps a glimpse into the void might change enough minds to make a difference 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the Bernie crowd wants to conflate the terrible pandemic response by the administration with problems in our healthcare system  For this pandemic we did not do enough testing initially with contact tracing and quarantining like S Korea Now that the situation has ballooned out of control the issue is not so much coverage as anyone who goes to the ED will be treated and can t be turned away The problem is a lack of ventilators supplies hospital beds and skilled healthcare workers to treat the sick None of these problems now would be solved by universal healthcare This is a disaster response that is being mismanaged and left for local municipalities and states to manage on their own If there was clear leadership and disaster response from the top this situation would be different   The debate about changing our healthcare system has already been in the limelight for this entire primary so whether Biden wins or Bernie wins  very unlikely  there already is a strong push by Democrats and the far left to change the healthcare system 
PoliticalDiscussion,People should already think this The damage from COVID has barely started I fear 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea but the stupid portion of society wouldn t save anything So now we need some legally mandated ponzu scheme to save idiots from themselves
PoliticalDiscussion,Aren t neoliberal means tests the ones doing the trapping 
PoliticalDiscussion,the real break will come with differential healthcare    when mortality rates for the poor will skyrocket and remain low for the rich         oh wait that s already happening for decades  so maybe not 
PoliticalDiscussion,It d take at least another election cycle to groom another Mitch McConnell Literally only have to capture one to get single payer passed  I doubt it ll ever go away once it s been implemented 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion,The next President will be a caretaker They probably wont get much done except cleaning up this insane mess I do believe the country as a whole will move more to the left Too many ppl affected with Corona deaths as well as the survivors that cant be ignored nor should they be will help push public opinion to include a right to healthcare It will definitely help with climate change policies as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do not submit low investment content This subreddit is for genuine discussion Low effort content will be removed per moderator discretion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What regulations would need to be in place to reduce crime  Regardless of anyone s opinion on open borders this would be one area that would be absolutely illogical to worry about Nearly  of the US s law enforcement near the border works solely to stop people from crossing that border If they suddenly didn t need to do that Texas would gain  peacekeeping officers overnight That s enough to increase the size of every police department in the entire state by about   
PoliticalDiscussion,Not much Most people won t be seeing a medical bill on account of the virus A lot of people have lost their jobs but as a percent of the population it isn t  that many nor am I sure that a few weeks or months out of work fundamentally changes many people s views  One thing that might change is some people who thought  I m under  therefore I am invincible will see the price tag that some have paid for treatment and decide that maybe going through the small effort to get insured isn t the worst idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,I highly recommend this episode of revisionist history which talks about the time when the borders were basically open  illegal crossings were rarely prosecuted     
PoliticalDiscussion,How would that change anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s hope Health ins needed to be uncoupled from employment ages ago I can t believe we passed the ACA without doing that it was the KEY element in making something that worked 
PoliticalDiscussion,lol that won t change a thing Congresspeople already have their own health insurance separate from ordinary citizens
PoliticalDiscussion,The pandemic will change our health care system like our  wars in Iraq changed Iraq 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I think the only way this actually makes a change is if COVID kills several prominent Republicans  and probably some  centrist Democrats  
PoliticalDiscussion,yrdy
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because he got the hell out out of Dodge 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe  Millions of people have now lost their insurance  Thousands and thousands of people will need to be hospitalized and will not be able to pay for the bill A typical ICU s stay is  days   I am not sure how much  days of ICU s cost but it must be exorbitant  Once this is over the bankruptcies will start  Not just for medical bills but for everyone else who wasn t able to weather the economic storm    It s going to be a mess  I think that if this doesn t trigger some sort of political revolution nothing ever will
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden also looks like he could be showing signs of dementia so there s that
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope  Too many politicians in bed with the insurance companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course  The same way we rewrote all of our gun laws after the sandy hook elementary school shooting 
PoliticalDiscussion, simple words Keep Republicans Away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes Locking access to health insurance behind working a full time job for a large company is pretty weird in the best of times but with even a brief period of high unemployment it s ludicrous This is especially true since benefits take several months to take effect after beginning a job   Neither presidential front runner seems very enthusiastic about changing things but things will change Insurance premiums will go up even faster and more people will opt out of coverage or look to insurance alternatives 
PoliticalDiscussion, When people are presented with evidence contrary to their beliefs that reinforces their existing beliefs      Likewise individuals find their political identities in their twenties Those people with malleable worldviews already support Sanders  If Sanders wins he ll have plenty of momentum and ammo If Biden wins expect more of the same growing income inequality massive healthcare disparities  no he s not in favor of universal healthcare  and a continuation of our wars and climate inaction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cut out  and we re good
PoliticalDiscussion,It s difficult to say this early on The Bernie community obviously thinks so but their opinions are heavily oversampled if we go on internet chatter alone I imagine the general voting populace will have a greater diversity of thought on the matter I also imagine that no matter how poorly the next several months go there ll still be millions who will claim that this vindicates the current employee based insurance system and that they will genuinely believe their own hype   I imagine government spending might better take the spotlight Republicans have spent the last decade talking debt and deficits even as they past trillion dollar taxcuts that have sent the deficit soaring during relatively stable economic times After all the rhetoric about how we can t afford such and such progressive program Congress nonetheless worked efficiently to crap out  trillion in stimulus spending with more to come I imagine the idea that  we can t afford it might lose a lot of credence especially as the GOP itself has been gutted of so many of their deficit hawks and replaced with Trump loyalty tests I vaguely recall a backlash against Bush towards the end of his term as deficits climbed but we ve had several years of enduring deficits under the Republican president and not a peep from the tea party  Maybe so called  modern monetary policy is becoming a thing  Getting back to topic I do think Obamacare has already long since shifted the debate from health care as privilege to health care as a right The momentum exists with or without COVID  it just needs the forward thrust of younger generations of voters coming into their own and actually like showing up to vote If not today maybe in ten years At the very least assuming a Biden presidency come  the public option may now see a smoother transition into law especially as the GOP is further tainted their reputation on health care issues while Trump flubs the government response The public option itself could eventually be a backdoor to single payer in the long run 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hope so but I am not optimistic  The quote  Better the devil you know than the devil you don t  comes to mind as how many people view the issue  Change is scary even if it is good 
PoliticalDiscussion,Economically  Probably    Quality of life wise  Absolutely not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe it depends how severe the pandemic becomes in the country to the level where it s undeniable major change in the health care system is necessary
PoliticalDiscussion,Currently there is an issue of many farms being entirely dependent on technically illegal migrant labor in order to he able to sell food at prices that Americans are willing to pay Having freedom of movement would be major relief to both farmers and laborers in this situation  Also it would be a massive benefit to Mexican people trying to escape places where blatant corruption halts economic progress disincentivizing corruprion 
PoliticalDiscussion, parts per plane    with intense electrical wiring Radios oxygen tanks pumps motors Unskilled labor is an insult   Do you think computers make it harder  You think they have to program the logic boards by hand   Its the easiest time in human history to make machinery This process will likely be   automated   You get the schematics from GE or whomever you retool and get the heck to work  Why do you think this is somehow less achievable   We have the tech the money the manpower   all I hear are bad faith arguments that making more of a pre existing technology is impossible 
PoliticalDiscussion,No    The vast majority of people will not go to the hospital or even a doctor if they get this   Greater than  of Americans have health at so it won t be an issue even if they need to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,What specifically didn t you approve of The opening sentence I ll re submit with edits
