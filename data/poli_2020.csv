&gt;The CDC has [three levels](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html) to classify a potential case of COVID-19:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Person Under Investigation (PUI):** Any  person who is under investigation for having the virus that causes  COVID-19, or who was under investigation but tested negative for the  virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Presumptive Positive case of COVID-19:**  *Anyone who has tested positive for the virus, but testing was conducted  at the local or state level.* Currently, presumptive positive cases must  have sample undergo confirmatory testing at the CDC.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19:** Anyone who has tested positive for the virus at the CDC laboratory. 

It is factually impossible to claim someone is ""**presumptive positive**"" but also ""**has never been tested**"".

&gt; Local news said he and his dad were presumptive positive. They did not need a test. They said return if symptoms got worse.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;You will get told to self quarantine and return if situations get worse. The kid was only tested after he passed. 

It cannot be true that he was ""presumptive positive"" while alive if he wasn't tested or didn't obtain results until after he died.

The number or availability of tests has nothing to do with this.",,1585433132,{},fls2ru5,False,t3_fqmx0g,False,True,t1_fls10ve,/r/politics/comments/fqmx0g/teen_who_may_have_died_of_coronavirus_was_turned/fls2ru5/,1585433134,1,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,0,,,2020

Anyway, have you heard about Reade's financial difficulties in 2017 ($400,000 in bank debt, somehow) and her sudden change of stance regarding Russia (evidenced by her pre-2017 anti-Russia tweets) which was accompanied by her suddenly beginning to tell a new story about Biden...which she began doing via tweets to Trump's twitter?

And this was *before* Joe Biden's sexual assault controversy got the traction it deserves. Joe Biden doesn't care about my generation and I'm not playing this game *again.* I agree with quite literally *nothing* that Biden has done and will do because he doesn't represent *any* of my beliefs or values. He will fight for *none* of the issues I find important. The man has sever cognitive decline, is very likely a serial groper, and his policy runs counter to what I believe in. The reality is that this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, and Biden has done *nothing* to get progressives and young people on his side, among others.

So yeah, I get it. I would never vote for Trump under any circumstance whatsoever, short of Rand Paul holding a gun to my head. 70% of voters under 44 went to Sanders and Biden has done more to take a shit on those people than earn their trust. Every uninformed dumbass and establishment entity who propped up Biden in the primaries because this geriatric vegetable was more electable against Trump can reap what they sow. I have about as much faith in this pervert winning this election as I do in entrusting Republicans with taxpayer money. 

That said, I will more than likely have no choice but to vote for this milquetoast lech with crippling dementia, which is still better than the sociopathic lech with no principles whatsoever, not to mention allowing the Republican party to install more judges and rule the country for the next 50 years. Best case scenario, the virus removes the Republican party, Trump administration, senate Republicans, and Joe Biden, with Sanders jumping back into the fold. Realistically though, the economy will continue to collapse, Republicans will continue to ruin everything out of malevolence, voter turnout in 2020 will be abysmal, Democrats will continue push their heads further up their own asses while simultaneously contracting their sphincters because their candidates are dogshit, and the sum total of average Americans will continue to suffer as a result. Joe Biden is quite possibly the worst candidate on offer to face off against Trump and I think that will be strongly reflected in this election. The multi-trillion dollar stimulus package (social welfare package for the billionaire class) is going to be viciously abused moving forward, as was entirely expected, and we may very well be facing 20-30% unemployment under Trump in his second term, as the virus continues to take it's toll as a result of administrative incompetence and poor decision making, also known as Republican ethics.

&gt;As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him  and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I  do to inherit eternal life?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone. You  know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit  adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you  shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.’\[[a](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Mark.10:17%E2%80%9310:31#footnote-24608a)\]”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”  
&gt;  
&gt;At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”  
&gt;  
&gt;The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is\[[b](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Mark.10:17%E2%80%9310:31#footnote-24613b)\] to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will  fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes,  brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with  persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

 

&gt;And Jesus went into the temple of  God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and  overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that  sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called  the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

&gt; Section 15010(c)(3)(B) of Division B of the Act purports to require the Chairperson of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to consult with members of the Congress regarding the selection of the Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director for the newly formed Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. The Committee is an executive branch entity charged with conducting and coordinating oversight of the Federal Government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. I anticipate that the Chairperson will be able to consult with members of the Congress with respect to these hiring decisions and will welcome their input. But a requirement to consult with the Congress regarding executive decision-making, including with respect to the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive branch operations, violates the separation of powers by intruding upon the President’s power and duty to supervise the staffing of the executive branch under Article II, section 1 (vesting the President with the “executive Power”) and Article II, section 3 (instructing the President to “take Care” that the laws are faithfully executed). Accordingly, my Administration will treat this provision as hortatory but not mandatory.

In other words, the Treasury ICIG has the power to hire the members of the PRAC and will welcome Congress' input but doesn't require Congress' approval.

&gt; Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the Department of the Treasury to manage audits and investigations of loans and investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act. Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the SIGPR to request information from other government agencies and requires the SIGPR to report to the Congress “without delay” any refusal of such a request that “in the judgment of the Special Inspector General” is unreasonable. I do not understand, and my Administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3.

They didn’t do much when he did attack the US in ‘98 because he was very powerful and influential, though that didn’t stop them from agreeing to hand him over (just not to the US) after 9/11. Politically speaking, handing him over to the US would have been suicide for the Mullah.

I think if you're going to construct an argument against authoritarian nationalism, citing a war fought along nationalistic lines with authoritarian regimes on both sides is a *terrible* way to construct your argument.

And since you keep asking: no, I'm not a supporter of authoritarianism, because I think it's *intrinsically morally wrong on it's own terms*.

How about you. Are you saying that you'd be fine with authoritarianism if we hadn't happened to fight a war with Germany at a time when they happened to have an authoritarian government?

&gt;For one, you're making the assumption that the average person is in control of these wars. It is those in power that wage these wars. Do you think previously allied powers (such as the US) favored Vietnam? Because I have a few videos to show you if so. What about the Iraq war? Many Americans were wholeheartedly against that war too. It's not as-if Americans support every war we're in and parade around saying, ""see, because of what we did post-WWII, these wars are justified"". Quite the contrary in many respects.

And your thesis is that these wars would not have happened if people had remembered WWII? Did the whole country forget about Hitler when Bush was getting ready to bomb Baghdad?

&gt;And all of this is missing the damn point that I'm making about remembering the extremes that humans can go to in regards to prejudice towards other groups. That is why I hope we remember WWII and the holocaust, and any other genocides that have happened since, so that we don't continually kill people in these ways and so that countries like America and certain European countries don't continue tilting toward more and more prejudice toward so-called ""invaders"" in their countries, i.e., generally Mexicans in the US and generally Muslim refugees in Europe.

And what good does all this ""remembering"" do you? Has it changed anything? Or has it just led to endless quibbling over who is most like Hitler?

&gt;1. Joe Biden is a bad candidate.

It may suprise you but I agree. I sure as shit didn't vote for him. I support him only because he is the nominee and if the nominee were someone else I would support them too. 

&gt;He said he would veto Medicare for all. 

He's plan for healthcare is not great, but it is a thousand million times better than that of Donald Trump. 


&gt;All of this means he’s not the sort of person I want to be the most powerful person on earth. 

Me neither, but hes better than Trump. 


&gt;2. Immediately getting behind a candidate you hate is a bad way to get concessions from them or your party. 

Electing Donald Trump is a even worse and more catastrophic way of trying to enact change. Go volunteer with progressive orgs, do not doom the planet. 

&gt;If Biden wants my vote he needs to change his behavior. 

Biden is not going to personally suffer if he doesnt win. Youre not hurting Biden by not voting for him. You are hurting millions of innocent Americans who will suffer and die under four more years of Trump. 


&gt;And if that’s impossible, if Democrats give everyone healthcare or tax the ultra-wealthy to the benefit of all Americans , then I need to get out ahead and start supporting a party that will.

Not in isolation. You have to consider the rate of *testing* as well. Part of the increase in confirmed cases can be attributed to more people being tested. The US is innthe very beginning stages and there's been a  number of advances and availability of testing now. It's likely that some of the hardest hit countries actually had much higher rate of infections that aren't accounted for simply because they lacked the ability to test for them. That has to be taken into consideration along with the percentage needing hospitalization and the percentage who eventually succumb.

We had people on NextDoor organizing to meet up in the parking lot at the trailhead to hike together. They were not keeping 6' distance. They were taking selfies with each other and posting them to document their ""adventure"".

Our local alt paper published a list of lesser-known trailheads to try to get people to spread out, but they had to take it down because those spots were quickly overrun. 

I wish everyone could have been responsible about this whole thing. But they weren't, and now we're even more restricted in where we can hike. I feel fortunate that I live close to a trail, so I can walk out to it.

The reason the DNC and MSM are trying to actually say it is over for Bernie is that they are afraid of one thing: Joe Biden. And what I mean is that Joe Biden is his own worst enemy. When he goes off script, which he does often, he ends up rambling an incoherent mess and then dismissively apologizes for going over time and then shuts up. Just imagine that happening on the stage with Trump. Bernie has said that he wants another debate with Biden, but Biden is refusing. Sure, he may be able to duck out of debating with Bernie again, but you know for sure that he will not be able to hide from Trump. He will have to go on the offensive and he will have to be able to debate Trump. The best way to beat Trump is on the debate stage.

Healthcare in this country is astronomically expensive, and calls for single payer healthcare are always rejected with the same argument: our free market system is so great! Competition keeps prices down, patients just need to be smarter and shop around!    
   
So if you're an uninsured American who needs healthcare, even knowing where to go becomes a byzantine catch 22. Your average person doesn't know the ins and outs of COBRA, EMTALA, or other healthcare-related laws. They probably don't know what the real difference is between a walk-in/""minute"" clinic, an urgent care center, a free standing emergency room, and an actual full-functioning hospital with an emergency department.    
   
If you're uninsured, these are the kinds of ""free market"" decisions that patients seeking care have to make. Hmmm... If going to the hospital *might* save your life, but could very well leave you with six figures of medical bills, that becomes the last stop.   
   
People die as a result of that. They don't die because of NBC's headlines.

I do believe in that one although all eight economics professors I studied under would argue for free trade to the very end.

I get it, and I've had my share of conversations with my conservative friends that are more well off than me to try and communicate that sentiment. I do hesitate at the grey area in the term ""using my privilege,"" because I think that's where things get messy.  When you start thinking you don't deserve success because of your skin color, or that you should feel as if you somehow didn't earn it, or your path was easier, I get turned off.  I don't believe it needs to be that sort of dichotomy.  Maybe I'm just rare in my stances.  For example, I think Kaepernick will be on the right side of history, and I can't stand the narrative people use that he was disrespecting soldiers or the flag.  I think the Trayvon Martin case basically leads to people starting shit with others they don't like, and when they realize they can't actually back it up, they can shoot them in self-defense.  That's ridiculous and dangerous, because the dead guy can't testify otherwise.  But, I also don't like the idea of what feels like the American Dream being crushed.  That there is somehow a notion that it's the typical middle class person that pressing the lower class, and you should feel bad or like you didn't deserve going from $40,000 a year to $210,000 in your career.  

This went way sideways in trying to prove to you or whoever, I just don't see things as black and white and often play both sides of the fence.

The primary reason the US now has the largest number of recorded cases is due to our rapid increase in testing. The US is now testing more people in a week than South Korea did in two months.We're just now identifying more cases than any other country. The US now leads the world in testing, many countries are still very behind in this regard. Not to mention the US population is significantly larger than just about every other country outside of China. 

&gt;The spread is well out of control whereas in China it appears to be completely under control.

Very few people actually believe China's reported numbers. They have a long history of giving false domestic data from just about every thing you can think of. We know that about  21 million of their cell phone users dropped off recently, and that funeral homes were ordering thousands of urns a week. Don't be so naive to believe Chinese propaganda.

&gt;It was literally called a liberal hoax by Trump. 

False. This has been largely and intentionally misconstrued by the media. Trump referred to “politicizing” of the coronavirus by Democrats as “their new hoax.” He did not refer to the coronavirus itself as a hoax.

again false. The US was one of the first countries on Earth to start taking decisive action, so early that the media criticized him when he started curbing travel. within a week of China notifying the world health organization the US started taking action on this, even while the Democrats were worsting everyone's time and distracting everyone including Trump with impeachment.

This comes as a contrast to the history of accepting the man’s account by default and dismissing women as liars. So instead of doing that, “Believe Women” is meant to ask the question “Why not believe women?” and “Why are we automatically supposed to believe men?”

If you have another definition, feel free to share it.

However, in the context of what I’ve found, what I originally stated still holds. Tara is making an accusation, so as part of the Believe Women movement, instead of dismissing her, we take her claims seriously - which leads to a presumption of Biden being a rapist because why would she lie?

Which brings us to the problem of perspective. Believe Women is a hashtag with a meaning behind it to support women accusing men of sexual abuse - but the type of meaning completely depends on the individual.

Many have said that the procedure is very standard (pasted info from Heart.org on that below) and can actually put him in a better spot than before the procedure. His recent medical records that were released were very very good for someone his age (likely better BP than eithe of us). Before the virus hit he was keeping up with a schedule that was just crazy, often multiple rallies in different cities per day, showing no signs of wear. 

To me Biden is doing much more than just tripping over his own words due to age. That recent speech where at the end he just stared into nothing for a few seconds than was surprised by his wife and just really looked out of it is one example. He can still read a teleprompter fine and discuss topics he knows are coming and handle soft ball questions like on the view but then in the few times he is speaking on his own he is all over the place, confusing things, not making sense, lying like being arrested in South Africa (i actually wonder if he thought he did and his memory is that bad). 

To me I would much much rather have an old guy whose health past I am comfortable with who has a sharp mind than someone who has shown recent significant mental decline. Also a plus that Bernie hasn't been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, including the recent rape claims (please dont fall for the many smears the dems and msm are pushing, really no better than Republicans defending Trump against all his accusations). Recommend you have listen to this ... as it sums that situation really well, including how ...

Not to mention how Joe is 100% against m4a. He wants a plan that keeps funnelling millions to his donors in the pharma and healthcare industry, will continue to lead to deaths of thousands each year and countless bankruptcies for doing something silly like getting cancer. His cost talking points are disingenous to say the least - multiple studies show it would actually reduce overall cost, increase care, and be cheaper for the people (more taxes more than offset by no premiums, co pays, out of pocket costs, etc.). I have lived in both systems and the current system makes no sense, bleeds money to the powerful pharma/healthcare system and is really set up in a way thay tries to prevent care to as many they can get away with, and take as much money from everyone as possible. 

Then there is there is his record... just a few highlights:
- 91 attacks Anita Hill

- 94 wrote disasterous crime bill

- 95 wrote counterterrorist bill which became Patriot Act

- 95 sought to cut social security 

- 96 voted against gay marriage

- 99 repealed Glass-Steagall Act

- 01 voted for the Patriot Act

- 02 voted for Iraq war

- 05 against bankruptcy protections against student

To me the choice between Joe and Bernie isnt even close. If the msm hadn't for months pushed the ""Bernie cant beat trump, only Joe can"" message even when polls said very differently then i dont believe we would be where we are now. Older voters have come out more than in the past and bought that story. Young voters have come out, just not with the same increase as older voters. Young voters (and many middle aged ones) are less likely to just gobble up the msm message and have overwhelmingly supported Bernie. His policies will do things like actually address climate change with the urgency that is needes since this is their future... something most older voters dont care about as much given less of a future left for them.

FYI - from heart.org ""A stent procedure is not like open-heart surgery, he said. ""A lot of times people think they are similar, but they're actually very different. They're similar in terms that we're working on the heart arteries. But it's different in terms of recovery time. After open-heart surgery it's typically six weeks before you can drive or go back to work. That's not the case with a stent.""
Harrington said the long-term outlook for someone who has had a stent procedure is good.

[],,lcarlson6082,,,[],,,,text,t2_bziir,False,False,[],"&gt; A woman accusing a man of rape is not hearsay and this is not a court. Biden's not going to jail just because you believe a woman coming forward with her story about being raped.

The hearsay is coming from the people who claim she told them. Dr. Ford's therapy notes are different. They were written documents from 2012. I'm not saying Reade's friend or her brother are lying, I'm just saying that precautions need to be taken when accepting hearsay that was never actually documented at the time.

Furthermore, I understand this isn't a courtroom, but I think the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" should apply generally to public life, not just legally. No one should have their reputation tarnished from allegations based purely on someone's word. Remember The Rolling Stone's ""A Rape on Campus"" story? I think events like that show that it's worth being wary and not jumping the gun. 

And for the record, I was uncomfortable with how the Kavanaugh situation was handled by both parties. Dr. Ford was also uncomfortable I'm sure, since she didn't want to come forward in the way she did. She sent a letter to Feinstein and wanted it handled discreetly.

&gt; With Biden's HR staff. Biden's former chief executive assistant, the one running HR stuff, just denied that she had ever received complaints about any inappropriate touching. Any, despite the many women who have come forward. Despite the videos we have of him touching women and girls. Why are you so certain that Biden's staff would maintain such records?

It seems like you are working with some preconceptions there. These women who have come forward have all done so relatively recently. Do any of them suggest this behavior occurred during the tenure of Biden's assistant--Marianne Baker--and in his senate office? Are you suggesting that Mrs. Baker is lying?

I understand that it is difficult and painful to come forward against powerful people and accuse them of serious misconduct, and that there is usually more to lose than to gain for women to make such accusation, but that is not enough for me to label as a rapist any man who is accused. Accusations should be taken seriously (I think the mantra ""believe women"" is inadequate), and that means listening to all sides, it means not making assumptions either way. Women have been denied justice by inadequate investigations, and inadequate investigations have sent innocent men to prison or ruined their reputayions. I don't think both those issues are of the same magnitude, but they are both tragic outcomes that must be avoided.",,1585433860,{},fls3zap,False,t3_fqcyhq,False,True,t1_flrzh78,/r/politics/comments/fqcyhq/joe_bidens_sexual_assault_accuser_wants_to_be/fls3zap/,1585433861,1,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,0,,,2020
