Dont think of brackish water as a solid block like that, brackish will be up the river tidally. What I mean to say is that there will be mixing constantly, and depending on the tides, the pycnocline can be more vertical or more horizontal. A pycnocline is a rapid change in density with change in depth, a gradient that makes mixing tougher, but its not its own layer. The most dramatic example is oil and water not mixing and layering themselves.

Your latter is correct, mixing is always occurring through tides and winds. Brackish water is upstream. Ocean salinity is lets say 30ish psu (salinity units, how salty), and fresh is little to none.

 The hostility you're feeling is just other people wanting to help narrow down the topic so they can better help guide your research. Oceanography is a HUGE field. It's a bit like asking: 

""I need to do a topic on science!""

""Ok great! What field?""

""Just science..."" 

You mentioned earlier you don't like doing what's already been done to death, and I can assure you research is a lot more fun when you're interested in the topic. If sea turtles interest you, expand that interest, and learn from the experts!

So taking a small step back, the topic of sea turtles. Biological oceanography will tell you how oceanic processes are affected by sea turtles or how the ocean affects them. Think biology

Physical oceanography can tell you how the things like ocean currents affect the sea turtles. Think physics

Chemical oceanography would be a challenge for sea turtles, I have no idea how you'd link them, but think chemistry for that.

Paleobiology could be interesting as you could look at the lineage and fossils of sea turtles. 

There's just a ton and ton of nuance and you'll have a lot of success if you narrow down the field some more. 

Don't hesitate to ask questions here, if there's one thing you should know about oceanography it's that it's a collaborative science, and none of us would be anywhere if we didn't have help.",,,1614133438,{},gojdc4d,False,t3_lqqbju,False,True,t1_goifrrs,/r/oceanography/comments/lqqbju/paper_for_oceanography/gojdc4d/,1614295479,1,True,False,oceanography,t5_2rez7,,0,[]

Sorry if they're too far afield, but look them up and see if you can find something more local.

Try googling research vessels, like the RS Sir David Attenborough (UK), RV Investigator (Australia) or Polarstern (Germany). Somewhere I saw a virtual tour that let you walk around the ship.

I would like to model the surface circulation only. So far, i only use following input:

1. Surface elevation from hycom and copernicus marine.

2. U &amp; V velocity component from hycon and copernicus marine.

3. Wind + pressure from Era5.

4. Salinity from hycom. (there is No 1 hourly salinity for copernicus)

5. Temperature from hycom and copernicus marine.

*For hycom data, i use 3.1 analysis 3 hourly

After the simulation, i compare again surface elevation and U &amp; V velocity component with hycom/copernicus marine and i get large rmse.

&gt; &amp;quot;The rediscovery of the massive DDT dumping ground off Southern California is certainly a disaster in need of context - how has the DDT, leaked from thousands of sunken barrels, made its way to the parts of the food chain that Californians rely on?&amp;quot; said Brice Semmens, program director and an associate professor of marine biology at Scripps.

&gt; As many as half a million barrels of DDT waste could be on the seafloor, according to old records and shipping logs.

&gt; When Californians learned in October that the waters off Santa Catalina Island once served as a dumping ground for thousands of barrels of DDT waste, the ocean science community jumped into action.

&gt; A crew was swiftly assembled, shipping lanes cleared, the gears set in motion for a deep-sea expedition aboard the Sally Ride, one of the most technologically advanced research vessels in the country.

&gt; By Wednesday, the ship was ready to leave San Diego and head for the San Pedro Basin, where 31 scientists and crew members will spend the next two weeks surveying almost 50,000 acres of the seafloor — a much-needed first step in solving this toxic mystery that the ocean had buried for decades.

&gt; “We want to provide a common base map of what’s on the seabed at a high enough resolution,” said Eric Terrill of UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is leading an effort made possible by the many scientists and federal officials who helped fast-track this expedition. “There were a lot of heroics pulled by quite a few people ... to make this happen.”

&gt; Public calls for action have intensified since The Times reported that the nation’s largest manufacturer of DDT once dumped its waste into the deep ocean. As many as half a million barrels could still be underwater today, according to old records and a recent UC Santa Barbara study that provided the first real glimpse of this pollution bubbling 3,000 feet under the sea.

&gt; “These barrels are full of toxic chemicals that could be causing illness among ocean wildlife and even humans. Ignoring it or claiming it’s just too difficult to deal with is not an option,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has pushed numerous agencies to make this issue a priority. “The Biden administration has indicated it’s interested in taking action, and I intend to stay on them.”",,,1615427232,{},gqiqabf,True,t3_m2eqxo,False,True,t3_m2eqxo,/r/oceanography/comments/m2eqxo/two_hightech_deepsea_robots_that_will_comb_large/gqiqabf/,1615433057,1,True,False,oceanography,t5_2rez7,,0,[]
