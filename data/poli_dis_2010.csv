We still have a chance to fix it, but if we blow this upcoming opportunity, I'm afraid it will be too late!
 
This is just a History lesson. I am sending it to all regardless of party. It is history and nothing can change it. All Americans should pass this on to everyone in their database. Both parties need to cut expenses, both parties have some blame, but this is truly what happened and Americans need to wake up and take our country back in 2012!!
 
The day the Democrats took over was not January 22nd 2009, it was actually January 3rd 2007—the day the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress.

The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995.

For those who are listening to the liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is ""Bush's Fault"", think about this:

January 3rd, 2007, the day the Democrats took over the Senate and the Congress:
The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77
The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5%
The Unemployment rate was 4.6%
George Bush's Economic policies SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION!
 
Remember that day...
January 3rd, 2007 was the day that Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee.
The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy?

BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES!
THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney ) for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment...to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES!
(BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie -starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a ""Chicken Little Philosophy"" (and the sky did fall!)
And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? OBAMA!
And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie?
OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!!
 
So when someone tries to blame Bush...
REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!""
Bush may have been in the car but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel they were driving the economy into the ditch. 
Budgets do not come from the White House.. They come from Congress and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011.

In that first year, they had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending, when Bush somewhat belatedly got tough on spending increases. Bush should have vetoed every bill that came in front of his desk!!

For 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget.

And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of these massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: 
If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets.

If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself.
In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is ""I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I voted to expand that deficit four-fold since January 20th.""

There is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us sends it on!

If all these are to be accepted then it appears the US government is oddly hypocritical.  The US is waging a war on terror against terrorists yet support a state that wages terror in much the same way.

These epidemics—which left thousands of children and adults paralyzed—provided the impetus for a ""Great Race"" towards the development of a vaccine. Developed in the 1950s, polio vaccines are credited with reducing the global number of polio cases per year from many hundreds of thousands to around a thousand. Enhanced vaccination efforts led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Rotary International could result in global eradication of the disease.""

The question comes from the context of India and their caste system. There people are born into arbitrary subsets of the population that through time and generations have been taught to believe some are superior and some are inferior. The inferior ones are exploited by the superior ones. The question is: In what direction should legislation go on the matter of preventing this? How much should authorities intervene? (If at all) After all, one could argue that the ones believing they are inferior are doing so ""on their own free will"".

Now generalize this. How much should society intervene with one's personal decisions when these decisions are harming oneself for the benefit of others? On the one hand there's the above argument. On the other hand in some extreme situations (like the caste system, they are doing it on their own free will) it is clear that some people are being exploited.

I would argue that a similar situation in which society has already decided in favor of intervening protecting the ones being exploited is the work market. In a situation where there's a wealthy group and a very poor group, the very poor will be desperate for work. This allows the wealthy group to pay arbitrarily low. Our society has decided in favor of intervening: if you're poor, even if you make a willing decision to work for very low wages, you can't. You're forbidden. You're not allowed to make such a contract with another person. The argument is that this helps get people out of situations where they can't defend themselves and thus be exploited.

What other situations of this kind can we find? In the case of castes, the oppression mechanism is indoctrination. People born in a low caste are raised by parents themselves in a low caste and taught from day one that they are inferior. They willingly proclaim themselves they are inferior and want to dedicate their lives to living in shit for the superior caste. This is an oppression mechanism as strong if nor stronger than financial dependence.

I think in these two cases are very clear that one group is exploiting the other. In the first case, western societies decided to defend the group being exploited. In the second case, India government seems (I don't know too much about the subject) to allow the practice of caste indoctrination.

What about the oppression mechanism of lack of education? Imagine two people one of them has a certain high education and the other one has poor education. Imagine someone wants to get away with making a deal that benefits him and not the other person (because that other person would be better off making a better deal with someone else). That person could probably get away with making said deal with the uneducated person but not with the educated person. However, this situation is routinely allowed in our society. I'm not saying it shouldn't be, I'm just wondering to what point is one's fault of not educating himself. Maybe he's just lazy and then he deserves being exploited in this manner? Or maybe he didn't have access to higher education, forever damaging his learning flexibility as an adult and making it impossible to defend himself against this kind of exploitation.

What other similar situations do we see or could hypothetically see?

- Truth is that there is no enforcement of this obligation. My roommate does not vote out of principle and he has never had any problems. So it is more of an educational measure, to impart participation on young voters and make it a habit early in life. Basically, it has caused that the ""default uncaring person"" votes, while someone who has a principle against voting can either nullify his vote (not blank voting, which is not the same, but more like stuffing a pic in your envelope) or find a way around it.

- Also, it creates the general ""Ritual"" feeling that is a huge part of voting where I live. You are usually assigned to vote in a school near where you grow up, and your parents, grandparents and siblings are usually sent to the same school or a near one. Voting day is a day where you have a family get together, eating and watching the news and fighting about politics (in a good way).

- Additionally, we have a voting system that we are quite jealous of. As there is a ""social ritual"" involved in it, we are very wary about methods, we are not keen on any experimentation that could led to tampering, and not allowing someone to vote is absolutely taboo. People in jail vote, every single one. You may agree with this or not, but it illustrates a point (I saw that in some states in the US, people with a record were not allowed to vote, and some people were not allowed to vote by mistake, and I was thinking ""what? they just walked out without voting? what the hell is that?"").

All in all, I see the US system and I feel that the ""vote if you want to"" is mostly just an excuse for uncaring people to not participate. Politics just fly over their heads and at no point have they been educated that voting is their responsibility as a citizen, no matter how apolitical you are. You can vote blank, not put anything in the envelope, but you have to show up and make that choice, and you need to choose the nothing over the names on the table. This makes them at least have to think about it. We had a participation of close of the 80% of the entire population between 18 and 65 last presidential. I do think that, no matter how shitty your populace, that number at least implies that you are a legitimate representative, if you win a majority vote with that mass.

First, let me say that I'm not saying we can all kick back and crack open a beer because SOPA is doomed, but I am saying that if you're panicking over it that you can catch your breath for a minute.

This here is a nice little chart I found on Wikipedia showing the entire process of how a bill goes to being a law.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Visualization-of-How-a-Bill-Becomes-a-Law_Mike-WIRTH.jpg

Right now SOPA is still in the yellow part. It still needs to be marked up and amended before it can go onto the house to actually be voted on. Now, while they do have a good chunk of the house under the sway of the MPAA and the RIAA its still not the entire house. From what I've been hearing a great deal of congress has been getting angry calls over this (over one million via tumblr last I checked, good work guys) and there's a fair chance now that the bill may well get voted down inside the house. Its an election year, several congressional hopefuls are running on anti-SOPA tickets, and contraversy is a dirty word right now. These guys do want to push the bills they support through... but they also want to get re-elected and no matter what Lamar ""Ran Unopposed"" Smith says, they're paying attention to us.

This is mostly my own opinion here after following SOPA for the past few months. I've been losing a lot of sleep over it and figured I'd share my views here incase anyone else has been as upset over it as I have.

Even if Lamar manages to push it through the house we can still kill it in the senate before it even sees the White House and even then we can put pressure on Obama to veto it. He's lost quite a bit of love over the NDAA and I'm sure he'd want to win some approval back by striking down such an unpopular bit of legislation.

So yeah, mostly just rambling here but I feel better for posting this. Again, just my opinion, feel free to ignore it or whatnot. I just haven't slept worth a damn since I first found out about this mess and I wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT: Correction on that. It was one million emails, not calls.

Everyone seems to share their opinions on Bush and Obama constantly. What do you folks think of Bill Clinton's legacy now that we've had plenty of time to reflect on it?

For me it's interesting to compare the Clinton and Obama administrations because there are a number of parallels but also some huge differences:

* The Republicans truly hated Bill Clinton but had a begrudging respect for him as well. Perhaps because Bill Clinton proved himself to be one of the greatest *politicians* of the 20th century.

* I think the Republicans learned a valuable lesson from their persecution of Bill Clinton which they have not repeated with President Obama. All of the invented scandals around Clinton made him a sympathetic character. They have stuck to attacking Obama almost purely on policy/ideology. 

* When Bill Clinton compromised with Republicans he had no shame. He was proud of it. He famously said 'The era of big government is over' and adopted a number of policies that were far to the right of where he ran in 1992. He made his compromises work for him politically. He realized compromise was inevitable with divided government and decided not to fight it but instead to take advantage of it. 

* In contrast I think the Obama administration was really caught by surprise in 2010 and simply was not prepared for divided government. They spent the first half of 2011 fumbling. They weren't sure if they wanted to take credit for compromises or apologize for them. It seems in recent months they have figured it out. They repeated the Clinton tactic of co-opting your opponent's issues (payroll tax cut) and have used the debt ceiling crisis to focus on deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility. Another tactic that worked for Clinton after the 95 shutdown. 


As for *my* opinion of Clinton I think undoubtably he was one of the greatest politicians of the 20th century. Unfortunately in retrospect it's hard to say he was a great President. Too many of our current economic problems can be traced back to his administration for me to give him a free pass. I think he had a very poor understanding of economics and fell in love with the idea of continuos growth and a booming economy that would never stop booming. Too many of his economic policies were predicated on the idea 'everything's great and nothing can ever possibly go wrong' but of course they did go wrong. I also think we have to give him a fair amount of blame for the Bush administration. Clinton fatigue was a very real thing even if people still liked Bill Clinton quite a lot. It really screwed up Gore's campaign and probably cost him the election.

We should clean up social services for the same reason we should the pentagon, to make it stronger. We need both!


This post is to remind everyone the pentagon budget is being prayed on by predator contractors that mostly care about profit and not what is best for America.  

My father served during Tet offensive and came home to be spit on and shit on by the V.A. Our heroes should be treated as such instead of contractors who have benefited the most.

Fake patriots are willing to have the bumper stickers but not fight for our troops when they 
are being shit on.


Consider we spend **10x** more than ANY OTHER COUNTRY on defense yet our servicemen are losing their homes or can't afford one yet we expect them to serve **5** tours?!. 

Our service men should get raises while less money should go to contractors who don't deserve it for poor performance or putting them in harms way for no reason (Running empty trucks across Iraq for profit)

If the government has laws against copyright infringment, yet they're loosely enforced on the internet (which is most people's primary source for media), then intellectual property laws are pretty much useless...right? It's like having a fence with a hole in it. On that side of the coin, I can see the reasoning behind SOPA. 

On the flipside, I don't give a fuck about intellectual property laws. As a writer and musician, It's pretty evident to me that intellectual property laws do nothing to serve the owner of the intellect from wence the property came! So there's kind of a circular reasoning thing happening here: If the laws exist, they need to be enforced. But then...do the laws really need to exist in the first place?

As I see it (and mostly of Swedes as well I would guess), is that you cannot have full freedom if you choose to be a part of a society/community. You HAVE to ADJUST to the values of the people as whole in order to have a functioning society AND ***contribute*** to that society.

My contention is that the ""pursuit of happiness"" argument is pure bullshit. The only people who are truly happy in the US are those ones who were LUCKY enough to accumulate wealth. And I say lucky because you have to be lucky to get rich (what if Bill Gates never had the opportunity to use a computer in his early days, or Michael Jordan lived in a remote area without a basketball court etc.)

I won't condescend to explain here what the NDAA or the Patriot Act is (follow the links), but I'd really like people to take a moment for consideration about the implications of this growing body of overtly authoritarian, and even totalitarian, legislation.  While most cities and towns don't have tanks rolling through their streets every day, and while curfews are rare, I'd suggest that there are more subtle factors to martial law than these things.  Additionally, while a widespread crackdown and purge of assorted ""radicals"" hasn't occurred yet, I'd like to point out that the legislation in question allows, and paves the way, for precisely that.  This legislation is, effectively, a declaration of Martial law by the U.S. government.  While arguably few people have been subjected to the worst effects of this legislation, the declaration has been made and many people are, basically and technically, existing in violation of current U.S. law.  If you are living within the borders of the United States of America, you are living under martial law at this very moment. 

Finally, while I don't want to argue too much about definitions... the U.S. has more prisoners per capita (and in total numbers) than any other nation on Earth.  Wiretapping and other broad surveillance measures have been codified by the state.  American citizens can now be arrested by the military, detained, and imprisoned indefinitely without the right to a trial.  All of this amounts to the very definition of a totalitarian police state.

A headline like this would attract most people to read the story as it did me. Living in the area, I remembered how cold that night was and I was duly horrified. While reading I thought to myself that drugs were most likely involved in this. My mind then shifted to drug policy, legalization (or decriminalization), addiction, personal responsibility, negative externalities, and then naturally on to Libertarianism and its position on the use of drugs.

A crack or heroin addict doesn't decide to smoke or shoot up the same way normal people decide to go to the movies or not. You cannot fairly lay the responsibility for the self on an addict the same way you would lay it on a normal person. Externalities such as abuse and neglect of infants are legitimate justification (I think) for the prohibition of certain substances, even if efforts are currently failing.

Is initiatory force by a democratically elected government in the prohibition of certain drugs justified when the potential danger that addicts pose to their own children and society is considered? And also does the parent owe the child the obligation to care for it (the child) in Libertopia? why?

Yet Mr. Gingrich is not stupid. He and the other Republican primary contenders who have echoed his attack have calculated that the only way to beat President Barack Obama, who uses the words ""millionaires and billionaires"" as insults, is to join him. It's unanimous, then—capitalism is immoral.

At last, Mitt Romney finds himself with an issue that can define him, an issue about which the 2012 election can be a referendum. This is Mr. Romney's moment to distinguish himself by proudly making a moral case for free-market capitalism.

A merely pragmatic case for capitalism won't do. That's the phony expediency that Mr. Gingrich employs when he panders to pro-growth Republicans, saying ""the whole purpose of investment is . . . job creation."" Capitalism has indeed proven to be excellent at creating jobs. But politicians—from the bureaucrats who lent federal money to Solyndra, all the way to the outright socialists—claim they can do that, too. 

The enduring case for capitalism—the moral case that Romney must make now—is that it is the only economic system consistent with liberty. 

Private equity—the realm of capitalism in which Bain Capital operates—is an expression of that liberty. There's nothing mysterious here. Private-equity firms are much like mutual funds that invest in stocks. But when a private-equity firm invests, it typically buys the entire company. Then the private-equity firm becomes actively involved in the management of the companies it owns. 

Sometimes that means trying to turn around firms that have fallen on hard times. And if that doesn't work, private-equity firms can't just sell their shares and walk away. They have to take the responsibility for tough decisions: closing down factories and stores, eliminating jobs. 

A 28-minute film produced by a Gingrich-linked political action committee focuses on four such cases involving companies owned by Bain, replete with tearjerker interviews with laid-off employees intercut with distorted images of Mr. Romney looking vaguely satanic. The movie's implication is that any money Bain salvaged from these companies should have gone to these benighted workers. 

The film is propaganda trash worthy of Michael Moore, not an aspiring presidential candidate who styles himself Reaganesque. For Mr. Gingrich to use this kind of irrationalism is a bid to replace the rule of law with the rule of emotions.

Under the rule of law, capitalists—investors in real estate, factories, equipment, stocks, bonds or whole companies—have the confidence to invest because they know exactly what their property rights will be under various scenarios of success or failure. 

So investors can knowingly take big risks, first when they start or acquire a company, and then when they have to pay workers before there are any customers or any profits. They understand that if everything goes well, their investment will yield profits, and that someday they may be able to sell the business itself for a profit. 

And they understand that if things go badly, and they have to shut down the business, all they'll end up with is whatever they can fire-sale its assets for. That could very well mean a loss. The workers whom they've employed all along will lose their jobs, but they were paid their salaries and benefits all along—investors who rely on equity profits have no such guarantee.

This is what the word ""equity"" means, legally. It is the residual share of value left over once everyone else—suppliers, lenders, the tax-man and employees—are paid. An equity owner such as Bain is last in line to earn profits or salvage the remains if there is a failure. In compensation for that lowly status, equity owners get the lion's share of the upside if there is a big success. 

The rules under today's politics are quite different. Consider the federal government's 2009 bailout of General Motors. GM's secured bondholders were contractually entitled to equity in the failing company, yet the president stripped them of their rights, giving their equity unfairly to the company's unions—which had helped get that president elected. 

This is the new order that Newt Gingrich is advocating when he attacks Mitt Romney and Bain: Equity should go to workers, not to the owners who made the risky up-front investments that created it in the first place. It's a vast new entitlement for labor—one not embodied in law but imposed at the whim of the nation's chief law enforcement officer and now advocated by a man seeking that job. 

Mr. Romney must stand up for the rule of law that underpins free-market capitalism. It can't guarantee a chicken in every pot—and neither can any other system. But capitalism does guarantee a fair deal. Investors in businesses, and the employees who choose to work for those businesses, know exactly where they stand, and they have the liberty to invest or not invest, and to work or not work, accordingly.

Today the stagnant American economy is starving for investment while trillions of dollars sit on the sidelines. If Mitt Romney can restore the rule of law that free-market capitalism requires, those trillions will have the confidence to come back into play. Very likely, that would result in massive job creation. Surely it would result in liberty.

This brings to mind another redditor's post the other day that linked to an [Economist article from 2004](http://www.economist.com/node/2592996) about the ridiculousness of copyright law terms and had the title [Once SOPA and PIPA get rejected, let's change copyright law and end the perpetual ""20 year copyright extensions"" that are killing creativity and stopping works from [ever] entering the public domain](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/of90g/once_sopa_and_pipa_get_rejected_lets_change/).

That post has the right idea, and I want to add to it the trouble with the current patent regime in the US, from software to medical tests, to plants.  The threat of perpetual copyright is significant, but generally most detrimental to creative culture and arts-related industries, where large entertainment companies can control culture by owning so much of the marketplace and using their large legal teams to hinder others, whether by preventing their publications or by getting a court-mandated cut.

With patents, the consequences are broader because they impact the ability of new products to enter markets, as well as their prices.  Here's on such example of the problem from a [recent Ars Technica article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/oblivious-supreme-court-poised-to-legalize-medical-patents.ars):

&gt;The case focuses on a patent that covers the concept of adjusting the dosage of a class of drugs, called thiopurines, based on the concentration of a particular chemical (called a metabolite) in the patient's blood. The patent does not cover the drugs themselves—those patents expired years ago—nor does it cover any specific machine or procedure for measuring the metabolite level. Rather, it covers the idea that particular levels of the chemical ""indicate a need"" to raise or lower the drug dosage.

&gt;The patent holder, Prometheus Labs, offers a thiopurine testing product. It sued the Mayo Clinic when the latter announced it would offer its own, competing thiopurine test. But Prometheus claims much more than its specific testing process. It claims a physician administering thiopurine to a patient can infringe its patent merely by being aware of the scientific correlation disclosed in the patent—even if the doctor doesn't act on the patent's recommendations.

When I read about this sort of thing, it makes my head hurt, yet what hurts it more is the institutional support this sort of thinking gets.  Later, in this same article, we read:

&gt;Justices Scalia and Breyer showed some skepticism that patents could cover the use of scientific correlations in medical practice. But the other justices expressed no such skepticism. At one point, Justice Kagan offered some advice to Prometheus's lawyer. ""What you haven't done is say at a certain number you should use a certain treatment, at another number you should use another treatment,"" she said. ""I guess the first question is why didn't you file a patent like that? Because that clearly would have been patentable. Everybody agrees with that.""

And so what we have here, just to recap, is an out-of-touch legislature composed of millionaires and judges (who decide on the constitutionality of legislation) who seem to think that everything that can be ""intellectual property"" should be.  We've made enough noise to stop SOPA and PIPA in their current form, but the enemies of freedom will not rest.  Instead of taking our victory and going home, we need to continue forward.  We need to eliminate software patents (or at least dramatically reform the approval process and see how that goes), we need to end patents on plants and scientific processes (or at least dramatically shorten their terms and/or reform the approval process), and we need to start ratcheting down copyright terms, as well.

A [BBC documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p1TOA99S88) a couple of decades old covers much of the ""did the US know about Pearl Harbor"" angle. But since that time, much new evidence has been uncovered.

Much of this evidence focuses on the US gov't/FDR having a *deliberate* *policy* to provoke Japan into attacking the US. After the fall of France in the spring of 1940, FDR feared England would be defeated and Nazi Germany would rule Europe unchecked. So FDR sought to unite the US and to enter the war through the ""back door"", using the Japanese-German alliance; thus creating a policy of provoking Japan to attack us.

In Herbert Hoover's recently-released journals, we know that Hoover claimed FDR was deliberately provoking Japan to do this.

But the groundbreaking work was done by WWII Navy veteran, journalist and author Robert Stinnett, released in his book ""[Day of Deceit](http://www.amazon.com/Day-Deceit-Truth-About-Harbor/dp/0743201299)"". (An [overview/interview with Stinnett](http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=408).)

Stinnett used Freedom of Information Act requests to uncover US logs monitoring Japanese communications, and a shocking memo written by a naval intelligence officer who routed communications between the White House and Navy which outlined an [8-step plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollum_memo) to provoke Japan into attacking the US. In the book, Stinnett documents how the 8 steps were enacted, all leading to provoking Japan into attacking.

The work of Stinnett and others is so pervasive it cannot be seriously questioned.

* Given the way that today we constantly fear attack, and much of that fear is based on Pearl Harbor, is it time we admit and acknowledge the real history of the event?

And, of course, considering that we know the US went out of its way to provoke Japan, with this -- along with other instances, such as the Gulf of Tonkin ""attack"" the US used to ramp up the Vietnam War, the fact that the US gov't knew Iraq had no WMD, etc. -- one has to logically raise the question:

  *  More terror attacks at home = new laws and less liberty





  *  US can't have land warfare against Iran. Iran has population of 70 million and the country is mountainous as hell. More than twice the size of Iraq!

  *  Whole country would unite to fight the common enemy.

  *  After initial attacks Iranians can escalate the war, but US has no means to end it.

  *  Iran is technologically and culturally more advanced that Iraq. Aerial warfare was ineffective against Serbian military in Kosovo war and same would happen in Iran.



  *  Iran can constantly harass oil and gas shipments in the Gulf with asymmetrical warfare.

  *  Iran can sabotage oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain etc.

  *  Iran could create a major oil spill and set it on fire: it would block the Straight for weeks, even months. Also, mining the straight would be a good option. 


  *  US attack against Iran will turn Iraqi government against US. (Iran has Shiite majority and they are already starting to purge Sunnis from the government).

Now some people would say we just need to force Senators to actually hold the floor during the entirety of the filibuster. But Senate time is so important that if a Senator even threatens to filibuster, the rest of the Senate will move on to other bills rather than waste time dealing with a filibuster. Which has lead us to a ton of vacant low-medium positions during the Obama administration that the Senate has failed to confirm.

For that reason I have composed a letter to AE requesting more of the open approach they are encouraging in the voting process. I'm going to email it to info@americanselect.org tomorrow night (to give room for any edits that may be needed) but if anyone knows some email addresses for their higher-ups, please let me know and I'll edit that into this post!


&gt;To whom it may concern:

&gt;I appreciate the effort Americans Elect is putting forth to open up the political nominating process. Millions of Americans agree that the system currently in effect is flawed, and reform is needed to ensure that the right people are running for office and, subsequently, running the country. By acquiring a spot on the ballot across the country and leaving the choice of candidates up to the Internet, Americans Elect allows each voice to have an impact - not just the Republican or Democratic delegates at conventions. Americans Elect is allowing America at large to nominate candidates, and with enough people on board, this could achieve a majority of Americans putting forth a candidate for President of the United States of America.

&gt;While your goals and efforts are admirable, however, there are many concerns regarding the organization. Primary among these is the source of Americans Elect's funding - namely, the anonymous donors who have invested and contributed an overwhelming portion of the donations thus far. According to user responses on the Americans Elect website, campaign finance reform is a major concern for many people, and donations from anonymous individuals or corporations are viewed with great skepticism. I ask that, in the spirit of openness, you contact the donors who currently remain nameless and ask them to step forward, publicly declaring their support for this group. This will go a long way toward earning the trust of the public, ensuring that this organization is funded by honest Americans focused on repairing the damage to our political system, as opposed to corporate interests or - even worse - political interests seeking to further damage the integrity of our elections.

&gt;I understand that Americans Elect is not technically a political party, and due to its 501(c)(4) status does not legally have to reveal its donors so long as its primary purpose is not campaigning. Americans Elect can participate in campaigns and elections. As the primary purpose is to, essentially, purchase a spot on the ballot and leave the candidate up to the Internet and then leave the fundraising up to the candidate, this is allowed. You have made it abundantly clear that technically you don't have to name everyone who donates. I am saying that you should, that it is the ethical thing to do.

&gt;Releasing the names of donors is a necessity for an organization seeking openness and equality in the political process. People cannot be convinced to trust you if they do not know who it is they are being asked to trust.

&gt;Thank you for your time.


24 hours from now, I'll be emailing this. If anyone has any suggestions they'd like to make to improve this, please make your voice heard! If you can find the email addresses for people working with Americans Elect, please let us know!
I am asking this because I truly believe in this organization, and I want to know that I am supporting the right thing - and if I am, I want as many people as possible to know about this so that they can join in.
Because that's how a democracy works - everyone takes part.

Civil unions for everyone.  Any two people who want to share their lives can get a civil union and be given the legal benefits that are currently reserved for those with a marriage.  Of course, marriage and weddings would still exist, they just wouldn't carry legal weight.

This satisfies two important criteria.  1) Equal rights under the law.  2) Freedom of religion.  Homosexuals could get the rights they deserve, and the Catholic Church (or any other religious institution) wouldn't be forced to give its blessing to something it doesn't want to.

I can't think of any downside to this proposal, and I think an intellectually honest, non-bigoted conservative would support it, as it actually removes one of the mechanisms by which the government shapes society (endorsing the Judeo-Christian model of marriage).

Every year the term 'home theater' becomes more and more literal. Right now in my kitchen is a plasma screen TV big enough to cover a good chunk of my bedroom wall. Recently my mother also told me about a friend who purchased a new TV and discovered that it came with netflix pre-installed on it.

Well, how does this sound? Encourage electronics and appliance developers to include that as standard in television sets and at the same time encourage the movie industry to create a form of digital distribution that allows pay-per-view downloads of new release movies at the same time they're in theaters?

Call it 'Golden Ticket' (just off the top of my head) and make it so people can, for a small fee, stream new movies directly to their television sets starting the same moment they're released into theaters? Yes a few theaters would have to shut down for it, but at the same time the industry would save on transportation costs from having to send the reels to theaters, printing costs (less movie posters, cardboard standees for theaters, and so on), and likewise while at the same time offering movie fans a legal and simple alternative to pirating content. After the movies are taken out of theaters they'd also be moved off here and onto other services (netflix for example) to make room for the next big releases.

At the same time I think being scared is also the worst way to make decisions. 

Are we all acting in haste about this?


 

IN the end it is a gamble.. let them get the bomb on their own and show some respect maybe we can work out a deal and the region has some balance (now that Saddam is gone).  We did this with Russia and many thought they were just as 'bad'

Or We strike first and give them ALL the reason to hate and attack us with everything they got.. 

Why no one on FOx news talks about Iran simply buying a ready made nuke from the great powers aligned on their side after they are attacked is beyond me. Ask yourself why wouldn't Russia or NK sell them a bomb?


Here are some points we all should consider:

  *  Israel has had the bomb since the late 60's. the Sampson option is one Israel has had in place for decades. Any nuclear attack on them will instantly mean the destruction of all neighbors including Iran. 

  * If Iran bombs Israel that is their certain death. America will nuke them. No one wins, they know this. Collectively the country is not suicidal, some even argue the Imams who have all the power (Ahmadinejad very little) care more about their livelihoods and bank accounts than destroying Israel. They use fighting with Israel to control their people. They are too busy fighting Sunni expansion.. 



  *  If we bomb them first, this gives them **reason** and justification to retaliate. They don't need a nuclear program. They can simply buy a bomb from Russia/China/NK/Pak and use it to retaliate, they will have their sympathy. No need to make one OR WAIT!

  *  Hezbollah will not sit on their hands. They will attack us here at home in malls and Obomney will use this to take away the rest of our liberties and get these bills past that they are having opposition to. 



  *  Don't let false quotes drive your fear. ""Wipe Israel from the map"". FALSE. ""Remove the regime [in Isreal] from the pages of time"" - Ahmadinejad rhetoric alone... Too many use this false translation as reason for war!

  *  Sunni Muslims are more a threat to Shiite Iran than Israel. Iran is alone with Syria in a sea of Sunni





  *  Iran has the youngest population in all the Muslim world. They respect their women who are doctors and other professionals. They are the most like America in the people are against oppression (even religious) by their government and want more freedom. They have been dying in the streets for 3 years protesting, much like Syria. 

  *  War with Iran will stop the Arab spring and force dissidents who are fighting for freedom back into the arms of their corrupt governments. Assad and others will win. We will create more of a problem then stopping.



  *  Iran has legitimate reason for nuclear electric power and quite the reason to acquire a nuclear weapons program for self preservation, given Sunni, Israeli and US enemies.. Once they have the bomb everything is different. We will actually negotiate. Today not so much.



Last fact. many many people get filthy rich with war, the same lot that lied us into war with Iraq WMD has made the most in the last 10 years, is also looking for new contracts and money train... they really don't' care about America as much as they want her here to pay $$. They are buying some of what you see and hear on TV to their favor.


God Bless us.

Perhaps I'm being naive about it, but this is just my take on what may happen following the hearings on the 18th.

Personally, I think there's a good chance that both bills will be defeated in the house and the senate. With a couple exceptions I doubt that most of the politicians, as much as we'd love to believe it, are acting out of malice, greed, or what have you.

Many of these senators in the past have supported net neutrality and a free and open internet, personally... I think when they signed up for these bills they weren't told the full story about what they are and what they could potentially do.

So why haven't they changed sides after all the outcry on the internet? Well, internet writer Danwin posted a very interesting article showing his viewpoint on just that.

Remember a while back when Google designed a tool for blocking child pornography websites from showing up in their search engine? The way it worked was that it recognized certain skin tones and other details in pictures that involved such and was able to find a way to edit them out of search results, preventing Google's invention from being used by pedophiles for such purposes.

Thing is, most members of congress are... well... older. Many are old enough to be grandparents. Now think on how often we have to help older relatives with their computers and other electronics. I know my mother's laptop would still be spamming a false anti-virus program at her if I didn't get rid of it for her.

Much of congress sees Google as something akin to wizards who with a few lines of code and a few clicks of a mouse can do anything with the internet. They saw them take down the child porn traders and figured they could easily do the same with the piracy rings... but the fact that they haven't must mean ulterior motives on Google's part (read: They profit from it). Enter SOPA and PIPA.

When looked at like this, congress isn't really malevolent towards the internet and it's users, just misinformed and lacking the knowledge needed to suggest legislation that could be effective for combating piracy.

The hearings on January 18th may be just what we need to get the point across to them as to what Google is capable of and how they could potentially help in the fight against computer piracy (In my own opinion, writing ""Fix your business model dammit"" on a baseball bat and smacking the heads of the MPAA and RIAA around the head with it until it sinks in) and will show congress just how harmful the proposed legislation really could be, especially since it'd be so easy to abuse.

Its easy to call them corrupt, but if I had a nickel for every politician who HASN'T been accused of corruption of some form I'd probably wind up owing someone money somehow. I'm willing to bet a lot of them are just misinformed and need to be educated in the current internet technology and it's limits.

These guys are politicians, not engineers or programmers. I'm a gamer but even I didn't know anything about the DNS system or using an IP in place of a URL until this mess with SOPA and PIPA started. They think these bills will work because nobody has actually sat down and explained to them why and how it's simply not possible.

Mind you I can't speak for Smith and LeHay themselves, but on Smith's part I wouldn't be surprised if he knew more than he let on and is really worried now that the hearing is imminent. His actions recently strike me as the behavior of a man who is getting desperate and it may well be that he didn't go into as much detail as he should when convincing senators to sponsor SOPA. I doubt he'll have many friends in the hill come Thursday, and a lot of members of the house may well feel they've been made to look like fools.

Otherwise, these bills are becoming politically toxic in an election year, have a lot of corporate opposition, and are losing support rapidly from all sides. Personally, I do not see them going anywhere but down.

Again, as the title says, this is an optimist's viewpoint. It may be I'm dead wrong here. This is just opinion, don't take it too seriously.

It has recently been concluded among the Israeli Supreme Court that Palestinians are more than just second-class citizens, but that they are a genuine threat to the security of that state merely because of their ethnicity. In the past any attempt to draw parallels between the Israeli occupation and the Nazi racial state have been met with disdain, after all, a thread dies once the topic switches to Nazi’s. However, after this act I feel it is absolutely necessary to draw a small parallel between this law and one passed in 1935. To say that the two laws are equitable is a bit rash, but certainly they remain in the same spirit, and partake of the same basic ideological framework; the need for a pure ethnic racial state. I do not here make the claim that Israelis are Nazis, merely that the trend of Israeli action is designed to ensure a racial and religious state that is unhindered by the threat that they denote the Arabs.
	
Section One of The Laws for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour include this stipulation, that:

Marriages between Jews and citizens (German: Staatsangehörige) of German or kindred blood are forbidden. Marriages concluded in defiance of this law are void, even if, for the purpose of evading this law, they were concluded abroad.

The idea that such a piece of legislation could exist in this world today proves but one thing: Fascism is not dead, nor indeed are many of the ideas that brought this world to the brink of such tyranny, and if they continue to exist and enforce unfettered, very soon there will be no way to stop it.

Most people have probably noticed that these two have been attacking everyone *except* each other.  Today Paul even came out to defend Romney's record at Bain.  But the thing that really piqued my interest was Krauthammer's recent comments.  Up until now Krauthammer's comments about Paul have been extremely harsh, but suddenly he seems much more conciliatory.  See the following video: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/11/krauthammer_ron_paul_the_man_who_brought_libertarianism_out_of_the_wilderness.html

The thing that really piqued my interest was around 2:30 Brett Baier asks Kraut what Romney could offer Paul to ""satisfy them"".  Krauthammer floats the possibility that Paul may be given a cabinet position in a Romney administration, or possibly even VP (he emphatically rules out anything related to ""international affairs"" though).

So here's my theory of what's going on:  Paul and Romney have agreed not to attack each other, and if Romney wins the nomination then Paul is guaranteed a position in the admin (unclear what it might be but I would guess something related to domestic financial policy),  In return, Paul agrees not to run third party and brings badly needed support in the under-40 voting block to the ticket (which will be key  if Romney hopes to beat Obama).

I think both the neocons and the libertarians with gnash their teeth at the possibility of this unholy alliance, but I think it's quite plausible.  Thoughts?

This video, will insight more hatred, and will be used by the Afghans as propaganda to turn more people against the US, and to recruit people to kill more American troops.

The ONLY THING GAINED by this video, was to insight more hatred on all sides. I am not sure why we are there in the first place? But I don’t think it is to insight hatred? Unless there is something I don’t understand…

The marines are just paying their respects to those “noble” freedom fighters. I always find it amusing when these muslim jokers feign outrage like this. They’re stone silent when burnt corpses of airmen are hung from bridges or another market place full of people is blown up by a bomb vest wearing jihadi..or another kidnapping or beheading takes place.

If we can inform our reps about the issues coming up, perhaps we could enlighten them before they are 'educated' by lobbyists.  We are citizens- if lobbyists are the only voices our politicians hear, well, that certainly contributes to the problem.

If we can agree on a weekly basis on what our next call should be, we can build momentum as a concerted force- something between active citizenry and lobbying. Politicians recognize our power to influence public dialog. I believe that weekly phone calls not only use that power correctly, but serve to remind our officials that we are always watching.  In addition, weekly phone calls can help create action points for all of the worthwhile issues being brought up in /r/politics, as in 'ACTA only passes with 2/3 vote from the senate, mention it in your weekly call!'.

The topics of our calls can vary. For instance, we can call requesting that our reps not meet with lobbyists on a certain issue, or it could be as simple as informing our representatives that a substantive block of their constituents fervently believe that legislation X is bad/good.

We can't keep putting out fires after they balloon out of control.  We need to start stepping on the embers before lobbyists throw on gasoline.  Further relevant metaphors.  

I studied politics in undergrad and interned in DC at a lobbying firm (then GTFO).  I think weekly, regular phone calls could have a HUGE effect on the system.

Plus it would be interesting to hear opinions on the subject outside of r/space and its related subreddits.

Some things to keep in mind, that space nerds generally know but more mainstream people may not:

1. NASA's budget is less that one tenth of one percent of the national budget.  During the Apollo era it was full 2-3% of the national budget.  One big reason why its not the same as its glory days.

2. When people talk about the Space program and exploring space in the mainstream, they're almost always talking about *manned* space travel.  NASA has had a number of very spectacular successes with robotic probes and automated telescopes through the decades, and almost everyone agrees that should continue more or less as it has been.

3. Every administration since Nixon has overhauled the space program when it took power, resulting in a shake up in the program's goals, budget, resources, projects, and so on every 4 or 8 years.  The robotic probe missions usually slip under the radar, but the manned vehicles almost always got the axe--which is one of the reasons why a Shuttle replacement was talked about for decades but it never came to fruition.  A project to develop one was started under one administration and then killed by the one that came after it, more than once.  This is considered the other big reason why the manned program has foundered.  Space vehicles are among the most advanced and complex machines humankind has ever created, and it takes more than 4-8 years to properly develop and deploy a new class of them.

4. The space program is very much a 50-state endeavor.  Almost all of the states are involved in it in some way, not just Florida as was asserted at the debate.  parts are manufactured all over, tracking stations are position in many regions, as are training facilities, research hubs,, and so on.  This is one area where the libertarian ideal of leaving everything to the states would not work, unless you wanted the US to have greatly diminished space capabilities.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,So What Should Be The Future of the American Space Program?,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ov3nb/so_what_should_be_the_future_of_the_american/,1205938795.0,t2_340ae,,2010

Here goes.

Lately I have been following current events in the ""Worldnews"" section of reddit as I progress to get older in life and am now more interested in what my future may hold (currently 21 years old). I have seen that tensions between the US, EU and some Asian nations have been rising between Iran and some of its Arab/Other allies.

As we all know that Crude Oil (petroleum) is what now fuels and propels our world further and maintains every aspect of life moving foward (ie. transportation, military, indurstrial factories, etc..). Iran being one of the big oil suppliers, if not the biggest (if memory recalls correctly it was 80% regional production), for the Western nations. 

Iran is now currently sanctioned by the US, EU and by some Asian nations that are now following suit.

*Sanction = Iran stops nuclear program, we continue business as usual*

If the sanctions continue to hold out though, causing Iran's economy to plummit making the Iranian economy/industry to search for more outlets (possibly China, Russia and India and surrounding nations). Now keep in mind that Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz and all exports/imports going in and out, would be considered as ""military action against surrounding nations and interference to world trade"".

Of course with the time lapse/delay to find other outlets to export to and recover economic ground again, Iran has been reporting that Isreali agents (along with the help of US/EU agents) have been assassinating Iranian nuclrear scientits in order to drag out Iran's nuclear developement. Which in turn is causing tension between Isreal and Iran.

# Now for the discussion and your opinion #

I speculate several different things could or would happen.

1. Iran would be forced into a corner to where they would open fire on US, EU Naval power in the Strait of Hormuz causing ""another shot that was heard around the world"", escalating the issue into an open firefight (War).

2. Isreal would pull the trigger first on Iran (which Iran said they did assassinating their scientist) pushing both nations to War.  Forcing the US to join Isreal (since we are allies) and involving EU on our side.

3. Now if things got to the point to where open war was declared by the US/EU on Iran/Allies or vice versa, Iran/Allies on US/EU, I believe it would cause a war on multiple fronts, causing more nations to join in this global showdown than what we would imagine leading to a ""WW III"" scenario. Which I would imagine would look like the following;

Keep in mind though, this is only my opinion as I browse /r/WORLDNEWS. It may be that there may not be a war but as things progress the way they are, we may need to prepare ourselves.

- But Redditors, I am asking for your opinion on the current events between our goverments and whether you see it like I do or view the matter differently. I would like to see different opinions from different parts of the world/people -

Abortion is a reality, we devised the medical procedure and it is not only simple but safe to do when done in the correct setting by someone who is well qualified and nothing we do can make it go away.  As long as the procedure exists people will want it and as long as they want it there will be other people willing to provide it.

Throughout our history we have repeatedly seen that prohibition does nothing to solve a problem, why do we think that abortion prohibition would be any different?  People, especially teenagers and those with low incomes, will still have unprotected sex and still not want to ruin their chances at a better future by being saddled with a child.  Should we really punish these people for their lack of planning and understanding?  This lack of planning and understanding, I would like to point out, which our country contributes to by having sub par sexual education and an over reliance on single source birth control (condoms) which still largely requires some amount of money to acquire.

You can argue about whether or not a fetus is a person all you want and in the mean time set reasonable limits for when a person can receive an abortion, however, to outlaw it completely is completely irresponsible, disproportionately punishes the people who need the most help and ignores the real problems and flaws with our system of sexual education and our society's ridiculous hangup with sex.

Basically money is replaced with Credit like any salary, however this credit unlike money is allocated by the state and stored by them, physical money does not exist in any sense its all virtual. 
No private companies, banks or any other organisation exists, only the state and sub sectors each representing the different companies and ""brands"" under economic sectors like the current system to allow choice, similar to communism in this sense. The ""money supply"" is controlled by the nation who set the price of goods based on its use, need, relevant audience or public aim and resources used possibly by a committee of citizens, experts in fields such as doctors, accountants, scientists, media specialists for cultural goods engineers, ect.

Here’s the great part, the Credit system is morally based, its psychological, the state having control of pricing can theoretically charge little to no money for abundant goods or needed goods such as medicine, technologies and food/water and generate a ""negative profit"" on all items sold, so the state could sell medicine for free however having spent millions of credits on scientists salaries. This is where ""pay brackets"" come into play:

The pay bracket is simply yearly credit allocation by the state, it goes from 20,000 credits to 100,000,000 credits, the higher range being designers, scientists, those who receive ""commission"" on designs produced by the state such as by scientists and engineers or CEO's and managers (the rich still exist, but poverty does not). 
This pay is set out by a credit authority who with a jury similar to the court system decide based on records and personal achievement how much a person gets for their work, instead of asking your boss for a rise, you ask the state.

With this system tax no longer exists as the state allocates credit, money being under control of a planned economy only has value to the citizens, the nation has no need for it, to them its simply paper, as a result money no longer holds any power, personal achievement does, to get more money you have to work and excel, and as a direct result the state can spend infinite amount on projects the only limiting factor being resource quantity such as renovating poor cities, towns, building hospitals or even larger projects such as bringing Africa and the Middle east into the 21st century with large rejuvenation projects unaffordable to current governments)

Now to remove the problem of corruption taking place major decisions are controlled by direct democracy, the nation is run similar to that of Switzerland, research the government structure to get the idea, put simply politicians have little power and simply act as a bureaucratic powerhouse acting on their employers the citizens, corruption only occurs with few having control of the many, give many the power and corruption becomes hard to achieve.

Unlike other planned economies this system does not stifle entrepreneurs or designers and developers, they get a credit commission up to 100,000,000 in value for their products per year, they get a mirrored 100% value of the product sold to the public, so if they decide to sell a new soft drink for instance the state would produce the drink (after testing and making sure the public would actually buy it as with investment into any business venture) then the price it is sold at (say 1.40 credits) would be in full given the entrepreneur/s having made the product (the more people being involved splitting the commission between them such as 10% each if 10 people are involved).

The highest salary in this system is 100,000,000 credits a year... being a resource based economy you do not need a salary higher than this as you physically wouldn’t be able to purchase anything over this amount, sports cars, nice houses ect all cost under 100,000,000 with the current system in any case so excessive credit balances are unneeded, this as said is a ""personal salary"" private enterprise no longer exists, being personally worth 100,000,000 a year is impressive by any standards.

Now in order for this system to function you simply need resources... large nations with big resource exploitation would work brilliantly in this system having to be independent from the current global economic system, the two couldn't possibly coincide with each other, this is a new school of economic thought. 

Another possibility of course if global unification which would lead to resources from every continent being pooled into the global resource pot for all 6 billion people to use, under this system poverty would no longer exist, with state allocated money we could pay to create farms, cities and hospitals, gadgets and supplies for everyone in every land mass, the resources do indeed exist and can be properly allocated to sustain our population, we have billions of tonnes of many resources to give everyone a high quality of life.

This may have been proposed in some way before by somebody else however I searched to no avail so here it goes.  

The problem with modern day politics as I see it is the lack of power the voter has for interaction with his/her representative and their voting preference once they have been elected into power. SOPA is a prime example and even with huge amount of pressure being put on the American congress something will ultimately get passed (perhaps a watered down version or through being attached another bill). What I propose is a way of allowing the electorate to vote on any bill (be it in congress or parliament) and prevent toxic and dangerous laws being made. Being from the UK for my example I will use a simplified parliamentary system, but this can be applied to any publicly elected voting body.  

When a bill comes to a vote (and I have a few other ideas on reviews etc. that involve the public but I will leave that out for now) the percentage vote to pass will be that of the parliament plus public vote combined. The weighting of the public vote will be determined as a ratio of the percentage of the electorate that voted on the bill. E.g. A parliament has 1000 seats in total, 499 of these are taken up by MP’s (elected through standard means) and the remainder are the public’s. Say each election 20million people vote, for one of these seats to be included in a vote at least 20,000,000/501 (roughly 40,000) would need to vote (these are only example figures, better ones can be calculated that make things fair and reasonable). This way, in the event of a controversial bill, should the public vote heavily in opposition they can actually have an effect.  

This in turn can lead onto other reforms, but ultimately we start with the biggest injustice in the current system, the lack of power given to the voter.  

Online systems could be easily developed to accomplish this with comment sections, videos for/against issues from leading campaigners and safety mechanisms in place to ensure people actually read and understand the bills (basic question/answers, timers on pages etc.).  

Anyway, that’s the idea in its raw form, it requires work and fleshing out but what are your thoughts. Be gentle, this is my first time.  

TLDR: Give the people a way to vote on parliamentary/congressional bills that can overpower the vote of those elected.

Disclaimer 2: I am writing this from personal notes, I will look for the sources referenced later today when I'm out of class and incorporate them into the OP.

I am a freshman studying Political Science at the Oxford College branch of Emory University. I am currently taking a class called Oxford Studies, which has me attend lectures on various topics throughout the semester. Last night I attended a lecture titled ""*How Singapore Delivers the Best Medical Care in the World While Spending 80% Less Than We Do.*"" The speaker, Ph.D of economics professor Sean Flynn, delivered his idea for an overhaul of the health care system in the United States, along with various studies and sources to prove that it's feasible. I would like to submit it to you guys to see if you can come up with holes in his argument, or look at ways that his idea could be implemented.

**Now, TL;DR(or table of contents, idc):** 

**Point one: Singapore provides the best health care as measured by the World Health Organization, while spending 80% less of their GDP than the United States.**

**Point two: A system similar to theirs could be implemented in the United States, and in two prominent examples already has. The majority of the plan is implementable without changing any existing laws.**

**Point three: The probable results of implementing his plan on a country-wide level are the following: 35% less personal expenditures on health care. 60% fewer emergency room and physician visits. Generic drug costs lowered by, on average, $18. Reclaiming of at least 8% of the United States GDP. Downsides (although you may not see them as downsides): it eliminates the insurance industry.**


Okay, now the long version.

To begin with, let me give you the background of the speaker. Quoting from his website's bio: [""A recurring commentator on NPR, FOX Business, and ABC News, Sean holds a B.A. in economics from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. in economics from U.C. Berkeley, where he completed his dissertation under the supervision of 2001 Nobel Laureate George Akerlof.""](http://pages.scrippscollege.edu/~sflynn/about.html)

All of the statistics and studies that I quote are from my notes taken during his lecture, but all of them are easily found with some internet research as they primarily draw from government sites. Any source will be put in parentheses, giving the name of the source until I find all of the original pages.


* To begin with, here are some basic facts. First, the United States spends 18% of its GDP on health care. Singapore spends 4%. And yet, for some reason, Singapore ranks higher than the U.S. in almost every single measurement of health care, including cost per patient, cost of drugs, life expectancy, and quality of life. (World Health Organization)

* Next, he moved on to discuss why the United States health care system is so bad. First, the United States is under a third party payer system. When this term is used, the first party is the patient, the second is the doctor, and the third is the insurance company (or the government for medicare recipients). When you use a third party, there is room to increase costs; simple middleman theory.

* Second, he looked at why United States companies offer health care plans. In very few countries do the citizens think of health care as being something you get from your place of work. The reason that we have a system like this in the United States dates back to WWII. During WWII, there was a period (i think he said four years) where the government fixed wages. No moving wages meant there was no way to attract skilled workers. Companies compensated when they realized that there was a loophole in the law that allowed them to offer health care as a benefit. It has remained that way ever since.

* Third, corporations are still able to claim insurance premiums as tax deductions. Individuals, however, are not. This again encourages the role of health care to remain with a business. Since a company can claim insurance premiums as deductible, that means it costs less for a company to provide insurance than it would for an individual. 

* Fourth, and most importantly, low out of pocket costs for health care make the system look artificially cheap, encouraging superfluous and excessive health care usage. Out of pocket costs have plummeted in recent history from 47% to 12%. (U.S. government source) The entire reason behind why Singapore's system has been effective revolves around this fundamental truth, which will be upheld in the examples provided later: people spend less money when it's their own money being spent.


Now, I'm going to give you a brief description of the Singapore health care system.

1. Singapore requires all citizens to pay a percentage of their income into a private health savings account. This private savings account generates interest, and upon the death of the holder, the money held in it can be willed to the next of kin. Should disastrous circumstances drain the account of all funds, the government picks up the tab.

2. Singapore enters each citizen into a high deductible insurance plan. The deductible is the amount that you would pay before the insurance kicks in. In their case, this deductible is about $2,500. That amount would be drawn from the private health savings account.

3. The poor's insurance is covered by the government.

4. The government forces health care providers to display all true costs of every service. When entering a clinic or a hospital, you will see health care ""menus"" on the wall, displaying the costs of each procedure and treatment. This means that the consumer (the patient) can shop around hospitals for the lowest price, which also stimulates competition between health care providers, thus lowering costs for the consumer.

5. In addition the ""menus"" listed above, there are websites where you can view additional information about each provider, including doctor reviews, costs, lawsuits, and the rate of complications for each procedure. This is a major point, the competition drastically improves care.

6. Hospitals upsell luxury care to the rich, to subsidize the treatments for the poor. For example, a bed in a room with 6 other patients might cost $80 a night, whereas a private suite might cost $1400 a night. An American example of this is our airline system. First class tickets cost substantially more, proportionately, than economy class tickets. This in turn subsidizes those economy class tickets.

(**Keep in mind that Singapore is only spending 4% of their GDP on health care related costs, so obviously the system doesn't cause undue financial stress to their economy**)


(I'm going to edit in the two main examples where this type of system has been tried in the U.S. soon. Going through and editing for content now.) 


**Now, for the examples of where this has been implemented in the United States. First:**

The US company Whole Foods implemented a system similar to the Singapore model. It functioned in the following way:

1. All employees were entered into a insurance plan that covered all expenses after a $2,500 deductible. 

2. The company gave each employee the following benefit: $1,800 per year is deposited in a private wellness account. This PWA rolls over yearly, meaning the amount available for spending on health care increases if you save the money.

3. A doughnut hole of $700 (the gap between the money given and the $2,500 deductible) encouraged prudence on the part of the workers with regard to health care treatments. They no longer would take their kids in every time they got scratched, or when they had a cold. 

4. It was found that of the employees that were under this plan, health care expenditures **decreased by 35%**.


**Unfortunately, Whole Foods did not look at whether or not these savings meant people weren't taking care of themselves. Which is why we now look at the second example of implementation in the US:**


The state of Indiana began offering their employees a new health care plan. It operated under the following methods: 

1. $2,750 in a private wellness plan deposited yearly, rolling over annually.
2. Private insurance plan with $8,000 deductible
3. Doughnut hole of $5,250
4. Co-pay of 20%.

The end result meant that in an absolute worst case scenario, individual expenditures could only hit $1,050 in one year. This was a family plan. 

**The first year that this program was offered, only 2% of the state employees signed up. Word of mouth was so effective, that the second year, that percentage increased to 70%.**

The Governor, who implemented this plan, then decided to do a followup survey of the results. He found the following:

* Members of this plan spent 35% less on health care

* There were 67% fewer emergency room visits

* Hospital admissions by members dropped 50%

* By offering access to generic drugs, individual prescriptions cost $18 less, on average

* There was NO evidence of deferring preventative care.

* The state of Indiana reduced their health care expenditures by 13%. 


**To conclude his presentation of the evidence, Professor Flynn told us that there has in fact, been a randomized test to determine whether or not it is true that the fundamental principle behind this plan is true; that people will spend less money if it's their own**

Some years ago, the think-tank RAND (also credited with developing the concept of mutually assured destruction) did a randomized study of behaviors in health care recipients. The results of this survey reinforced all the previous points made. When the parameters were set so that it appeared as though the patient were spending more of their OWN money, health care expenditures dropped dramatically.  
  
  
In conclusion, this entire system relies on accepting a analysis of human behavior that revolves around this statement: people spend less money when it's their own. The projections for implementation of this system are stated in the TL;DR.

I am an American and I this is my manifesto for a more just future. It has been of the opinion for some time that America is lacking in the kind of constitutional authority we once fought and died for, we've repeatedly tried voting for it but after these campaigns against whistle blowers, the once unused rules kicking citizen journalists (albeit one working for HBO) our of public lawmaker hearings and orders from police officers to groups of protestors to disperse for no other reason than that they were protesting at the wrong time. It's a known fact that America is one of the older democracies and our constitution is in shambles. We have endurance because we live here and our relentless pursuit of information will not be slowed, not by SOPA, not by PIPA, and not by the ACTA. I call for this revolution so that America can live up to the promises it made me and the world. I call for this revolution for all the freedom fighters who in the name of honor did their duty and served the constitution over what some corrupt law told them to do. We will not be silenced by an oppressive King, the one who gets to decide if we go to war (definition of war is when you bomb things) or not, we were so warned against.

“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”

These words meant more in 1776 but today they are an abstraction. Establish Justice? Our country bombs other countries based on what their government asks us to. There's no justice. It is said that every time you witness an act you feel is unjust you become a party to injustice. America has become a party to injustice when they would lock someone away for telling us what our democratic government does in our name. See something? Say something. A government that can't listen to it's own advice isn't one worth keeping around, it's time to spring forward.

In this constitution we have 10 amendments, and of these 10 amendments most Americans would want to keep all of them. Aside from the gun laws which, while I may totally agree with lots of what lots of people say the reality is that guns are getting easier for people to obtain, it's really really clear from the number of guns sold across the states that we're not under as much threat there as other amendments. I don't prefer a revolution with guns, but if the guy next to me wants his revolution with a side of firearm I will support his right to do so. If gun sales go down I'll rant about guns but I come from the generation where technology will overcome all obstacles, I don't deny how naive that can be. So long as we have the freedom to speak, to share and to collaborate these weapons are far more effective against a government that in many cases thinks it's acceptable to use that kind of violence against us (which is of course my biggest reason for supporting gun rights in general, because they get to have guns too).

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. “

Congress is trying to make laws that prohibit speech, it's cleverly rephrased as copyright protection which they recently expanded to mean 70 years after the death of the artist. They want to throw people in jail for it and they don't care if you're guilty or innocent or even the party in question. This is unacceptable on many levels. You will be punished however unjustly because other people want to own ideas forever and you're getting in the way. Peaceably assemble? Look at what they do to the Occupy protestors, they're licking their chops at the idea of so many people in such a small space, making up orders of dispersal, cornering in and loading public transit buses full of active community members calling out for a better world. Get out the riot gear and use up all that riot training from the DHS. Police states silence critics and it's what we've been doing with Bradly Manning, the most important whistle blower of our generation. Without him we wouldn't know about the way our government murders people and then lies to us. The way our government promotes a fake free market while 'our' state department lobby’s Russia on behalf of visa and mastercard, IN OUR NAME promoting the duopoly that is our electronic money system. These truths against our first amendment rights are unacceptable and I will fight until I can't to get them back. Freedom of Speech would be nothing without our right to publish.

“No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law. “

It might seem odd to tackle the 3rd amendment but after the most recent NDAA this line is further blurred. If the military should be allowed the power to detain Americans on our soil we have gone to war with ourselves. What happens when the DHS checkpoints run out of room and your house is situated in the perfect spot. Other than this sentence, there's nothing stopping them from trying.

“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. “

You need only look at the TSA to know we are not safe against unreasonable searches. You need only look to the internet to know the DHS or ICE or whatever they want to call themselves today repeatedly disrespects families and our rights. There is no such probable cause anymore, there are only no knock warrants that kill veterans, checkpoints setup to check the citizenship 'just in case'. Guilty until proven innocent. This in unacceptable. These rights are not suggestions, we did not stutter and I will not rest until all Americans can feel safe in their cell phones, airplanes and cars as well as our persons, houses, papers and effects.

“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”

The infamous Grand Jury, a process that has been swept into secrecy and it seems that a Grand Jury can be called for just about anything these days, there's no transparency even after the facts. You don't get to challenge it in any way. Even if you have the best lawyers you're kept in the dark until your trial. It's all a stalling tactic, it's an obvious abuse of an out of control government. It's unacceptable. We are depriving many of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. It's called Guantanamo Bay. It's called the NYPD, it's called the OPD, it's called the SPD as seen this last occupy season with their makeshift camps that couldn't even provide enough shelter food and water for all the people they were so eager to arrest. Holding them until the courts say they can't hold them anymore, just to take as many of us off the streets as possible, to subject as many as they can to humiliation, to discourage people from taking more actions in the future. WE MUST BE STRONGER. We must outlast their destruction of our constitution. We must not forget war resisters. We must seek justice for those this unjust system punishes for fun. We must end the assault on our 5th amendment rights.

“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.”

Our right to a trial has been squashed. Marijuana activists haven't got their hearing since before I was born. We have had people in custody one way or another for longer than a decade. This is one of our worst kept farces. District attorneys use their power to force non-violent offenders into thinking it's in their interest to plea because it's easier for them. This type of coercion is unacceptable and in a just world we would all look out for each other, these superficial motives that would seek to unjustly punish someone with loss of life or liberty because you're smarter than them in a legal sense is backwards from the justice we are to aspire to. Mandatory minimums, jury nullification on grounds that you think you'll lose because 1 or 2 of the people on the jury clearly wouldn't support sending a non-violent crack addict to jail for 20 years. We could stand to be more transparent and open about these processed, if the state has nothing to hide it should, if they continue to shroud themselves in secrecy or bury us in bureaucracy we have every right to be angry about it.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,Manifesto For An American Spring Pt. 1,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/p7s1c/manifesto_for_an_american_spring_pt_1/,1328197064.0,t2_6tk5o,,2010

Here are the requirements for Pennsylvania. Are these pretty much standard across the states? Have these requirements proved useful to make sure the ballot is kept clean of candidates with no support, or do pieces get used to block small party or individual candidates? Do you feel that candidate requirements need to be changed at all to make any sort of electoral reform worthwhile?

**Filing Fees and Signature Requirements for Nomination Petitions**     
        Signature requirements vary depending on the office for which the nomination petition is being circulated.

**The Candidates Affidavit**
           Each candidate must file with his or her nomination petition or nomination paper an affidavit setting forth information about the candidate, including the candidate’s residence, election district and the name of the office the candidate is seeking.

**The Statement of Financial Interests** 
            The Statement of Financial Interests is a form that must be filed with the State Ethics Commission, which requires the filer to set forth information regarding the filer’s sources of income.  A copy of the completed Statement of Financial Interests must also accompany the nomination petition of a candidate for state, county or local public office. 

**Nomination Petitions and Nomination Papers; Filing Deadlines**
        A nomination petition is filed by a candidate seeking access to a primary ballot.  Nomination papers are filed by candidates of minor political parties and political bodies for the purpose of gaining access to the ballot in a November election. Nomination petitions must be circulated and filed between the 13th Tuesday and the 10th Tuesday preceding the primary.

My current personal take on this issue is abort away as long as you have a valid reason to, I say this not as a cold hearted killer but as a person who realizes the importance of childhood development and the stresses/burdens that this can bring to the parents. I feel that even having questions whether you could raise a child properly should warrant a discussion with your partner of an abortion. 

Having done my part of keeping child free I am appalled by the figures of newborns and children growing up on government assistance. Again not here to punish the children but the irresponsible parents who bring a life into the world even though they cannot take care of it themselves. I do not want to pay for the mistakes of people, if you feel that your baby is a gift from god etc. you should ask for donations from your particular congregation that fuels these views in you and not expect the rest of the country to pay for this. 

You see my turn for the dark but here's the idea that's been floating in my head. (Again I do not feel like having kids is something that should be for the rich but definitely should be limited to the responsible people). So here's the proposition...

I am willing to support a Pro Life position only if the government limits the financial assistance to one child only. The first child should be enough of a litmus test to see the true costs of a child and whether or not you can afford, take care and raise the subsequent ones on your own. Furthermore you would have to leave a few conditions that allows women to have abortions: who have been raped, or have medical conditions that jeopardizes the mothers/babys life, or have any sort of deformity/trauma/disease that jeopardizes the health of the baby outside of the womb. 

Is this something that the average public can agree with? Or have I gone down the deep left end?

Why does this situation warrant concern?  And why from conservatives, of all people?

First, idealogically, if Conservatives believe in the second amendment, the right of persons to bear arms for self defense, why don't they believe in the right of nations to bear nuclear arms for self defense?

Second, historically, arms races usually precede wars, but rather than being a CAUSE of conflicts, they are both a result of deeper issues and, usually, act as a counter balance to maintain peace.  Iran, even if they have nukes, is unlikely to use them unless required for self defense.  Yes, their president called for the destruction of Israel.  However, that's just as much political jockeying and appealing to their ignorant voter base as is American politicans threatening to invade Iran, and it makes every bit as much sense as a legitimate foreign policy.

The only likely negative outcome of an Iranian nuclear arsenal is if a nuclear weapon, either intentionally or otherwise, were to wind up in the hands of a terrorist group, which Iran has been known to support through material aid in the recent past.   However, we have to ask ourselves, which is a greater threat to American National security?  The likelihood that Iran will a, develop a nuclear weapon AND b, give/lose it to a terrorist organization AND c, that terrorist organization will manage to successfully smuggle it into America and detonate it, OR giving the world's Muslim population a third, poorly justified war for which to hate us AND spending over a trillion dollars on needless military expenditures AND losing the lives of thousands or (this is IRAN here) tens of thousands of soldies AND leaving ourselves more vulnerable to other security threats AND quite possibly PREVOKING the nuclear catastrophy that politicans will claim they are trying to PREVENT.  Which of these is most likely to cause the most damage to America?

Having a strong interest in such matters, It drew my attention. The author, James Q. Wilson, argues that the taxing of the wealthy won't end poverty. As I read it, I realized that his views and habits of thought when it comes to the issue of poverty is very identical to that of the masses in general, r/politicaldiscussion included.

&gt;But the mere existence of income inequality tells us little about what, if anything, should be done about it. First, we must answer some key questions. Who constitutes the prosperous and the poor? Why has inequality increased? Does an unequal income distribution deny poor people the chance to buy what they want? And perhaps most important: How do Americans feel about inequality?

I wouldn't consider how Americans feel about inequality to be the most important consideration on the topic of poverty. Wilson along with most people have accepted, though not explicitly, that poverty is only natural and that someone MUST be poor. And so there are those who advocate [Robin-Hood-like taxes](http://robinhoodtax.org/how-it-works) to help/give the poor and those like Wilson who stress the importance of income mobility.

&gt;To answer these questions, it is not enough to take a snapshot of our incomes; we must instead have a motion picture of them and of how people move in and out of various income groups over time...

&gt;Mobility is not limited to the top-earning households. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that nearly half of the families in the lowest fifth of income earners in 2001 had moved up within six years. Over the same period, more than a third of those in the highest fifth of income-earners had moved down. Certainly, there are people such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates who are ensconced in the top tier, but far more common are people who are rich for short periods.

The bottom fifth according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Quintiles) is $0 - $18,500. Most people like to define poverty as a number or dollar amount/range without actually explaining what the numbers mean with reference to food, clothing, shelter, etc.

&gt;The real income problem in this country is not a question of who is rich, but rather of who is poor. Among the bottom fifth of income earners, many people, especially men, stay there their whole lives. Low education and unwed motherhood only exacerbate poverty, which is particularly acute among racial minorities...

&gt;Making the poor more economically mobile has nothing to do with taxing the rich and everything to do with finding and implementing ways to encourage parental marriage, teach the poor marketable skills and induce them to join the legitimate workforce. It is easy to suppose that raising taxes on the rich would provide more money to help the poor. But the problem facing the poor is not too little money, but too few skills and opportunities to advance themselves.

Also the general belief amongst the masses including Obama himself, is that if only poor people had more education and more degrees, all these problems would take care of themselves without realizing that degrees do not create their own demand. No one seems to understand the concept of academic inflation.

The point of this post is that poverty, the lack of or difficulty in securing the basic necessities of human life like food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, etc. is not natural. Why isn't anyone asking why poverty increases when the aggregate wealth of society is increasing? Why the association? Does it not puzzle anyone that abundance brings along with it poverty? Where you find the greatest wealth is where is you find the sharpest struggle for existence amongst the lowest classes, why is that? We have solved the problem of production, why hasn't it banished want? Why are we having to work more and more hours to secure the barest necessities of life instead of working less and less as material progress would suggest? Any ideas?

Jobs, jobs, jobs. Republican candidates have repeatedly made the following assertion: Obama is harming employment rates.

Now, either I am developing a particularly early case of deafness, or they are utterly incorrect. 

Here's a few simple facts about unemployment. Source : [Google-compiled statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;tdim=true&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:S&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=unemployment+rate)


* President George W. Bush took office in January 2001. **Unemployment: 4.2%**
* President George W. Bush left office, and President Barack Obama took office in January, 2009. **Unemployment: 7.8%** 


**Unemployment then proceeded to peak at 10% in October 2009. Since then, as of today, unemployment fell to 8.5%.**


The time frame of January 2009 to October 2009 is too short of a time frame to reasonably expect Obama's economic policies to have made an impact. 

Let's look at this way:

From when Bush took office to when he left office, unemployment rose 3.6%. When Barack Obama took office, unemployment rose 2.2%, and since then has decreased by 1.5%.

Besides the isolated reasons why people are wrong like ""Bush put us in a recession"", no he didn't you fucking idiot that was Senator Dodd. Or the ""Obama is spending too much what a stupid prick he's the reason my business is doing bad"", He's not spending it all by himself you douchebag.

It's just painful to watch stupid Americans say stupid shit. So here are my two reasons why I don't think you can blame economic issues expressly on Presidents.

The first is simple enough. The President doesn't have a power that allows him to directly affect the economy, he simply doesn't. The closest he can get is to present certain bills to Congress, or sign/veto bills that affect the economy, but either way it comes down to The House and the Senate.

The second reason is that the economy has a natural ebb and flow, called the business cycle, it happens once every 7-9 years in America from trough to trough with a recession, recovery and peak in between them. So that's another reason why because simply put, the economy is g oing to do its thing even if effected it will still recede (maybe more from bad decisions), but nonetheless that is not the President either.

So no, Obama didn't ""FIX"" the economy that Bush ""RUINED"", and No, Obama isn't ""Keeping unemployment at 8.5%"", they simply aren't doing that.

Being a conservative or libertarian on internet communities like Reddit that are largely left-leaning can be somewhat cumbersome for a guy like me, but there is one thing that is truly beneficial- a very vocal desire for what people on the other side of the table believe and want. Now, the Fair Tax does have somewhat bi-partisan support, but the vast majority of supporters lean to the right. Perhaps this simple fact turns off potential left-wing supporters before they even properly understand it. Maybe it's time that those on the left give a different approach to taxation a fair consideration.

Here are 5 big things about the Fair Tax that I believe alines perfectly with liberal and progressive principles.

**1- Money is Power:** Think of all the ways politicians use taxation to influence your actions and the actions of corporations. Sometimes this is a discouragement for gaining more success, but sometimes it is an encouragement for giant corporations to spend millions on tax lawyers to get them to pay next to nothing. GE earned $14.2 billion in profits in 2010, but it paid not a penny in taxes because the bulk of those profits, some $9 billion, were offshore. In fact, GE got a $3.2 billion tax benefit. Sure, the loopholes GE benefited from can be eliminated, but more will be found, and these companies will always find a way out of paying their ""fair share"". Not to mention, companies will still lobby to open up new tax breaks. That's a fundamental problem with our tax system. The only way to end *all* ridiculous loopholes and tax-break lobbying in the tax system is to get rid of the current income tax. 

**2- The end of the tyrannical IRS:** I hear the term ""police state"" a lot, but it's not often a term associated with the IRS. Well, maybe it should be- The IRS is a giant bureaucracy with 144,000 armed agents empowered to seize the assets of and jail those who fail to comply with an indecipherable mess of a tax code that is next to impossible for the average citizen to understand on their own. The Fair Tax would end the IRS as we know it. No more men with guns coming after grandma because she didn't file her taxes correctly.

**3- More money in your pocket, more revenue for government spending:** Whether your rich or poor, liberal or conservative, atheist or Christian, *everyone* likes coming home with more money in their pocket at the end of the day. When's the last time you got angry when your boss gave you a raise??? The elimination of all income taxes (including the regressive payroll tax) means that all Americans will see what they truly earn in their paycheck. Also, after over a decade of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on research, the Fair Tax is devised to be revenue neutral for the first year of operation. It raises the same amount of revenue as is raised by current law. So you don't have to worry about social programs going under due to lack of funding by change in the tax code. In fact, after the first year, revenue is expected to *rise* because of the growth generated by this plan. At that time the American people, the Congress, and the president will have to decide whether to lower the tax rate or to spend the additional revenue. Either way, it's a win/win!

**4- Elimination of class division/envy:** This is something that most people don't think about, but the current income tax is a class defining nightmare that puts everyone against one another. The lower class and middle class resent the upper class and the wealthy for not paying their ""fair share"", while the tax paying upper and upper-middle classes resent the nearly 50% of Americans who pay next to nothing at all. This is what happens when you tax people on what they earn, rather than what they spend. With the exception of those in poverty, The Fair Tax would practically eliminate defined classes in America and provide a common ground for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds to come together to hold the government accountable for it's spending.

**5- More beneficial to the poor:** Opponents of the Fair Tax use claim of the Fair Tax being ""regressive"" as their primary argument for keeping the current tax code. Fortunately, they're wrong. Not only is the Fair Tax ""progressive"" (the rich pay more, the poor pay less), it's actually way more *beneficial* to the poor than our current system! [Take a look!](http://www.fairtax.org/images/content/pagebuilder/10457.gif) The benefits to the poor with the Fair Tax is largely due to two factors- the removal of the truly regressive payroll tax, and the implementation of a prebate system. This is one reason that the proposal of a flat tax is loosing ground to the Fair Tax. Because it still includes the regressive payroll tax, a flat tax is more harmful to the poor.

I really hope a fair amount of people see this, as the Fair Tax is legislation that I believe to be truely bi-partisan and beneficial to every single American.

If I have rightly understood, the King's attorney has framed an indictment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by imprisonment, these three inoffensive persons before the bar of this court for a crime of great magnitude - as disturbers of the peace.  May it please the court -what did I hear read?  Did I hear it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own?  Did I hear an expression, as of a crime, that these men, whom your worships are to try for misdemeanor, are charged with, with what? Preaching the Gospel of the Son of God.
   May it please your worships,in a day like this when truth is about to burst its fetters, when mankind is about to be aroused to claim their natural and inalienable rights, when the yoke of oppression that has reached the wilderness of America, and unnatural alliance of ecclesiastical and civil power are about to be dissevered, at such a period, when liberty of conscience is about to wake from her slumberings it requires into reason of such charges as I find exhibited here today in this indictment.
   If I am not deceived, according to the contents of the paper I now hold in my hand, these men are accused of Preaching the Gospel of the Sons of God, Great God.
   May it please your worships, there are periods in history of man, where corruption and depravity have so long debased the human character, that man sinks under the weight of the oppressors hand, becomes his servile, his abject slave, he licks the hand that smites him, he bows in passive obedience to the mandates of the despot, and in this state of servility he receives his fetters of personal bondage, but may it please your worships - such a day has passed away.

Were it not for this, in vain were all the sufferings and bloodshed to subjugate this New World, if we their offspring must still be oppressed and persecuted.  But may it please your worships, permit me to inquire once more for what are these men about to be tried?  This paper says for preaching the gospel of the Savior to Adam's fallen race.

The 35.8 percent claim is a straight out lie by the media.  First, the top marginal federal income tax rate is 35%.  This means she made above $379,000 adjusted gross income.  This is is hardly an example of you and I.  Second, Buffet earned (allegedly) most of his money via capitol gains, which according to the [IRS](http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106799,00.html) can be as low as 0% if you are a low wage earner.  So even the cap gains tax is somewhat progressive. So if he paid 17% in federal taxes, he paid the highest rate possible, likely higher than the less wealthy.  The two percent must be on salary.   Neither he nor Obama are clear about these rates.

At any rate, his secretary is hardly an example of you and I.  His point about her taxes is misleading.  She is considered wealthy, AND is paying 5% higher taxes than the 30% minimum Obama was asking for (he never really differentiates capitol gains from regular income.  So we can only assume he means marginal tax rate, unless he states differently).

Gingrich has his core group of supporters who love a loudmouth who will take on ""the media"" and see Romney as a bit of a pushover who supported Obamacare and was Pro Choice. The evangelicals like Santorum because he parrots the common talking points that even the rest of the pack know are too stupid to take (Banning pornography, and basically wanting to implement a Christian version of Sharia law). Ron Paul supporters are, well, pretty devoted to their candidate and I can't imagine many of them being swayed to vote for Romney or Gingrich.

* Government should invest more in public education and should make higher education more affordable through grants.
* Government should invest more in science and technology, especially clean and renewable energy technology. It should also spend more on infrastructure.

I grew up in a conservative family and developed liberal views in college.  I still get crap for voting for Obama in 2008.

As time goes on, I get more interested in politics, and now that I'm supposed to be a real person, I have to stick with what the government can do/will do/is doing for mainly the job market and for the massive debt graduates are in.  I voted for Obama the first time because I agreed with his ideals for Iraq and education and while he has been doing some things, there is a lot we haven't seen.

After watching the State of the Union address last night (legitimately watching for once), there are indeed many things that Obama said that are instantly appealing.  From helping with student loans, to putting the now unneeded, vast military budget to good use, he set many hefty goals.  I know he also challenged the ""no nothing"" Congress to do something, and he even gave attention to the Occupy Wall Street protests.  I do realize, too, that many of the things he challenged Congress to do will probably *not* happen - as much as I'd like to see it actually take place.  He spoke of tax incentives, tax breaks for the right class, and other plans to bolster our American economy.

But then you have the Republican response.  I didn't pay as much attention, but what I got between the liberal use of a large vocabulary was that Obama's plans won't help the country, but dig an even larger hole that we will never recover from.  Mentions of the housing crisis, debt, and other plans were a focus.

Basically, as someone who is still developing his political views, what should I be looking for from Obama this year?  What needs to happen for him to keep my vote?  Obviously if I don't see *something* happen, that lessens the chance I vote Democrat.  There are many things I would love to see happen, especially the reinvestment in American industry and more assistance given to students in debt, but what is the chance I'll actually see progress this year?  He's created a lofty set of goals for himself and Congress this election year, and I don't want to end up like I was at the end of the Packers season... disappointed.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,"As a recent college grad who doesn't pay as much attention to politics as he should, what does Obama need to do to keep my vote in November?",http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/owwf3/as_a_recent_college_grad_who_doesnt_pay_as_much/,1266958929.0,t2_3wjnm,,2010

This also cuts about 100k federal employees. I'd take it a step further and also completely eliminate the DEA, the ATF, and a few other agencies that Paul doesn't completely eliminate.

So now you've cut $1tril from the deficit. What's the next best thing to do? Well, we're going to need some additional revenue. Let's get rid of the Bush tax cuts. We're now down 1.4 Trillion dollars from the deficit.

Now time for the stimulus part.

So, we've cut the deficit by $1.4trillion. Let's take half of that money and reinvest it. $500billion in infrastructure projects. Part of the conditions of the funds are that no person may make more than $80k/yr off of these funds, and no supplies may be bought at more than 1.3x market value. I'm not 100% sure on how to determine market value of construction supplies, but I'm sure that there is some way to determine it. There's one other mandate that I would attach to the funds, but I unfortunately don't have the statistics to give hard numbers. I would like to find the average amount of supplies used in a construction project that are manufactured in the US, and multiply it by 1.5x. This would mean that if, on average, 30% of supplies used in construction were made in the US, the infrastructure projects would be required to buy 45% of supplies from American manufacturers. 

Now, at this point, we've reinvested $500billion out of $1.4trillion cut. Take another $200billion, and we're going to start a new space agency. I'm of the belief that there is a point at which a bureaucracy becomes salvageable, and I think NASA is past that point. Nasa's current budget is about $20bil/yr, so it should be totally unproblematic to transfer various useful and essential NASA projects to the new agency, while still cutting funds. Let's say the cost of these projects is $15bil, and the cost of creating and organizing the new agency is $5bil. I'm completely making these numbers up, but we're talking about a $200bil/yr budget, so a few billion shouldn't make that much of a difference.

Now, this new space agency is created with two tasks in mind. The first is to create permanent manned research stations on Mars. There is no reason why we shouldn't be trying to put men on Mars, and there would be no shortage of brilliant minds looking to explore Mars. We've been creating probes for decades, it's time for a manned mission. 

The second major purpose of this agency is to build probes designed to explore the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. If there is life to be found in our solar system, it's going to be on those moons. 

**tl,dr:** So, now we've cut the yearly budget by $700billion, and are investing an extra $500billion/yr in infrastructure projects and American manufacturing, and $200bil/yr on space exploration, including a manned mission to mars.

I have plenty of other ideas as well, including a Social Security reform that allows people to opt-out of SS, but if you are above a certain income, you have to pay half of your payroll tax anyway. This would take rich people, who live the longest and reap the most benefits from the system, out of Social Security, while still forcing them to pay something into the system.

I edited the video and put it together with a song, [Goodnight and Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqjWodek8ZM) by Imogen Heap.  The entire clip came out to be one minute and fifteen seconds long.

I uploaded the video to my wife's Facebook account and within a few minutes after the video was processed their system detected the use of the song and subsequently removed the video. They sent an email containing the following:

&gt; We have removed your video entitled ""[removed] can't stay awake."" uploaded at 1:29pm February 11th, 2012. We did this because it appears to contain copyrighted material owned by a third party, such as a video clip or background audio.

After that notice I uploaded the same video to YouTube to try my luck there.  YouTube detected the song was owned by SME, but they didn't remove the video.  Looking into what actions would be taken I found the following:

&gt; No action is required on your part. Your video is still available worldwide. In some cases ads may appear next to your video.

Once I confirmed the video wasn't going to be removed we shared the link to it on my wife's Facebook account.  Five minutes after sharing it a friend of my wife posted this comment:

&gt; ""*How cute. So cute. What's the name of that song?*""

Her friend had not heard of Imogen Heap or her music until today.

I'm glad we were able to share the video clip with our friends and family, but I'm still left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Why I think this is ridiculous:

1. Copyright owners aren't the ones policing their content.  Facebook and YouTube are doing it for them.  

2. This was for personal, non-commercial use and I didn't use the whole song.  I used approximately one third of it.  Yes, I know I don't have a right to use someone else's work, however…

3. Unless SME changes their minds, they're okay with me using the song in the video.  Facebook needlessly removed the video.

4. Within five minutes of posting the YouTube link this video had turned a new person onto Imogen Heap's work.  **Five minutes**.  Imogen Heap isn't a household name, who knows how many of my wife's friends will become aware of her work and become fans of it.  Even if it's only one person I'd wager that one new fan was worth the handful of times that video will be viewed.

1)	We must first accept we are living in a Capitolocracy not a Democracy.  This is a land where money has more votes-power than “One person one vote” as in a real democracy. 

2)	Tax Reform….Flat tax with no exemptions. All taxes, personal, industry, etc. should be paid locally to their respective county government, thus spreading the tax burden, yet retaining some local control.

3)	States tax their respective counties, for revenue.

4)	The Feds. {IRS} tax only the 50 states.  By doing so we have a more just system of checks and balances with less concentration of power within the beltway.  Lobbyist influence and the money grab associated with it will be greatly diluted and diminished.

5)	Eliminate local town governments and their feudal power base and all the duplication of resources this represents throughout the states. 

6)	County commissioner’s term limits…Three years per term, two max.

7)	Senators term limits….Five years per term, two max.

8)	The election process should be limited to 12 months for national seats.

9)	Incorporate strict public financing limits on all political races.

10)	All states and the federal government must subscribe, by law, to “generally accepted accounting rules”

11)	Tort reform must be enacted.

12)	There should be created five regional councils, Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, and Southwest.  This is not to be another layer of government.  Every one of these regions have their individual needs environmentally that can only be addressed with a total effort of all parties within their respective regions.

13)	Do not interfere with the internal affairs of sovereign nations without 
international approval.
            
14)	FAIR TRADE, not free trade.

14)	America First policy for economic development.

15)	Reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

16)	Decriminalize marijuana. 

Keiser Report is great!

One measurement that people like to bandy about on a regular basis is the unemployment rate. So how accurate are the claims we hear about what happened to the unemployment rate under each president? I realize that this information will not take into account all information that contributed to the unemployment rate, but it still gives us something to work with. Let's have a look.

These numbers will also include information about [what political party controlled the House and Senate during the Presidential term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Presidents_and_control_of_Congress#Comparing_presidential_ranking_with_congressional_control_and_terms_won.2Fserved). If the House was aligned with the same party as the President for four years, then it will say Number of years with House: 4. If it was in opposition, then it will say Number of years House opposed: 4.

I will be looking at [compiled data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;tdim=true&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:S&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=unemployment+rate#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:S&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:US&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en), and I will be looking at unemployment numbers starting from when President Jimmy Carter took office in 1977, and ending with today's rate. 

The figure will include when the President took office, when they left, the unemployment rates at both dates, and the net change in the rate over the course of their office.

* President Jimmy Carter took office in January 1977. Unemployment was at **7.5%**. When he left office in January of 1981, unemployment was at **7.5%** Net change: **+/- 0.0%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 4/4.**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 0/0**

**Number of years with House/Senate: 0/6**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 8/2**

* President Ronald Reagan's second term began in January of 1985. Unemployment was at **7.3%**. When he left office in January of 1989, unemployment was at **5.4%**. Net change: **-1.9%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 0/6**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 8/2**

* President George H. W. Bush took office in January of 1989, unemployment was at **5.4%**. When he left office in January of 1993, unemployment was at **7.3%**. Net change: **+1.7%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 0/0**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 4/4**

* President Bill Clinton took office in January of 1993, unemployment was at **7.3%**. When his first term was completed in January of 2001, unemployment was at **5.3%** Net change: **-2.0%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 2/2**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 6/6**

* President Bill Clinton's second term began in January of 1997. Unemployment was at **5.3%**. When he left office in January of 2001, unemployment was at **4.2%**. Net change: **-0.9%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 2/2**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 6/6**

* President George W. Bush took office in January of 2001, unemployment was at **4.2%**. When he completed his first term in January of 2005, unemployment was at **5.3%**. Net change: **+1.1%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 6/4**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 2/4**

* President George W. Bush's second term began in January of 2005. Unemployment was at **5.3%**. When he left office in January of 2009, unemployment was at **7.8%**. Net change: **+2.5%**
**Number of years with House/Senate: 6/4**
**Number of years with House/Senate opposed: 2/4**

* President Barack Obama took office in January of 2009, unemployment was at **7.8%**. Currently, unemployment is at **8.3%**. Net change: **+0.5%**.
**Number of years with House/Senate: 2/3**
**Number of Years with House/Senate opposed: 1/0**

Take these facts as you will, but let's remind ourselves that when discussing politics, as American citizens we tend to have terrible short-term memory. Before we make a partisan attack, let's make sure that we have the grounds to back it up.

EDIT: Thanks to comment suggestions, I will be revising this some time tonight to separate each period by terms(meaning splitting up the two-termers) and adding in the general trend of unemployment as it appeared to be heading at the time, based on a 6 month window. Finally, in the third update, I will add what party controlled the House and the Senate at the time of each Presidency.

EDIT 2: I have completed the separation of data based on Presidential terms. The next update will add the unemployment TREND that each President inherited. The trend will be based on what direction unemployment was moving for the first SIX MONTHS of a Presidency. If unemployment stayed within 0.5% in either direction, I will say that the trend was nominal. If it rose or fell 1.0%, I will say the trend was moderate. If it rose or fell over 1.5%, I will say that the trend was sharp.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,The unemployment rate: fact checking our Presidents.,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/pjjjg/the_unemployment_rate_fact_checking_our_presidents/,1324338802.0,t2_6h24a,1.0,2010

It goes like this:

Individuals are not free to marry any other individual of the opposite sex, that individual must be a willing partner. Marriage is a joint contract and thus the right to marry is bestowed not on an individual but on a willing couple.  

It is because of that fact, that we cannot then say that a gay man is free to marry a woman, and therefor his right to marry is equal to that of a straight man. He as an individual has no righto marry. No individual has a right to marry, so there rights are already equal in that they have no right to marry.

Marriage is a right reserved for couples, and thus we can only look at the rights of couples when we determine if any violation of the equal protection clause is occurring. 

In most states, a gay couple is denied the right to marry while a straight couple is not. That denial is bases solely on the combined sexes of the couple sand thus it is a violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution. 

If one argues that there are no constitutional protections for groups of individuals, then one must argue that a state could pass a law making it illegal for two Jews to form a business partnership, or for a white person and a black person to form a business partnership.

While the Republicans are tearing each other to pieces, the Obama campaign is funding a $1 billion dollar campaign, the Democrats are laying infrastructure all over the country (I think it was something like 10 offices in Ohio with a plan to have one in each of the 88 counties before the end of March) and preparing to retain the Senate, not to mention a major and well-funded attempt to take back the House.

I'm a political science major at Emory University, and I've been studying previous election cycles this semester. From what I've seen, this appears literally like a fracturing of their party. My question for anyone who has more knowledge than me is, are the Republicans fracturing? Are they going through an ideological shift?

I'm sure one common response will be that this is the way that the Constitution was written.  That's true, but the Constitution was written 100 years before the industrial revolution made cities the backbone of our country's economy.  It was written in a time when states behaved more like countries than as parts of a country.

It is simply inexcusable that we aren't doing some of the common-sense things that would make our cities, and consequently, our economy better.  How about we upgrade our airports?  How about we build a real high-speed train from Boston to DC?  

The answer is because we have one house of Congress that apportions representatives equally between rural and urban areas (the House), and one that is extremely skewed to the rural side (the Senate).  This makes no sense in a country where [82% of the population lives in urban or suburban areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States).  If our cities had representation in Congress that reflected 1) their value to our country, and 2) the size of their populations, these projects would already be done.

I propose that the Constitution be amended to give every urban area in the country with a population larger than the smallest state in the US one senator, and any city with a population greater than the median state population two senators.  Additionally, I believe the electoral college also contributes to this problem and should be replaced with a national popular vote.

The other criticism I anticipate says that this is simply a cynical ploy to marginalize conservatives and empower liberals.  I willingly concede the fact that that would happen if my ideas were implemented, and I would welcome that change.  However, the imbalance between rural and urban political power in the US would be just as unfair if urban areas were filled with religious nutjobs mindlessly advocating supply-side economics as if it were the Sermon on the Mount, and rural areas were sparsely populated with homosexual atheist farmers.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,Agree or Disagree: The Structure of the US Federal Government Favors Rural Interests Over Urban Interests,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/peevz/agree_or_disagree_the_structure_of_the_us_federal/,1325641023.0,t2_6ksao,,2010

These people are the only ones who reap the benefits of it, because they're the ones who own it all.

	What happens then? The people who own the means of production continue to produce and sell to the others who own means of production. But what of the people that aren't needed to produce? What happens to the people that don't own a means of production, that aren't inherently entertaining, that we can still support without taxing our production capacity?

	I don't have an answer to this. I doubt this is an original thought, or even a thorough one, but it's been a recurring idea in my head for a while now.

Now it has come up again in business law. Most people disagree with me, but no one ever gives a satisfying explanation as to why. 
Basically the issue came from the question ""Should suicide be illegal?"". As far as I can remember, everyone I know has said that it should. I agree that suicide is terrible, and should be prevented whenever possible, but the question still brought up a few contradictions. It seems to me that outlawing suicide negates the right to life by turning it into a requirement. 
Does the right to X imply the right to not X? Can one simultaneously be guaranteed a right and denied the right to not express the same right? If you were guaranteed the right to work, but denied the right to not work, we would not call that a right. We refer to that as slavery or forced labor. If you have the right to free speech, but not the right to not speak, then you are not free to say anything, but rather required to say something. So it seems to me that if you cannot choose to end your life, then you cannot choose to continue your life. 
This argument gets more supporters if we are talking about terminally ill people, but loses almost all support if we extend it to anyone. The argument usually becomes that if they want to kill themselves, then they have a psychological disorder and are incapable of making such decisions. But what if the patient shows no other outward signs of mental illness. They are smart, happy, balanced, and intelligent, but they want to die. They would still be labeled mentally incapable of making that decision, but on what grounds? The logic is circular. He cannot choose suicide, because he is mentally ill. He is mentally ill because he wants suicide. 
Take, for instance, the case of Armin Meiwes and Bernd Jürgen Brandes. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes
Now lets assume that Bernd Jürgen Brandes is a happy, competent, well adjusted individual. He is probably not, but for argument's sake lets assume he is. He has lived a good life and feels incredibly content with all that he has accomplished. The only thing he wants to do now is the ridiculous, yet consensual, act described in the link. 
We could argue that the man was clearly unstable, but we fall into that circular argument again. He cannot consent to X because he is Y. He is clearly Y because he wants to consent to X. This was the logic that caused Meiwes to be convicted of manslaughter. 
I think that a parallel argument might be an evangelical who believes gay sex to be an unforgivable sin saying ""He cannot consent to gay sex because he is clearly possessed. He is clearly possessed because he wants to have gay sex."" To those of us who would say that homosexuality is not a disorder (most of us), this argument is ridiculous.

""Congress only works three days a week. Did you know that?"" No I did not. ""Well it's true. They work three days and they can't do anything right. They should be required to work a full week like everyone else. How can they not get a budget passed when they have a full year to decide? New Hampshire gets it done and they only meet every couple years. It's saddening really. We need to get back to the glory days of America where politics wasn't a career, it was a passion. Back when I was young, many of the politicians were farmers who wanted what was best for everyone. Everyone is so greedy nowadays.""

""I disagree wholeheartedly with Tim Thomas's (Bruin's goalie) decision to make a political statement by not going to the White House to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup. That's what's wrong with this country. You respect your damn president whether he's a Democrat or a Republican. What he's saying is that he does not support the country he lives in unless the leader is from the Tea Party. That's just ridiculous. If he were here right now, I would have some choice words to set that young man straight.""

""America is getting soft."" What do you mean? ""Well, you're not allowed to discipline anymore. When I joined the Army, there was this lieutenant in basic training that everyone hated. He was the meanest S.O.B. I ever did meet. On the last day of training he told us, 'I know many of you hate my guts right now and rightfully so. But what I have done for you will help you in combat someday. If just one of you survives because of what I have taught you, I have done my job well.' That changed me. I am forever grateful for that man and everything he did for me. Now, you can't say one thing to a kid without being insensitive. I hope this doesn't become our greatest flaw.""

""We need to learn to agree. In my day, politicians from both sides of the table were able to get together, work through their differences, and sign a bill. Today, the party system is so fundamentally flawed.""

(Most of my family is Republican except me, Bob, and my dad) ""It's not Obama's fault. It's Congress' fault. They can't do anything at all."" Like the Do-Nothing Congress for Truman. ""Exactly!""

Problem is in a long time now every time we try to make a stand for our rights, we're only postponing the inevitable...
You cant win a war only by defending, you need to defeat your opponent, which we currently can not do.
It is because we are not united behind a single cause. Uniting to support ACTA, SOPA and PIPA is uniting in defence, but even if the acts aren't passed, its only a matter of time before some brainiac comes up with a workaround plan of how to censure the internet.
Censorship is the ultimate goal here. Its not copyright protection, its not fighting the piracy, its all about limiting information and making people uneducated and uninformed... people like that are easier to control.

So how do we fight it? Standing united against taking-away-our-rights wont do anymore, we need to take away power from people, corporations, organization or anyone who is behind these acts, anyone who benefits from them. We need to attack them and we need to hit them where it hurts the most - THE MONEY.

I'm going to explain a simple plan here, one that can work only if whole world supports it and one ""they"" will FEAR IMMENSELY if we show them there is even a remote chance of it getting big support from people around the world.


I'm calling it **the 10% PLAN**


The idea is that we limit profits of companies on a global scale to 10%
To put it simply, imagine a company that sells its product or services for 200$ (per unit).
Lets say sum of companies expenses for making this product (resources, maintenance of machines, salaries of workers, advertising the product and so on) is 100$ (per unit).
So company is making 100% profit for making this product.
Now, if we limit their profit to 10%, they're still be making profit, just not as much. It might look like a big limit to you now, but notice the biggest companies in the world, like ones supporting ACTA, SOPA and PIPA are making billions of dollars a year. Limiting they're income will still make them insanely rich, but not rich as they are now.

So what happens with profit they make over 10%? They are given a choice - give everything to the government **OR** invest it - in advertising, building new factories, opening new offices, creating more jobs, increasing quality of your products and services or simply paying your workers more. Many companies who make outrageous amounts of cash run to third world countries and exploit people there to work for lower wages because they make more profit that way. Perhaps this would fix all those problems.

Important thing is that no corporation wants this to happen, just as we don't want ACTA or SOPA.
We need to hit them where it hurts the most, show them we can make ridiculous demands too.
We might not have money, lawyers, politicians and bureaucrats at our disposals like they do, but we do have a difference source of power, something that they would like to, but do not control - THE INTERNET

I'm asking you to support this by spreading it as much as you possible. I'm hoping its something that might scare people behind ACTA and SOPA as much as they scared us.

I really don't care so much who won or not. From the get go, the media was predicting Ron would come in 2nd because of his previous election. I just don't understand how this type of huge disparity could be possible and yet keep the candidate from closing the gap with a main candidate.

But the opportunity for such transformations have been largely squandered. Fortunately, the opportunity for gaining real insight from all this has not yet been lost. 

The political stage is full of life and energy now. The economic problems are the burning issues in every debate. Every candidate seems to have a solution for the monetary problems we all face today. However, the ones who truly understand the turmoil the world is in, realize that the solutions offered are not cure, but just a balm to alleviate and forestall the problem before it raises its head again. 

*What do you think is the apt thing to do reddit ? Do we go back to laissez-faire style capitalism, gold-standard and totally minimize government, as Ron Paul suggests ? Do we socialize ourselves further following the lead of the nations of western europe, as Obama wishes to ? Do we do something else altogether ?*

I for one think that we ought to do the following:

1. Educate the young, emphasizing the value and importance of the learning history, math, economics and financial studies, ethics and morality. 


2. Make finance accountable; Establish a transparent system wherein the financial regulatory bodies of a country show how much of the money they manage, is put into aiding production and distribution of the goods and services and promoting real trade, which would benefit the economy of that country.


3. Take control of the finance of the country - Depreciate and make obsolete the Fractional Reserve System and Central Banking System and transfer the power of regulating the currency of a nation back to the nation's treasury.



Of course, these proposals are easier said than done. 


Earlier today, I had watched a video entitled ""[Money Masters : History of federal reserve](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7757684583209015812)"". 


Even though the video was clearly made sometime in the 1980s, I found it to be quite informative. It gave me a comprehensive historical perspective of the evolution and transformation of the global society to its present, lamentable condition. One thing that really liked about the video was the fact that instead of simply putting forth the problem, the makers of the video went on to propose their own solutions for solving the economic problems of their time(the inflation and price rise of the early 1980s). Another thing that I was impressed with was that it isn't the type of video that incites hate against people (bankers), as some ""conspiracy theory"" videos do, nor does this video leave you feeling helpless and depressed. This video condemns the current system in place, instead of the people who have brought in and established the current system. I urge you to watch the narration. Even though its a video of the 1980s, it truly bears relevance even today.

Concerts, exhibits, shopping, the heart of downtown Indianapolis transformed into what is known as the Super Bowl Village. Average ticket prices for the main event are in the $3,300 range. Hotel prices have soared some 1700%. It’s expected the Super Bowl will bring $150 million in revenue to the city. It’s the most popular sporting event in America. So who new the NFL’s $10 billion business was such an anti-American entity? According to the NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, the league “combines socialism and capitalism.” In fact, the NFL has come out strongly against Indiana’s anti-union law that made it the 23rd state to be a so-called “right-to-work” state. So what gives?

The NFL has understood for some time that ensuring competiveness, establishing rules for a fair game, adds up to greater fan participation and higher revenues. The more teams that actually have a chance of making it to the play-offs, and ultimately the Super Bowl, benefits all parties. In part this is through salary caps and revenue sharing among the 32 teams; ideas such as regulating the draft process so that the worst teams have first pick; and technologies like instant replay. With all of this socialism, it is still the most viewed, most merchandised, most popular sports league in America. What might we take away from the NFL’s business model?

For starters, the idea of “free-market” capitalism is crap. We have always tinkered with the economy, whether it was to promote free public education, support farming industries, give tax breaks to so-called job creators, or to pay for a military that can guarantee access to cheap resources. Some tinkering is good. Some tinkering is bad. The NFL has figured out what makes good tinkering, and we might take a lesson from that. We seem to be adverse to the idea of equitable opportunities, ensuring everyone in America has access to a level playing field and the opportunity to make it to the Super Bowl. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said he is not concerned with the poor as we have a safety net for them, that he is concerned with the 90-95% of Americans who are middle class. Let’s get something straight. Nearly 46 million Americans live in poverty. Combined, nearly 50% of Americans are in poverty or considered low-income. Anyone in this situation knows the difficulty in actually making a better life for themselves or their families. To be blunt, the system has been rigged and stacked against them. For 30 years the system has favored few at the expense of many. Ensuring competitiveness and fairness has been replaced with the idea of safety nets. There is a reason the current generation of parents fear their children will grow-up worse-off than they are.

So what needs to happen? Don’t let the boogey man scare us into the idea that a little bit of socialism tossed with capitalism will destroy us. What is destroying us is a system that is tinkered with by wealthy individuals and corporations, stacking a system in their favor, leaving a large majority of Americans choking on their greed.

My understanding of these financial devices is that they are used by institutions that have long lifetimes to ensure the security of those institutions.  Those institutions use the interest off the endowment, but not the principle amount, to add to their other sources of funding.  My question is: why haven't various levels of government done something similar at any point in the past?

Obviously, in a time like now where budgets are almost universally in shortfalls it would be nearly impossible to set up an endowment.  And while I'm sure that most years in the past most budgets have been carved out to the last penny or beyond, there must have been some years where some money could have been put away for such a purpose.

I think such a financial device could encourage or at least make available a number of interesting policy mechanisms.  For example, perhaps any fine paid to a particular government would be paid into the endowment (or at least partially into the endowment) instead of directly into the annual budget.  Perhaps if there were a budget surplus, there would be another option besides a tax rebate or an additional spending project.

But I just realized that I have no clue what the heck the Federal Reserve is. Can you guys answer some questions?

From what I understand, it is the organization that sets interest rates and prints money in the US. It is run by representatives from Federal Open Market Committee, 7 which are the Board of Governors appointed by the PotUS, and 5 of which are representatives from regional Federal Reserve Banks.

So my questions are:

1. What interest rates are they adjusting? The interest rates on loans? Or the interest rates of treasury bonds? Both?

2. How does adjusting interest rates affect the economy? If interest rates are increased, for example, is that good or bad?

3. What are Federal Reserve Banks? Are they actual banks you can deposit money in and takes loans out? What's the difference between a Federal Reserve bank and a private bank like Bank of America, for example?

4. How big of an affect do private banks like Bank of America have on the Federal Reserve?

5. Do decisions made by the Federal Reserve go through Congress?

6. For what reasons does the Federal Reserve decide to print money?

7. Why does the Federal Reserve print money, and not the Treasury?

8. Why are some Republican candidates against the Fed?

edit: Thanks for the discussion, guys. Everything is clearer to me. From what I understand:

1. The Fed adjusts the interest rates of inter-bank loaning. These are loans that the banks make to satisfy withdrawals and reserve requirements.

2. Increasing interest rates means banks are less likely to ask for loans. They'll sit on more money, meaning the money supply shrinks and inflation decreases.

3. Federal Reserve banks store physical money for both the government and banks. They are the ones who supply the money backed by FDIC. Private banks can be member or non-member banks. Member banks are backed by FDIC. Most non-member banks are credit unions.

4. Private banks have no effect on the Federal Reserve. They are just subject to the policies made by the Federal Reserve.

5. Decisions made by the Fed are not sent to Congress. The Fed only controls the money supply such that economic growth can be stimulated.

6. The Federal Reserve prints enough money to ensure there is enough physical money in circulation. Most money created by the Fed, however, is not through physical printing, but by creating more debt by adjusting the fraction in fractional reserve banking.

7. The Treasury does the minting of the money, but only at the discretion of the Fed. The Fed is in control of the money supply for the sole purpose of stimulating the economy. 

8. Some candidates are against the Fed because it can create money at will. This leads to inflation. However, some people have pointed out that some inflation is good for the economy. Also, the FDIC -- along with government intervention through things like stimulus bills and TARP -- is enough to ensure hyperinflation and depressions won't occur.

Simple comedy, buzz words, dirty jokes, funny photos…  Photos of candidates eating corn dogs?  SO HILARIOUS!  We’ve really proven ourselves to be proles in the stinkard pit.

2. It’s easy to care about something that doesn’t matter; it’s a distraction from more important issues.  God forbid we try to follow what’s going on with the U.S. sanctions on Iran, the current state of the European Union, the massacre is Syria… should I go on?

3. It’s an issue for lazy people, in other words: voting tends to be for lazy, ignorant people.

4. Or maybe we all don’t know that it is bullshit despite the obvious bullshit and most of us somehow remain unbelievably ignorant.

It’s ridiculous when I see the most intelligent of people focusing on the upcoming elections.  It’s like nobody has ever read anything about propaganda, media tactics, writings by Noam Chomsky, or *1984*.  If we know anything from history, it’s that systems use the media and public relations to keep citizens docile, misinformed, focused on less important issues, and well, stupid.

If we just divert our attention away from the election, essentially ignore it and make it irrelevant, then it will be irrelevant!  We have the power to make changes in this country; the changes that we want.  Yes: you, me and everyone you know has the power to do something about the discontent in this world that does not have to do with these elections.  By focusing on the election, we are holding ourselves back.  We do not need to participate in the upcoming elections to change this country.

Although we as americans like to look at ourselves as though we are the peacekeepers and enforcerers of justice in the world, this is not the case. we are a capitalist democracy, and because of the capitalist aspect we have a business sector, that does whatever it can to make a profit. Apple has been doing business practices that are unethical and because of this, should not have there products bought.

We also live in a democracy, where the people are able to actively influence our governemt by taking a stand. by taking these stands, and building unions in the past, through very difficult struggle over cheap labor and poor working conditions americans had allowed workers rights to flourish giving employee's such things as the equal oppurtunity act, minimum wage, the right to choose to have a representative fight for you to get a raise, and to force the employer to have good reason to fire an employee. Lets then use our democracy to fight for the workers in China who do all they can to oppress the creation of unions making it impossible for them to fight for themselves. We have the ability to boycott business when they are unethical. The civil rights movement was started with a boycott of city busses, causing busses to change there business practices and eventually ending legal segregation. The unethical business practices of apple can be fought just as effectively with a boycott because of the very same reason they are able to thrive. the demand.

If the  Chinese workers are forced to attempt to take a stand against there governement they would meet fierce resistance from there government, possibly becoming violent, because an oppressed group can only stay oppressed for so long.  

As consumers we should not buy products that are made by workers that are forced those to make the product to live and work in squalor in order to provide a means to survive. 

If we were to boycott the most bought consumer item in our economy, this is the possible effect. The Demand for Ipods goes down, but the conditions of workers do not change, they will be working to create a supply that meets the same demand. this means the workers will be overworked without it being justified by there government since we wont be lining up for the next new model of the ""better"" product. If the demand goes down, and the workers conditions do not change, apple will have to change there business practices. Either keep allowing there sales to drop because of the peoples awareness of the inhumaity of there actions, or bring jobs back to the us and have us make the products, truely being Job creators, playing by the rules we have here. Ipods are one of the most bought consumer products we have, think what would happen to our economy if we were also the country that made them. 

as long as apple continue the unethical and inhumane business pracitice of cheap labor, every ipod that is bought justifies how they are made, and that would mean even knowing that cheap labor is opressing workers, you would still buy it because of how good the product is, and if that is the case, would you want the product if thats what hell you had to go through to make it?.



Amended: I must include that this is not exclusive to Apple, in fact Apple has done much in order to stop cheap labor practices in China, but as long as they continue to do these practices they are still in the wrong. This boycott should be to any New consumer product that uses cheap labor in order to make that product, on the grounds that using such a labor force as inhumane as slavery, for the people doing this labor do so forced by desperation or fear, and are not paid a wage that allows them to live freely in the same place they work",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,I think we should boycott Ipods/Iphones because of the poor working conditions it promotes with every ipod that is sold.,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/q0oaq/i_think_we_should_boycott_ipodsiphones_because_of/,1326936777.0,t2_6p16k,1.0,2010

I realize that freedom of speech doesn't always mean the same thing everywhere, but some of this should be illegal anywhere (particularly the discrimination on Muslims).

They have [targeted tens of thousands of gypsies for deportation](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2013917,00.html).

They also have historically refused to allow peaceful decolonization of any of its territories like [Madagascar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_revolt), Morocco, [Algeria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War_of_Independence), [Tunisia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizerte_crisis), and of course the [French Indochina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War).

I support every encampment I support every protest and every march and I believe in occupy as much as the next devout occupier. 
My issues are this. 
In my mind occupy is such a simple movement, we have a simple message. Stop the fucking bullshit. 

Whether it be money in politics, Corporate control of the media, Corporate control of the government, Corporations writing the words our government puts into law, and also as a generality money in politics. They are all intertwined and you can see these things in many different ways but clearly as everyone who occupies can see, It's bullshit.

So now that we have these clear concise almost universal goals lets see what occupy has done with them. 
With this very apparent knowledge at least to us, we created quite a small following. word spread fast and to those who were internet savy or just big into movements and such we got the info quick and we said wow these people are right on, Protesting right at the source wall st hence the original naming of occupy and also a big reason support was raised quite quickly and donations were coming in quite fast.

Now at this point with momentum, with public interest, and with the money to create awareness. The movement halted, and this is where I think we really dropped the ball. The money was squandered. Now I don't know where all the money went but I do know. Most was stolen, misused, used for laptops, iphones, houses, and many other silly things that DID NOT further the movement. 

Occupy also decided to be leaderless which in 2012 is an actual possibility, but instead of taking that in the right direction. We chose to have ""Leaderless Leaders"" The people who were using the money, stealing the money, manipulating these people at their local occupies and not using it to further the movement. Right now and since the movement has started the number 1 thing needs to be spreading the word garnering support. Not propositions for laws not delegates or people we want to see get elected at a local level or even senators WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT WE HAVE NO NUMBERS AND PUBLIC IS AGAINST US. The people who are asking for the ways to fix things and want propositions and clear things we want done ARE THE WRONG PEOPLE TO BE BENDING TO. 

We have a message that millions want to hear and they don't even know it. they think the opposite

 Not only this but as the leaders of occupy, they were not doing what leaders are supposed to. they were not spreading the word they were not furthering the movement in a productive way. Point blank every cent of that money should of went to raising awareness of what occupy is about, WHY we are occupying and why YOU the disenfranchised 99%er need to come join us. In this sense occupy has already beyond failed. 

Not even 80% of America has any real idea of what occupy is about.

We can accomplish nothing with current numbers or even another 10,000 people UNLESS WE START RECRUITING AND SPREADING THE WORD to town halls to city councils to the people who get all their info from FOX,CNN,MSNBC AND CORPORATE MEDIA those are the people who support us and those are the people we need. Our support lies in rural America and we HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HELLO TO THESE PPL

 We did not spread the word. We did not put out national TV ads. We didn't send those ""leaders"" out TO PREACH the truth of occupy to rally hundreds of thousands of people to the cause. And the fact IS simply THIS. if you believe we are the 99% which I do. why did you not go and open their motherfucking eyes. Instead you allowed them to be TOLD what occupy is. TOLD who occupy is. 

Now, because of that public opinion is Occupy=Woodstock 2. We allowed media to control the 99% and tell them what occupy is and this cannot change unless we proactively GO RECRUIT and SPREAD THE MESSAGE. We are being slammed and lied about every time the media speaks of us and if we allow it to continue if we allow things like MAY DAY: GENERAL STRIKE to happen we may not be able to get that support ever again.

I seem to be saying a lot so ill consolidate some points until this gets any attention if it even does.

We are not even 1% as of now. as a matter of fact media is turning us into the 1% they are making drug dealers homeless and criminals flock to occupies... that's exactly what happened in wallst and its whats happening everywhere and its what they want.
 
We have no numbers.
 
We have no support.
 
We now have no money. 

And yet NOW after allll this! We are proposing a GENERAL STRIKE.... This is the epitome of stupidity and ignorance and I can only imagine this is sabotage from within. If we allow may day to happen it will destroy the movement and bring us to a point of no return with the public. 

We have no support NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT and the MEDIA will DEVOUR US WITH THIS they will completelyyy annihilate us with this and the sheep(99%) that have been listening will believe even deeper we are hippys who smoke pot and don't want to work. 
THEY WILL NAIL THE COFFIN SHUT AND I CAN TELL YOU MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE ARE IN THE GROUND RIGHT NOW. this will completely alienate occupy we cannot have a general strike WITH NO NUMBER AND NO SUPPORT.  well that's my 2 cents I would love to have some discussion. O AND WE LOVE THE INTERNET THAT CAN SPREAD THE MOVEMENT THAN WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLIES OR MEETINGS OR AT LEASTTTT AN OPEN FORUM ON OCCUPY POLICY AND ACTIONS EVERY MONTH. 

I would love to discuss more so pm me please or write a comment

love to all:)

I'm asking either for you personally, in general, or both. Likewise, the scope of what this applies to is open as well: it could be for elections, legislation, or just in general. All I ask is that you specify early on what your scope is.

Regarding definitions: cultural/social refers to things like gay marriage, euthanasia, marijuana legalization, birth control, etc., and generally things that don't have to do with the distribution of material wealth or resources. Political/economic is basically then everything else, like welfare, taxes, judiciary and legal issues, exercises of military power, civil rights (there might be some overlap here with cultural/social depending on if it affects resource distribution), policies and procedures, and international relations.

Originally, the title was going to be ""which is more important,"" but I decided with ""takes precedent"" since it connotes priority varying with time and circumstance more than absolute, inherent superiority.

Edit:

Here's an example of the difference between cultural/social and political/economic:

If you want to talk about **the banning of birth control for moral reasons**, then it would fall under cultural/social. If you wanted to talk about **subsidizing or giving away birth control for free**, then it would be political/economic. Also note that **the banning of birth control of economic reasons** would (obviously) fall under political/economic, but it would be a stretch to make **subsidizing or giving away birth control for free for moral reasons** a cultural/social issue since it inherently is an issue of distributing resources.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,Which takes more precedence and why: cultural/social issues or political/economic issues?,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/pxnwd/which_takes_more_precedence_and_why/,1299025190.0,t2_4wpy9,,2010

Pakistan has got separate status of independent country from India that they will live peacefully and progress tremendously with his neighbor India but that could not happen.  

Though, India has progressed manifolds in its economy and raising standard of common Indian despite ""population bomb and countering terrorism"", the condition of common men in our neighbour Pakistan  has not improved considerably after partition due to their government wrong policies and supporting terrorism.

Both neighbours had to fought 4 war since 1947 for gain of nothing except escalation of hatred themselves. In past, many times,  both countries tried to come closer but hard cores and fundamentalists always did awkward terrorism work in India territory that spoiled the relation between them again and again.

In order to give boost to India-Pak relationship, India granted MFN (Most Favoured nation) but it is unfortunate that it took 15 years to Pakistan to merely agree principally to grant India MFN status reciprocally, but till date has not been granted in reverse interest of citizens of Pakistan.

Mary McAleese while quoting about neighbour  said: “That past is still within our living memory, a time when neighbour helped neighbour, sharing what little they had out of necessity, as well as decency”.

Presently, a trade fare is being organised in Lahore which is drawing huge crowd in Pakistan  but could not be of any help to Indian industry unless MFN status is not granted to India for free and fair trade.

Commerce Minister Amin Fahim and his Indian counterpart Anand Sharma witnessed the signing ceremony of the agreements, which would ensure confidence-building of the business community on both sides of the border and enable the two countries to address the issues related to non-tariff barriers systematically.


Citizens of both countries failed to understand that why the government of Pakistan bow before the fundamentalists in improving relationship with his neighbour-India which can not only prove lucrative to the citizens of Pakistan but also boost the doldrums economy of Pakistan by saving billions of dollars.

If it is not foolish than even not wise step also that why Pakistan purchases Suzuki Alto cars or others goods in double price from Japan when he can easily purchase the cars from its neighbour in half price.  India is now hub for exporting the medicine to USA and China but Pakistan is paying seven times prices to USA for purchasing medicine which they can comfortably import from India by road route which is hardly half an hour journey from Amritsar to Lahore.

Similarly, the Pakistan is short of sugar and tea while India is abundant in both, even than Pakistan is shying and reluctant to buy from India at cheaper price. At present, Pakistan imports only 1,963 items from India against about 9,000 items that it imports from other nations. Why Pakistan is wasting its meager foreign exchange and cursing its citizen with high priced goods is not understandable.

If the proposal gets approved, and the MFN status is granted to India by Pakistan Government, at the most  about 350 items will be barred from being imported into Pakistan from India. Currently, only 2,000 items are allowed to be imported into Pakistan. So, around 45,00 items will be free for export from India to Pakistan after MFN status been granted.

Presently, India-Pakistan  formal bilateral trade is currently a nearly $3 billion;   which could have been turned into 14 billion dollars in year to come after the granting of the status of MFN to India. This will not only boost India trade to its neighbour but also reduce the burden on meagre foreign exchange reserve of Pakistan which merely depends upon USA aid and IMF or Asian Bank. The sore relationship between America and Pakistan in the issue of supporting terrorist in Pakistan territory has already  compelled USA government to cut aid to Pakistan.

The Pakistan foreign reserve has already come down to nearly ""US$12.50 billion"". Already, the USA in an revenge to Pakistan has cut further $700 million in aid  to punish the country for allowing radicals to smuggle material used to make improvised explosive devices through its territory and into Afghanistan. In the past, the United States has allocated about $20 billion in security and economic aid to Pakistan since 2001, much of it as reimbursements for assistance in fighting terrorists.

According to one estimate, India and Pakistan together stand to save a minimum of 55 percent of their import bills on about 200 product categories, reducing the consumption expenditure in both countries by more than $800 million per year, than why Pakistan is shying to grant MFN status to India.

Pakistan is in old habit  to work in reverse gear to cripple its economy and crush its population with inflation and to provide high priced goods in total reverse to the world trend where whole world is looking for cheaper goods to cut down the high prices and save its foreign reserves.

We certainly have interests that conflict with Iran's policies, but, as evidenced by the ""WMD"" pretense of 2003, we are already contemplating war with a country long before it poses a real threat. There are justifications that must be present before we actually attack, but what is it that makes a small, subconscious part of me feel, even as a harmlessly patriotic American, that war with Iran tomorrow would be a good thing—*a just thing?* The average American, in a rural agricultural community in the Midwest, or in suburban Massachusetts, has no personal stake in such affairs which, to the politically aware and involved, have value in being in the interests of international security. Why would a seventeen-year-old boy from a middle-class family in a small city, an intelligent kid with a promising future, who is far from ignorant of foreign lands and cultures, a true humanist with no sense of religious duty, have *any* compulsion to risk it all for a political war, for lethal realism? All democratic countries and peoples are willing to fight and die for freedom, but the power of the United States since World War II has brought it into the sphere of all international affairs; our patriotism accompanies us where it often shouldn't. We have been looking for a new ""King of Britain"" since the Revolution, a tyrant to overthrow, a people to liberate, but this fundamental belief does not include international revolution akin to that of Marxism. Rather, our country has become involved internationally with the ability to intervene in and often initiate conflicts abroad. This revolutionary pretext is a justification which lies at in the heart of the people of this country, ready to be invoked by political events both bad and good. It got us into World War II with a fiery motivation to fight for freedom far from US soil, but it also can be manipulated politically to target other governments deemed tyrannical. I would have been proud to help liberate France from Nazi occupation during WWII and bring democracy to the Axis powers, but that was a war started by a tyrant to defeat the democracies of Europe, not a war started by a democracy to defeat a tyrant. Only in defense of freedom would I see such a war as just—never as an offensive, never provoked. That shall be left to the people.

Patriotism is a part of human nature that will remain with us always, but in this modern era it must be checked by reflection and intellectual analysis so as to ensure that it serves no man but man itself.

How Mixing Politics and Friendships Can Make for Awkward Table Talk

Picture it: You've got a tableful of tasty food and all of your family and friends are gathered around to share a holiday meal. Sounds like a lovely evening. ""Could you please pass the mashed potatoes?"" someone asks.

But when you check your smartphone after dessert, you realize that your childhood friend sitting next to you (who's smiling and acting like everything is peachy) just ""unfriended"" you on Facebook for making a nasty online comment about Newt Gingrich. The horror! It's like a scene from a soap opera.

The media is covering this topic like wildfire, and rightfully so. (Check out recent interviews I did on this very topic on WABC-TV Eyewitness News and amNew York). A recent poll by social media analytics company NM Incite suggests that 14% of Facebook users who unfriend someone do so because they've been offended by political comments that were posted on the site. What does this say about free speech? Is it only free if someone is willing to agree with you? Or is the price you pay for speaking freely the loss of friends?

Personally, I think it's all a balancing act. We become friends with people on Facebook because we want to connect with them, get regular updates on things happening in their lives and share our experiences with them. These are often the same reasons we become friends with people in real life. And we typically become friends with people who share our opinions, compliment things we do and enjoy doing the same things we do.

But that doesn't explain why so many Facebook users feel compelled to unfriend someone just because he or she expressed a particular political view. Can't they just avoid reading those status updates? Would they unfriend someone in real life who made a political comment they didn't like? And what does this say about the future of our relationships? There are more questions than answers, but in my opinion, rightly or wrongly, this is becoming the new norm. Social media has changed not only the way we share and receive information, but also the way we interact and the ways in which relationships function.

Here are some other interesting statistics from the NM Incite study regarding Facebook users' behavior:
• 82% of users make someone their Facebook friend because they know the person in real life

• 23% of users unfriend someone because the friend made depressing comments on the site

• 11% of users unfriend someone due to a breakup or divorce

• 3% of users unfriend someone for not updating their profile often enough

Looks like this dinner party is going to have some interesting conversation. Could you please pass the unsubscribe button with a side of unfriend?

When I was growing up, I had no problem reading.  That was, until I got into 8th grade.  In 8th grade, we read several high-level books including Frankenstein and The Grapes of Wrath.  What no one knew at the time was, I was dyslexic.  I also had attention difficulties; that it is to say, other people had difficulty getting me to pay attention to their boring shit.  So I could read -- and I read heavily to this day.  I just couldn’t read novels.  

The problem with a novel is that its long, and it uses flowery language -- “themes” and “metaphors”.  Teachers tell you about this flowery language with a sneer and disdain.  Obviously its your fault, 10 year old, that you cannot understand the postmodern literary messages in a 200 year old book to the extent that a college-educated 30 something can.  And if you are not as smart as the teacher, you get an F.  Its that simple.  There was no attempt at remedial action: either you understood these abstract concepts or you didn’t, full stop.  

As I got into high school, the books got hard, the assignments took all night, and if I actually did the reading it would have been the only thing I did.  Fortunately I skipped reading and focused on my computer hobby -- a much better use of my time.  By participating in class discussions and using context clues, I could sometimes pass tests- sometimes.  Sure I got Cs and Ds in a lot of English classes.  Its not like there was anything I could do about it.  Parents and teachers belligerently railed at me for being lazy and not paying attention, and I just learned to ignore them.

English literature started to sneak into history and religion classes (I went to Catholic school).  I probably could have done very well in these classes if I wasn’t forced to read.  Instead I got Cs and Ds.  The message was clear: your intelligence is not your ability to do math, use computers, or argue eloquently, its your ability to read the unclear language of old men who deliberately obscured their writing to make themselves sound smarter.  You are dumb if you can’t understand Shakespeare or Chaucer, who obviously wrote for the benefit of 14 year old 21st century Americans.  

Speaking of Shakespeare, there is a way to understand him and enjoy his writing.  Its called “Shakespeare Made Easy”.  Its wonderful -- on the right side of the page, the original text.  On the left side of the page, a modern interpretation.  In retrospect, I wish I had acquired companion readers for everything I was forced to read.  Why didn’t I?  Because somewhere along the line, some pissy teacher told me that that was cheating -- the single worst crime any student has ever committed.  

Of course, then you were required to write about what you read.  You were told to write what you thought, but got punished unless you wrote what the teacher wanted you to write.  Teachers spend a lot of time trying to break down the rules of writing, and punished you if you didn’t follow the rules.  But the rules changed with every teacher.  

Let me ask you this, how many sentences is a paragraph?  The actual answer is that it doesn’t matter -- one sentence or even a sentence fragment can be a valid paragraph.  However, teachers often assign homework as a number of paragraphs, and then punish you after the fact if your paragraphs were too short.  Of course, every teacher has a different number.  When I was in 3rd grade, then number was 3, then in 5th grade it was 5.  Somehow the number magically increased in those two years; I guess there was a major language shift.  

The number one reason why many adults do not write or create art is because of fear of criticism.  Its obvious why this happens: the only time Americans get to write or draw and share it with others is as children in classrooms.  The message when you get papers or drawings back is clear: “D+”.   AKA, you’re not good enough.

Of course, you can’t try to discuss your issues, because that's complaining and complaining means detention.  Now go back and stare blindly at these words you don’t understand.  It’s your fault for being too stupid to understand them.

 Every day I live in fear that the state government would jump at the chance to deny my citizinship, detain me indefinitely without trial, and potentially kill me for storing more than a weeks worth of food in my house. Just the same as I know without federal oversight of the internet, every page would be 100% child porn.

Let's just face it that all people are inherently evil, and without the guiding hand of the government, people would live corrupt and immoral lives selling themselves to the highest bidder. We need the Federal Government because it is made up of not of everyday people like you and me who have to be told the difference between right and wrong, but of the most impeccable, wise, and incorruptible people in our society. Without a behemoth of complicated regulations and laws designed with loop-holes, written in doublespeak in ways that challenge our knowledge of the English language, surely the state would crumbling into complete anarchy, corporate raiding, and acid rain would fall from the skies striking an economic blow to our winter tourist industry.

    You see the problem here with states rights is that the government body can be so easily changed and influenced by majority rule of it's constituents. The decisions it makes are easily accountable to the residents of that state. And that majority within the state itself it's comprised of all of us immoral heathens and pirate barons wishing only to reinstate slavery, spoil the land we personally own with pollution, and dismantle all support for public education (i personally abhor education) in order to turn a profit. And since state-level regulation of these things would be up to us, the general public, rather than the federal government which is run by the corporations that have only the well-being of the public in mind, we would easily be able to take control of our state and rape and pillage it like we all want. It's a good thing that our Constitution gave dominance in law to the Federal Government or else they would have to illegally impose their views on our evil little states when we disagreed with them.

One could argue that a hand full of third party candidates would hold a great(er) deal of power &amp;amp; influence if they captured a few seats in the House and Senate given how many seats are up for grabs and by how narrow a margin legislation gets passed/blocked.

Ditto if they ran for city/state legislature or mayor or govenorship.

I have seen plenty of third party candidates on the ballot, but never any that showed a significant level of organization or concerted effort behind them or that didn't just come off as batshit crazy.

I know as far as California is concerned marijuana dispensaries are allowed to sell marijuana, but are not allowed to profit off of it, as they are technically registered as non-profit charities. However, all marijuana sales are taxed at a fairly high rate. It isn't uncommon for dispensaries to pay more than a million dollars in taxes a year. In San Jose alone the marijuana tax there brings in an estimated 290,000$ a month from the tax, with figures projected to be much higher in other cities which aren't releasing the figures of just how much the marijuana tax is bringing in. 

So my question is whether or not it is legal for a state to make money off of a product which is illegal at a Federal level. The same businesses which pay the state millions of dollars a year are also subject to Federal raids which demonstrates that the activity they are engaged in is illegal at the Federal level. So why isn't the state also implicated in Federal raids as they are clearly profiting to the tune of millions of dollars off the sale of an illegal Schedule I drug which is in the same class as Heroin.

Let's get rid of birth control and abortion:

To be honest I could care less about the women's rights movement. Not that they shouldn't be treated fairly, just I have no vested interest. I do care that women go out and get pregnant and (a moment for digression: be a slut, who cares, you have sexual needs, I would fuck myself stupid if I had a vagina and the power of multiple orgasms) do not want the kid, hate the kid after the pregnancy, and the kid starts a life of crime because they have parent issues. Yes, abortions solved a lot of our crime problems. (fuck you if you think differently) Now, they want to get rid of the one way of stopping unwanted pregnancies. We are human, we fuck for fun, get over it you dick holes. 

Gay marriage should be stopped: Marriage shouldn't even be a fucking legal term. Gay, straight, poly... it doesn't matter. Religion should have no effect on my decisions. So as a society, we refer to 2 people that want to stay together for the rest of their lives a civil union. Let their religion tell them what to call it. Fuck marriage as a legal term, civil unions for all. If you are religious call it marriage if you want or bland sex game, it's your life.

Socialized medicine: Alright, I love the system we have. I have kick ass insurance and I fucking pay for it. But I have been to the doctor lately and they are endowed with fucking moron patients which degrades my care. It's called a cold, eat some chicken soup. I believe we should have a reverse pay system. If you have something wrong with you and you need help, we as a society pay for it. Regular check ups for PM, we pay for it. Got the the ER for the sniffles, that will cost you millions. Can't pay the fee, better be sure you have something fucking wrong with you before you go.  
Also, I have had shitty insurance. If I have knee pain after a trauma, I don't need to go to a GP, I need to go to a orthopedist. Not a giant mystery. (it's an example of problems I had, I had been seeing the same orthopedic surgeon for 10 years for the same problem, went to crappy insurance, had to go to a fucking GP for a referral??? are you fucking serious????)
There should be social medicine and then their should be private medicine. If I can afford the better care I should get it, if I can'
t maybe I get the doctor with the C average. 
(although I think the world could do with significantly less people, let's say 1/7 I'd be happy to choose)

War: You know the ones we have and the ones they want...
I think we we should be like a referee. As long as your fight doesn't leave your boarders... not our problem. We stick our noses in places it doesn't belong, guess what it's going to get punched. Obviously war can be used for good, but we have gone way too far. Look at who the bully is, it's us America. Grow up and take responsibility. 
On a side note: dear troops, I love you all and I thank you for serving our country. I thank you for doing as you have been asked and I hope you all the best. Return safely to the arms of your loved ones. We love you and we own you more than we can ever give. 

Science and education: fuck you, they are the same. You know the billions we throw away on stupid things, or the 700 billion + we spend on defense. (680 appropriated, but there is funding beyond that)
If you want to be the biggest, best, most powerful nation on the planet, you damn well better be the smartest. We should be pouring money into education and science. Guess where we can get more money... inventions and technology, and then we can buy more inventions and technology. If people were educated, you wouldn't have to explain to a grown woman how the fuck she got pregnant or that a gallon of milk that cost $3 is cheaper per unit than buying 2 quarts for $2. (actual problem I posed when I did substitute teaching to seniors in high school and they fucking got it wrong)

Open Primaries when only one party is voting are always interesting, but I find it far more interesting in Michigan. There's almost always talks of the opposite party voting for whoever they believe will cause the most chaos, but it rarely seems to have an effect. However, this specific race has a few unique elements. 

1. The polling between Romney and Santorum is so close that a handful of Democrats could be enough to tip the balance and win the state for Santorum.
2. Michigan has become such a big state in scope of this race, that a win for Santorum could start a landslide of support.
3. Santorum has proven to provide so many cringe worth quotes that Democrats will have to hold their noses to vote for him.

Ron Paul is the worst.  For example:  He's constantly talking about how, when he is elected President, he will do away with the Department of Education.  But in order to do that, he would need an act of Congress.  If he really is so adamant about this, wouldn't he be in a better position to do this as a sitting Congressman, and if so - why hasn't he done this already?

Alright, so the further back we go, the more my history sucks, but it seems that every time we mount a hill, we crank up the fear machines and try to undo the social transformation and progress gained in the previous valley. Right now, the world looks like it's slippy-sliding down a hill:



 -  Valley ~ 1835 - 1859 

  - Abolitionist movement
   
  - Suffrage movements

  - First wave of feminism (Seneca Falls Convention)

_____________

 - Hill ~ 1860 - 1882

  - Civil War 

  - Dawn of ""Gilded Age""

  - Wage slavery (according to NY Times and popular consensus)

  - Racism overload (Chinese, blacks, etc)

____________________


 - Valley ~ 1883 - 1908

  - Labor rights movement swells, gains ground

  - Socialist movement grows

________________

 - Hill ~ 1909 - 1932

  - WWI

  - First Red Scare

  - Birth of the Bernays-style propaganda (renamed to ""public relations"") and its advertising industry

  - Prohibition / opium criminalization / reefer madness

  - Massive strikebreaking / union busting

 - Valley ~ 1933 - 1966 

  - Glass–Steagall Act

  - New Deal

  - Bretton Woods system

  - Second wave of feminism

  - Peak of union membership 

  - Civil rights movement, end of de jure segregation and racial terrorism

  - Social safety net (social security, medicare, medicaid, etc)

________________________________

 - Hill ~ 1967 - now-ish

  - Vietnam (escalation)

  - Neoliberal era begins (corporate deregulation, liberation of capital, rebirth of horse-and-sparrow economics)

  - Bye-bye Bretton-Woods, Glass-Steagall, hello efficient market hypothesis (deindustrialization, growth of finance)

  - Words like ""conservative"" and ""libertarian"" take an Orwellian semantic shift toward synonyms for the above

  - Aggressive expansion of corporate (super?) personhood (NAFTA Ch. 11, Citizens United)

  - War on drugs (redux),  *unbelievably massive* expansion of the prison-industrial complex

  - Mainstream media corporations all consolidated to be countable on one hand

Another interesting thing is that most of the social, \**ahem*\*, 'instability' doesn't look like it precipitates or deepens the winter phases, but actually appears about the time that the ""oh shiiii-"" phase of it is tapering off. So it looks like the socially-driven market 'inefficiencies' (like workers demanding safety and a living wage and stuff) are not what makes the winter come. 

And of course, there's also the ominous observation that the last four 'springs' have been accompanied by enormous bloodbaths.

you think that times will be too hard if you boycott, but if you are at 25 miles to the gallon running at 90,000 miles+ then i bet you are in a bit of a situation urself. they will run your money dry and when you have nothing left to take they will shove you off like the dirt on their shoes. we are already entering a recession... only difference is that if gas is boycotted, then the rich will join in the pain

in the end, one could not ask to stop buying gas. it is need to get to and from work, but all other avenues are not needed. walking and bike riding will help those on diets and keep fit those that arent. the only other thing that would be tricky on a bike is grocery shopping so there is that... but if you were to boycott gas then use buses for all you entertainment needs, then invest in the bus company near you and while the oil companies lose millions you get richer.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,"Gas prices soaring, poor going broke, middle class going poor....",http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/q99q3/gas_prices_soaring_poor_going_broke_middle_class/,1320953935.0,t2_67xnw,,2010

Wouldn't this argument be airtight? Has anyone tried this in the courts?

First, some facts:

**1. The government got involved in regulating the religious institution of marriage.** In fact, you can be legally married without being married through a church. You can claim it on your taxes. Marriage is a legal status available to citizens that includes rights and protections specifically for spouses. 


**2. The Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees all citizens equal protection of the law.** Pretty self-explanatory.


**3. Brown v. Board of Education ruled that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.""** Giving one group a ""different"" set of privileges that are supposed to be the same as the other group's is inherently flawed and renders the minority group's privileges inherently unequal.


So, we have a government that regulates and grants the status of marriage to its citizens. We have an amendment to the Constitution stating that all citizens are guaranteed equal protection under the law, and we have a Supreme Court ruling that saying that separate but equal is inherently unequal.

Doesn't that mean that civil unions are a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment? How on earth is gay marriage not legal yet?

&gt;Islam is not a religion, nor is it a cult. In its fullest form, it is a complete, total, 100% system of life.  Islam has religious, legal, political, economic, social, and military components. The religious component is a beard for all of the other components.

The argument that the religion cannot exist without the other components is, on its face, false. The same can also be said of [Christianity in the middle ages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom#Late_Antiquity_and_Middle_Ages). And if the religious is a beard for the other components, then why is the argument leveled against the religion itself, rather than the politicized elements within it (jihadis, fundamentalists, etc.)?
&gt;
&gt;Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges.  When politically correct, tolerant, and culturally diverse societies agree to Muslim demands for their religious privileges, some of the other components tend to creep in as well.
&gt;
&gt;Here's how it works:
&gt;
&gt;As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:
&gt;
&gt;Australia -- Muslim 1.5%

&gt;Canada -- Muslim 1.9%

&gt;China -- Muslim 1.8%

&gt;Italy -- Muslim 1.5%

&gt;Norway -- Muslim 1.8%

&gt;South Africa – Muslim 1.8%

&gt;United States -- Muslim 0.6%
&gt;
&gt;At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs. This is happening in:
&gt;
&gt;Denmark -- Muslim 2%

&gt;Germany -- Muslim 3.7%

&gt;United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%

&gt;Spain -- Muslim 4%

&gt;Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%
&gt;
&gt;From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:
&gt;
&gt;France -- Muslim 8%

&gt;Philippines -- 5%

&gt;Sweden -- Muslim 5%

&gt;Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3%

&gt;The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5%

&gt;Trinidad &amp; Tobago -- Muslim 5.8%

What's wrong with halal? This would seem to be in line with the ideals of the free market and job creation. If Muslims have jobs, they'll be less likely to become disaffected and resort to political extremism. 
&gt;
&gt;At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law.  The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

Where has this happened?

&gt;When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections in:
&gt;
&gt;Guyana -- Muslim 10%

&gt;India -- Muslim 13.4%

India doesn't have as much of a problem with Muslims as it does with fundamentalist Hindus. The history of the country is marked by an ebb and flow of religious tension but there are more salient issues here - class, region, etc. The current tensions are primarily confined to Kashmir.

&gt;Israel -- Muslim 16%

Funny how it's wrong for Muslims to have madrassas and ""sharia"" but Jews are allowed to establish schools that are virtually autonomous of the government and segregated on the basis of gender and to seek resolution of social issues through purely religious courts. Also Israel has a problem with Palestinians, not so much Muslims as a whole group. There is a large Muslim population outside of the West Bank and Gaza (and that is politically separate from the Muslims in those areas). These people get along just fine. Might have something to do with the economic blockade of those areas and the fact that they are basically police states.

&gt;Kenya -- Muslim 10%

&gt;Russia -- Muslim 15%

Muslims are hardly the source of Russia's problems.

The most salient demographic indicators in the French riots were age and minority status, not religion.  Young non-white people are routinely harassed and detained by the police without committing any crime. There is rampant, high unemployment and very little economic opportunity. People with African sounding names are usually turned away from jobs. The triggering event for the riots was the detention and death of teenagers who were on their way home from playing soccer. French police investigations after the riots found no ""Islamist"" involvement. There was significant involvement in the riots by native French youth as well. The biggest cause of the riots was social alienation caused by racism.

The Mohammed cartoon business is silly to be sure.

&gt;
&gt;After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:
&gt;
&gt;Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8%

Ethiopia has been rather calm lately and the conflict is a result of regional separatism and religious infighting rather than fighting between religions.
&gt;
&gt;At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:
&gt;
&gt;Bosnia -- Muslim 40%

I was under the impression that the (Christian) Serbs perpetrated genocide against the Albanian Muslims, assisted by Croats and other Muslims. The wider Yugoslavian conflict has generally been about ethnicity, not religion. Croatia and Slovenia, which are less Muslim, have seen more conflict since the breakup. This goes against the argument.

&gt;Chad -- Muslim 53.1%

Chad has a lot of problems with religion being the least of them. It's kind of hard to be a good country when you're trying to repel a Libyan invasion on one side and stem the constant flow of refugees on the other, not to mention a perpetually corrupt state.

&gt;Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%

Ah yes, another complex situation reduced to ""It's the Muslims' fault. At independence, Christians had a plurality in the country and though the Muslim population has grown, the political elite have continually resisted a census that would reapportion political power. In fact, the government is based on the model of confessionalism, where specific political offices are handed out to specific religious groups. Parliament is divided among the various religious groups and while the Prime Minister must be a Muslim, they are appointed by the President, a Christian. When you institutionalize religion into government like this, especially in a pluralist country, there will be problems.
&gt;
&gt;From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:
&gt;
&gt;Albania -- Muslim 70%

&gt;Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4%

&gt;Qatar -- Muslim 77.5%

&gt;Sudan -- Muslim 70%
&gt;
&gt;After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:
&gt;
&gt;Bangladesh -- Muslim 83%

&gt;Egypt -- Muslim 90%

&gt;Gaza -- Muslim 98.7%

&gt;Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1%

&gt;Iran -- Muslim 98%

&gt;Iraq -- Muslim 97%

I think it's obvious that the conflict here is sectarian and wrapped up with a bunch of other factors besides religion.

&gt;Jordan -- Muslim 92%

&gt;Morocco -- Muslim 98.7%

&gt;Pakistan -- Muslim 97%

&gt;Palestine -- Muslim 99%

&gt;Syria -- Muslim 90%

&gt;Tajikistan -- Muslim 90%

&gt;Turkey -- Muslim 99.8%

&gt;United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%
&gt;

&gt;100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

I'm going to assume they mean Dar al Salaam here, rather than the largest city in Tanzania.

&gt;Afghanistan -- Muslim 100%

&gt;Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100%

&gt;Somalia -- Muslim 100%

Somalia is hardly peaceful and definitely not under any type of Muslim hegemony. If ever there was a case study for anarchy, this is it.

&gt;Yemen -- Muslim 100%
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.
&gt;“Before I was nine, I had learned the basic canon of Arab life. It was me against my brother; me and my brother against our father; my family against my cousins and the clan; the clan against the tribe; the tribe against the world, and all of us against the infidel.” -- Leon Uris, 'The Haj'

The Haj is a fictional work by an American author. Hardly a rigorous source for insight into Islam. Also, ""Arab""=/=Muslim

&gt;It is important to understand that in some countries, with well under 100% Muslim populations, such as France, the minority Muslim populations live in ghettos, within which they are 100% Muslim, and within which they live by Sharia Law. The national police do not even enter these ghettos.  There are no national courts, nor schools, nor non-Muslim religious facilities. In such situations, Muslims do not integrate into the community at large. The children attend madrasses. They learn only the Koran. To even associate with an infidel is a crime punishable with death. Therefore, in some areas of certain nations, Muslim Imams and extremists exercise more power than the national average would indicate.

And why do madrasses spring up? Because governments fail to provide for basic education. Take the case of Pakistan as an example. In that country, the government was more concerned with maintaining a defensive posture against India than providing basic services. The country itself was born with a feudal structure with a small political elite maintaining large land holdings and a sharecropping system. 

&gt;Today's 1.5 billion Muslims make up 22% of the world's population. But their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other believers. Muslims will exceed 50% of the world's population by the end of this century.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,default,Got an email with a grand theory of how Islam is taking over the world.

Why is it, when it comes to business, people adore local mom &amp; pop stores, as if local was better; but when it comes to politics, bigger is better. Hey progressive, your big government philosophy is the political equivalent of Walmart. The only difference between them is that big business has the incentive to be efficient; government does not, hence its budget deficits. Next time you feel that the federal government should solve a problem, just remember this philosophy: never solve at a higher level that which can be solved at a lower level. Solving problems at a higher level than is necessary expends more resources than would be required if it were handled more locally. This applies to everything.   
  
Education vs. military:   
There is no reason to have a federal program. There is no unique problem which only the federal government can solve regarding education. In fact the opposite is true. Problems in education are so unique to local communities that the federal government simply cannot address all of problems with the resources they use. However, the military is designed to address problems which threaten all the states and counties universally. There is also the synergistic element of combining funding for large scale weapons development which if applied to education would never work. It simply does not translate due to the nature of the problem.  
  
Private charity vs. government welfare:   
So many people have good hearts but are tainted by the narrative that the government must handle helping people out of financial crisis. A dollar spent at the federal level, because of high infrastructure costs, returns to communities at something like twenty five cents on the dollar. But the question is are they any better at allocating resources than local community organizations. No, it is impossible for them to gather that amount of information without spending more than they take in (again examine budget deficits).  But if not government, who? Either you believe that people are charitable enough to sustain organizations locally or not. I submit this bit of evidence to you: […individuals gave $211.77 billion (73%) representing a 2.7% increase over 2009.](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=42) The most importaint concept is that if the government stops forcing us to pay for inefficient government programs that money goes into the pockets of people at 100% without waste. This will allow charities to receive more in the way of donations. The workers in government would be forced to work in the private sector and contribute to the economy rather than being a drain to it by working for a government which produces nothing to benefit the GDP.

Personally, I think it would help the Republicans immensely with independents and moderates, especially in purple states. 

That said, I could also see it deflating support from core conservatives and tea partiers resulting in more of them staying home or going 3rd party with their votes. This could have a huge down ballot drag on the Republicans, hurting their chances to pick up seats in the house and senate and lending a boost to liberal voters initiatives like same sex marriage and marijuana legalization.

Elderly people typically have the time and resources to take more action in politics. The AARP is one of the largest lobbies in DC. 


However, as an internet-connected youth, I feel their over-weighted involvement is invalid for multiple reasons. Much of their idealogy is guided by a vision of America that no longer exists. Their sources of information may be severly lacking. And finally, many of them will not have to live with the consequences of their choices. 


I think this makes compromise and progress very difficult. They are unwilling to adjust Social Security or Medicare to take into account changing lifespans and costs. Simple ignorance and fear-peddling  makes some of them the first to think Obama is a Muslim-Socialist-Pigdog who is ruining our country. And lastly, much of the legislation that benefits the elderly is being paid for by the rest of us. 


Should the Baby Boomer generation consider the common good and take a reduced influence in politics? I feel it would speed up the rates of change on both key social issues and necessary reform. 

It reminds me of Jefferson's quote concerning enslavement to prior generations: 

&gt; The generations of men may be considered as bodies or corporations. Each generation has the usufruct of the earth during the period of its continuance. When it ceases to exist, the usufruct passes on to the succeeding generation free and unencumbered and so on successively from one generation to another forever. We may consider each generation as a distinct nation, with a right, by the will of its majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another country."" --Thomas Jefferson to John Wayles Eppes, 1813. ME 13:270


Granted, I think its perfectly valid to argue that younger generations should take an increased role to counter act aging lobbies, but I'm wondering what happened to what is good for the country as a whole and not just the oldest and most stubborn members of the country?


**EDIT**  To clarify a misunderstanding, I'm not talking about forcibly removing voting rights. I'm talking about a personal and voluntary decision of the elderly to step back.

If you were designing a world for you to live in, but you didn't know your gender, race, sexuality, where you'd be born, religion and other such factors, you would inevitably design a world in which all these things were equal.

My take:

war is only as just or noble as the consequences it causes. Many of them will be unintended. You judge a medicine by how effective it is at treating illness. Most wars make the preceding illnesses worse, which is hardly moral by.
The only reason a war SHOULD be fought is for a higher good. Usually, though, they are meant to benefit certain economies or private-interest groups. Perhaps this contributes to the WWI ban on any public mention of munitions companies' involvement in war politics.
Again, a war is only as just as its outcomes, which depends on the participants. War is not fought in the modern era by philosophers, or even by middle-class citizens. Often, it is fought by the poor, and historically armies have included a fair number of convicts. How moral is a war made up of those components? the answer is obvious.
Wilson's objectives were probably motivated by the greater good, but the outcome depends on businesses and political movements responding to the war's end.

* The DOJ's new Office of Legal Representation will be divided into the different circuits of the US Court system.  Legal Reps are chosen randomly, and may only serve for 5 years at a time in each circuit before moving to a new one.  They also must alternate between representing the plaintiffs and defendants.  The purpose of this is to avoid the creation of biases and so keep the representation fresh.

* OLR lawyers will be retained for a 6 year term of service in exchange for the cost of their education.  In addition to their yearly salary, they will also receive financial incentives for winning cases and client feedback.  

* OLR can be petitioned when there is a severe mis-match in legal representation of over $5,000.  Not quite sure how to work out the details with this...

How it would work:

* Say your a farmer, your happily growing food and earning your keep.  One day a truck carrying seeds to a neighboring farm drives by and a few seeds fall on your land.  The seeds are the same crop that you're growing, and you're none the wiser.  A few months later, you get a letter in the mail from Cornsanto.  They say you're infringing on their IP and that you are being sued.  These guys have a million dollar bankroll and you have $11,000 in the bank saved up for your kid's college.  You know if you fight it, then you may lose all that money and your livelihood.  Even if you don't fight it, you won't be able to pay for the licensing for the seeds, and you still lose.  It's happened to plenty of your neighbors, and it's happening to you.  Fortunately, you can petition for OLR mediation.  By doing this, both parties are assigned legal representation randomly and you both pay a small $500 fee.  They can't use their millions of dollars to drag out the fight and bleed you dry, and you get your day in court.  A win isn't guaranteed, but this way, the playing field is a bit even.

I dunno how to truly work this idea out, but watching stuff like Food Inc, and documentaries about Hot Coffee led me to believe that our legal system is fucked up and only goes to the highest bidder.  Even if you're righteous, you will still lose in the end financially and be worse off than when you started.  It's like David vs. Goliath, except David has no sling.

They are very real, honest good people and often give us very visceral and sometimes amazing (many times good, and many times horrifying) accounts of scenes they see and/or saw as they play out. The clients we have do travel throughout the neighboring countries in Eastern Africa (Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia, etc.).

So, after all the fanfare this video from Innocent Children has received, my coworkers and I have talked about it and all agreed about a few things that really are quite annoying/upsetting:

5) It Looks Like a Presidential Campaign:
First off, Kony 2012 completely looks like a campaign. You know there are going to be some idiots (or hipsters) that vote for him on write-in ballots, just because they heard about it so much (or to be ironic). Why would they even do that. The mere appearance of it's similarity is obnoxious by nature.

4) Why 2012?:
Obviously, IC wants to make it a public issue so politicians HAVE to talk about it. However, we already sent 100 US military and intelligence officers there to assist in the capture of the Lord's Resistance Army leaders (and we're not even sure Kony is alive: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/us-strategic-interests-uganda). So, isn't that game over? 

And look what we have here, politicians looking at military action:
http://vtdigger.org/2012/03/09/digger-tidbits-as-kony-video-goes-viral-leahy-sets-hearings-on-funding-for-apprehending-ugandan-warlord-shumlin-lashes-out-at-limbaugh-records-requests-denied-in-duclos-case/

3) How do people get involved?:
Isn't the point of most charities to HELP PEOPLE through their actions. I mean, making that guy known and how he sucks is all well and good. BUT I have a major issue when you're asking people to donate so you can make more movies and advertising product so that Kony can become presiden... I mean get found and arrested.

Furthermore, his making it a public issue is really so that the politicians get pressured by the people into military action in yet another random location in the world that will have unintended consequences. He is really pushing for Uganda's Army to chase this guy down, but pushing for all the countries to agree on allowing a foreign army to search for a small band of rebels is inviting a lot of issues to explode at once in an unstable region.

So... your donations go to IC which = more advertising about capturing this guy with is basically more or less pushing gov'ts to take military action. Not really so humanistic IMHO.

2) Misleading Campaign:
Regardless of his expenses, it seems that he's not getting much love from Ugandans in the blogosphere (http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/ugandans-say-kony-film-is-misleading-too-late/story-e6frfku0-1226295428056) and it's mostly because the Lord's Resistance Army IS NOT IN UGANDA ANYMORE and hasn't been SINCE 2006!

I think this snarky Singaporean article sums it up nicely (http://newnation.sg/2012/03/outdated-video-about-uganda-war-goes-viral/), but basically Russel's moment has passed him by and he's still pushing for justice in Uganda, because he made some promise to one guy and completely ignored all the other issues that people actually CAN help out with in Africa. Which leads me to my BIGGEST issue...

1) Why focus on KONY, when there are so many HUMANISTIC causes that don't get enough attention (in East Africa alone!):

-East Africa's Famine:
http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/07/20/iyw.howtohelp.somalia.famine/index.html
http://matadornetwork.com/change/mapping-the-food-crisis-and-famine-in-east-africa/
*This is what really pisses me off. Kony killed and kidnapped tens of thousands over 20 years../
Meanwhile, the famine, which has been ongoing since JULY 2011 has killed an average of 0.6-2.8 people per 10,000 per day (with an affected area of about 9.5 million people). It has furthermore displaced close to a million people. To add to complications, 30% of the affected area are acutely malnourished and that same area of people are at high risk of malaria or cholera.

Humanitarian agencies have also only received about half the amount of supplies they need. All of  this is further complicated by the fact that Al-Shabab has claimed alliance to AL Qaeda and the USA followed their declaration by naming them an international terrorist group and drastically cutting aid funding to Somalia.

So, there is a cry for the help of human lives that is within need and there are groups set up to help and THIS IS WORTH CONTRIBUTING TO!
http://www.oxfam.org/
http://www.mercycorps.org/
http://www.one.org/international/
http://www.unicef.org.uk/
*Many of these programs also support human rights causes, education, healthcare, etc.

-Malaria (throughout all of Africa):

-Riders for Health - Providing medicines to people in far reaching areas!
http://www.riders.org/
*This is very cool and I learned about it through Ian McClellan's documentary Long Way Down. These guys make sure health workers are able to provide consistent healthcare support to people in isolated areas.


**EDIT:**
I must say that making a previously unknown monster and his horrible deeds known is a good cause in and of itself. I'm sorry, I guess I sort of just assumed that this would be understood.

The fact that he made Kony famous is not what bothers me, it is the means to which IC has reached this point and the endgame goal they're trying to get to, even after the US already send 100 troops to Uganda in Nov 2011 (which IC claims is due to their efforts). He seems to be making pretty good grip off their plight.

Furthermore, I have come across a well written piece on the subject on Kony and the complications of internet activism. The part below sums up my complicated feelings about the whole Kony campaign:

""Ok, so maybe you can lobby people. This worked with SOPA, right? It has to work with Kony. Well, with SOPA the problem was a bill that was about to be voted on by each and every state representative. Easy to figure out who to pester there. With Kony, you’re talking about a matter of international politics that could possibly require out-and-out military action to solve and it’s on a continent that’s still reeling from the fact that nearly all of its countries’ governments and borders were pretty arbitrarily defined by a bunch of culturally ignorant Imperialist politicians in the late 1800s to boot. It’s pretty complicated, and I think you’d probably have a really hard time finding the right person to talk to much less figuring out what to say to them.""",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,"The Kony 2012 Campaign, why it really angers me",http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/qos65/the_kony_2012_campaign_why_it_really_angers_me/,,,1.0,2010

I'm not the first to criticize the campaign, nor will I be the last. But let's at least revisit some key points here.

What is propaganda? From the Oxford dictionary it is defined: [mass noun] information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.

The goal of the Kony 2012 campaign doesn't bother me. It's clear that Kony is someone who is indeed a troubling character who needs to be removed from power.

Let's take another look at the documentary that is circulating.

The director, Jason Russel, is very good at employing tactics to make us interested in the subject matter but it's very one sided. That itself isn't so much the problem, Kony is clearly doing a lot of damage and needs to be stopped.

I just find the Russel so condescending. In the end, he makes anyone feel stupid/arrogant for not knowing that Kony was committing these atrocities, thanking the heavens for facebook and other online media that they're able to help raise awareness.

But it all seems so fake. I see everyone crying in the documentary and I just feel like they're trying to suck us into a cheap call to action; every second it's ""look how sad everyone is. This has been going on SO long and you didn't know about it. Well, now's the time to help fix it, so buy our action kit to help raise awareness, and 'make him famous.'"" Some call to action. This is just first world guilt extended to 2012, this is nothing new. I saw comments on some ten year old articles, stating something like ""these articles are from 2002."" All of a sudden one documentary has everyone captivated? This movie doesn't change us into a less ignorant generation, it highlights it.

On the one hand, I feel I should support it; on the other hand, Invisible Children and their followers aren't contributing to society by making a terrorist famous, plastering his name and face everywhere. At the beginning the director says ""if this happened in America it would be front page news."" Yeah? What about the issues of the homeless, exclusive medical care, exclusive education and a financial gap that makes these problems even worse; a problem that exists in American cities everywhere? Just because the killing is more obvious in Uganda doesn't mean it doesn't exist at home. This White privilege] just reeks of arrogance.

So many times does Russell call the (white/privileged) viewer to action--they have to have to Internet to view the video by the way, and that's not inclusive, that's exclusive. No where in the documentary or on the website are there links to the history of events in Uganda; no means or access to educate us further on the issue. From the website, kony2012, there is no means other than the documentary to educate yourself, and the documentary does little of that. What kind of political situation existed that allows Kony to rise to power? Why isn't that addressed? How was he allowed to negotiate peace talks if it was so obvious what he was doing? These are the underlying issues that are glossed over in favour of the ""donate"" and ""get the kit"" buttons at the button.

I'm can't help but be skeptical in this situation, but I'm simply not as liberal a person as I once was. I'm trying to make a future after coming out of school with enormous debt in a country that is facing battles about online privacy while the country next door is still battling it out over contraceptives. I have first world problems. So does Invisible Children and their followers. Ignoring their own problems for third world problems twenty years after the fact does not automatically make you a better person. The filmmaker has spent a lot of his own time and money traveling back and forth and orchestrating this campaign, and I respect HIM for that. The sheep who follow him? It's nice to say that facebook has united the world and that the Internet is a democratizing medium...but lets take baby steps.

As usual, we're sidestepping issues here.

The Internet is not a democratizer. It in no way reveals the true intentions of 'the people.' The people is not 700 million twenty and thirty somethings. 'The people' are infants, children, toddlers, senior citizens, the mentally challenged, the physically handicapped. THESE ARE PEOPLE. There's an assumption that anyone can use the Internet. Well, no, that's not true at all. Some people who have access to the Internet can't use it through handicaps, disinterest, or aversion. Some who can use it, want to use it, or beg to use it, can't because of government restrictions or general lack of access. We need to stop pretending like the Internet is bringing everyone together.

I'm writing this later in the day. When I wrote most of this diatribe before I even knew about the support  Invisible Children had been giving to the Ugandan military, or photographs of IC members posing with weaponry had been released or their mismanaged and oddly allocated funding, which really just amplified most of my concerns. For a moment, though, let's look at the other side of this. Other than giving support to the Ugandan military, what options are there? The economic reality of the situation is that there is no other military the UN found capable of supporting. So to the critics who chastise Invisible Children for supporting a violent military regime, I don't see how you're any different than IC themselves with their biased and uninformed viewpoint. Do you really think Kony's is the only violent force out there in Africa? The reality of most of this situation is horrifying on both sides, but the economic and social reality is that there is almost no other way for the UN and Invisible Children to step in.

For not the first time I'm worried about this hipster/occupy generation of people growing up, since they're entranced in this propaganda. With the Internet access to research and education is easy, so why isn't IC willing to provide sources so we can check their facts? Why aren't the followers or detractors checking theirs? I hope that we're not too easily satisfied with these simplistic answers, but that seems to be the ultimate reasoning. After watching to documentary I felt like Jason Russel had sat me down, much like he sat down with his son, and explained the situation in the most simplistic of terms: ""this guy Kony is bad, but no one is doing anything about him."" It's blatant manipulation.

In the end I really hope we can develop the critical reasoning of at least some members of this generation so that Invisible Children can really be put to the challenge of making a difference instead of all too easily making this propaganda.

But I'm referring to those who are born into welfare, have children early, who then go on welfare and continue the cycle.

Never mind the Ides of March, beware the Surprises of October


Obama is scheduled today to deliver a much ballyhooed speech to AIPAC, which bills itself as the most influential foreign policy lobby in America. According to various news articles, Obama will reiterate his recent boasts that ""he does not bluff"" and that it is ""unacceptable"" to America for Iran to develop the bomb.

How should we conservatives react to the speech?

First we should understand Obama's motivations for the speech and our own misconceptions about Obama himself and his foreign policy.

Our misconceptions about Obama are easy to state, we conservatives regard him in the realm of foreign policy to be Jimmy Carter with anemia. We think he is a typical McGovern liberal who will shrink from military action even when the national interests of America require nothing less. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Obama's motivation for making the speech are also easy to misjudge. Yes, we understand that he is no doubt desperate to recover the erosion he has sustained in the Jewish vote. We understand that, historically, the Jewish vote and not less Jewish financial support have been absolutely indispensable to Democrat victories in national elections. Indeed, there are studies that show that when the Jewish vote at the national level falls below 60 to 70%, Democrats do not win the election. It is difficult to overstate the electoral power of the concentrated Jewish vote, the propaganda value of Jewish financial contributions, the moral power of Jewish opinion makers toward installing Democrats in the White House.

So, yes, Obama is making a speech to the Israeli lobby to reestablish that vital relationship which has so often succored Democrats but which now is so frayed as to be at the point of sundering. But Obama is aiming for much more and we must understand the scope of his ambitions.

We think that Obama is in a box in which he is trapped by his ideology and destined to lose Jewish vote. To the contrary, it is we who are in a box.

Let us return now to our misconceptions about Barack Obama and to do that let us revisit some of our assumptions about the unnatural marriage between The Left and Islamism. We often ponder why The Left has lent support to a homophobic, misogynist, theocratic ideology which will cheerfully murder most leftists as soon as it obtains power? We have uneasily and perhaps tentatively concluded that the left is operating on the old principle, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend.""

The enemy, a robust and Democratic United States of America which, so long as it stands on its feet, stands athwart the path of socialist utopia. Both militant Islam and The Left regard America as the enemy because it is the principal obstacle to the imposition of Sharia for one and statism for the other. Many have opined that Obama's fecklessness in the war against suicidal, murderous, militant Islam is simply because he is a closet Mohammedan.

I do not subscribe to that view but I do believe that he is a Marxist and a Black Liberationist which is to say that he instinctively despises America and would reflexively side with her enemies providing that does not damage world socialism or his own personal ambitions.

The idea that Obama is a weak Jimmy Carter leftist constitutionally afraid of military action misjudges the man. Most leftists do not shrink from blood. We are accustomed to viewing Hitler as the most bloodthirsty man of the 20th century but a comparison with other communist dictators, as has been made by The Black Book of Communism, reveals that it is Stalin and Mao who can claim that dubious honor. On a percentage basis, the left generally murders more of its population than did even Hitler, his Jewish victims excepted.

Since Roe vs. Wade the left has facilitated the death of over 40 million babies and Barak Obama in his time has been foremost among the champions of abortion. Indeed, he has gone on record supporting the murder of babies who have miraculously survived the abortionist's knife. The idea that Obama would shrink from seeing blood on his own hands is without support in his biography.

I share the view of many that Obama is a narcissist, a cardinal characteristic of which is lack of conscience. When Obama opposed the war in Iraq I believe he did so because he opposed one of the aims of the war, to turn Iraq into a fulcrum to effect the democratization of Islam and render it a bulwark in the middle of the Muslim world for democracy and capitalism. I do not believe that he opposed the war over scruples about military adventurism.

When, as commander-in-chief Obama has to decide between pacifism in the face of a threat to his personal ascendancy as President of the United States, he will choose war. I believe that leftists to date have supported militant Islam and its jihad against America because they believe that at the end of the day they will stand over a prostrate America and vanquish the Muslim threat leaving the field to themselves alone.

This is the way communists have operated from the beginning. That is why we had a Molotov/Ribbentrop pact. When the time comes they will sacrifice any number of lives for their own ideology.

So we can expect Obama in today's speech to aim much higher than reconsolidation with the American Jewish voting block. I believe he will lay the predicate for an October Surprise which will involve military action against Iran's nuclear establishment and along the Straits of Hormuz. If Iran reacts by attempting to close the Straits of Hormuz, so much the better from Obama's point of view.

He will expect, and he will get, not just a reconciliation of Jewish voters but the support of evangelicals who identify with Israel and plain old-fashioned American patriots who predictably will rally around the flag and rush to support their President.

He is laying the predicate for an October Surprise in today's speech. Can anyone imagine that he will strike, if he does strike, after and not before the election? The timing will unmask Obama's cynicism. We must unmask him now!

Our difficulty will be that he will be right to strike Iran and it will be difficult to demonstrate that Obama is not acting to save the nation as well as Israel. Right now, every American who fills his car at the pump has reason to curse Obama but all that will be washed away in a flood of patriotic fervor when the missiles fly. Obama will be right to strike but his motives will be absolutely corrupt.

We are in a box.

It will be almost impossible to convince the public that they should vote against Obama's reelection by arguing that his motives were corrupt even as we concede that his policy was correct.

Nevermind the Ides of March, beware the Surprises of October.

Recently, while playing the first MassEffect I stumbled upon a bit of trivia related to the way the Quarian government works. Their civilian government gets first say but the military government can veto decisions made by them. This is where it gets interesting - if an override veto occurs the entire military government (Admiralty) must resign.

(more here http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Migrant_Fleet#Politics_and_Military_Policy )

This got me wondering- is it possible, to somehow apply this idea to modern government, where they, the decision makers of our countries are accountable (at the cost of their jobs/postions)?

Here in New Zealand the ruling party (National) seems to like invoking the ""under urgency"" thing to rush through pieces of legislation without proper consultation with the public. I wonder if this would occur if they had to step down after pushing through any legislation in this manner.

So can we apply this? Can we give them the power to make important, swift decisions but at the same time make them accountable for what they do? Is this even a feasible idea in the current system(s)?

Well, Rush is 4X divorced. He was caught with an illegal prescription of viagra when he went to the Dominican without a female companion. The Dominican is 2nd, only behind Thailand, in the sex tourism &amp; sex trade industry. Looks like Limp Dick's only reliable source of female attention are whores.

Now, let's look at his career.

Rush's fame &amp; fortune came as a result of his tenure with Clear Channel. Clear Channel originally gave Rush's show free-of-charge to its affiliates in exchange for all or most of the advertising time (which would pay for the show). As long as Limpdick has been on Clear Channel he's been prostituting himself (whoring himself is more accurate) as he sells out his fellow countrymen in order to spread the lies &amp; propaganda of his corporate overlords. That explains why Rush is always so angry on the show. He knows he's sold his soul for his thirty pieces from the rich &amp; powerful corporatists who own him.

It all too easily explains his need to demean women with derogatory words like ""slut"", ""whore"" &amp; ""prostitute"".

* On February 29th, Obama used a national security rationale to cause a change in the prosecution process that would have lead to indefinite detention.

If Republican ideas are sound and good, why are there almost NO Republican cities in America? And further, of those Republican cities, which are ones people would actually want to go to? Where are the ones making lots of money and are good for businesses and people? You know, the low tax, small government, business havens? Where are the bustling Republican metropolises?

We only have two major parties in this country, which is pretty geographically, politically, socially, and religiously diverse. Yet, extremely few cities go republican and the ones that do aren't thriving, aren't places of culture, or where anyone is super stoked to go. Tulsa, for example, who the hell cares about it? Hell, even Dallas voted for Obama in 2008.

So my question is: If this is the case (prove me wrong?), what does that say about republican ideas? Perhaps that they work on the small scale (rural areas) but aren't really reasonable for large groups of people? I mean, cities make more money for states (and the country) than the rural areas. In fact, here in Washington state, our major county (King County) basically pays out tax dollars for every other county in the state, getting back only 61 cents for every dollar in taxes we generate. We subsidize the rural areas to an almost laughable degree. Yet, the rural areas always vote republican and vote to cut taxes.

He then went on to correct himself by discussing the subject as he should have by including all details he left out before as well his respective opinions (which I found more insightful and accurate to what he stands for anyways, and not at all inflammatory). What more do people want? What else can we really expect? Why should his career be so damaged over one word when so many celebrities make equally immoral mistakes every day and are forgiven? After all, he has a right to say what he wants on a private radio station paid for by advertising so long as he meets FCC standards, doesnt he? Well, that's my view on it. I'm genuinely curious as to why his apology isn't being accepted. Am I missing something?

*The truth is our founding fathers would be seen as the enemy by the GOP if they were alive and running today.*


Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the laws of nature that he configured when he created all things. God is thus conceived to be wholly transcendent and never immanent. For Deists, human beings can only know God via reason and the observation of nature, but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles) – phenomena which Deists regard with caution if not skepticism. See the section Features of deism, following. Deism can also refer to a personal set of beliefs having to do with the role of nature in spirituality.[10] Deism does not ascribe any specific qualities to a deity beyond non-intervention. Deism is related to naturalism because it credits the formation of life and the universe to a higher power, using only natural processes.




Critical elements of deist thought included:

  *  Rejection of all religions based on books that claim to contain the revealed word of God.
  *  Rejection of all religious dogma and demagogy.
  *  Rejection of reports of miracles, prophecies and religious ""mysteries"".

Constructive elements of deist thought included:

  *  God exists, created and governs the universe.
  *  God gave humans the ability to reason.


Specific thoughts on aspects of the afterlife will vary.

I'm pretty bad at understanding politics, in fact most of what I know is thanks to Reddit lately, so I thought you guys would be the ones to ask. 

Pretty horrible at explaining things too so forgive me (and my grammar xD ) I was just watching some Jon Steward vs Bill O'Reily interviews and I thought I understood it. If I understand their (in general) points correctly it seems that Bill looks at the situation from somewhat of a neutral standpoint, he sees the problem and sees solutions to it. Where as Jon focuses more on the smaller things, the people and their struggles, among other things. 

Err, this is where the bad explaining comes in at, see? The only example I can think of is Scrubs - Bill would Dr. Kelso (Chief of Medicine) and Jon would be (Dr. Cox) - Kelso has to focus on keeping the the hospital afloat and the bigger picture, where as Dr. Cox is mostly concerned with the sick people, the employees and what he feels matters more.

It seems like a silly thing, I'm sure but I think if I understand that much I can understand more about politics and the way the world works. (I can be pretty neutral, myself - seeing both sides) So if I'm understanding it right, neither is the bad guy they just fix things differently - Bill being neutral to the causes where as Jon kind of takes a more 'the people' stance.

* The Obama Administration, under the terms of the PPACA, requires all health plans to cover contraception with no co-pay.

* Obama Administration modifies ruling, so insurance companies have to pay for contraception if their customers have religious objections.
* Catholic organizations object again, assuming that insurance companies will pass along costs of no co-pay contraception to the organization: in effect, forcing them (again) to pay for contraception.

the‘‘Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011’’.

 which calls a concern of people being disorderly and disruptive in ths way:

""whoever: knowingly, and with intent to impede and disrupt the orderly conduct of business or official functions engages in disorderly or disruptive conduct in, or within such proximity to any restricted building or grounds when, or so that such conduct, in fact impeeds or disrupts the orderly conduct of government business"" (HR 347 Sec. A sub section 2). Last time I checked, that was how we protest government from doing things like pass bad laws or take away our rights.

 ""The punishment for violation of subsection (a) is:

‘(1) a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, if— ‘(A) the person, during and in relation to the offense, uses or carries a deadly or dangerous weapon or firearm; or‘‘(B) the offense results in significant bodily injury as defined by section 2118(e)(3); and ‘‘(2) a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, in any other case"".(section b, sub sect. 1 parts a and b)

Making this act a penalty is a violation of our First Amendment which gives the right to ""the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble"" (U.S Bill of Rights, First Amendment). The first 5 words of this amendment is ""congress shall make NO LAW"", and doing such makes what they have done unconstitutional.

 

HR 347 goes on to state that, ""the term 'restricted buildings or grounds' means any posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area (A) the White house, or its grounds, (B) of a Building or Grounds where the president or other person protected by the secrect service""(presidential candidates, senators, foreign dignitaries) is or will be temporarily visiting; or of a building or grounds so restricted in conjection with an event designated as a special event of national significance (presidential inaugerations, the superbowl etc.)

This definition means that we have lost to do the most American thing we can, which is Protest our President, and those that wish to be our leaders, and run our country. Who is to say what our federal government wishes to deem a ""restricted building"" the people must always be able to have access to protest our leaders, and if we cant do so where it is restricted, and government can make any area ""restricted by having government officals present"" then it is illegal to protest anywhere and everywhere in the United states of America, except where our leaders are not.

This bill was passed by both our house and Senate and signed by Barrack Obama in secret and not released to the Main Media. Luckily due to the freedom of Information Act, all information that our government conducts must be accesible to everyone and the act is published online at this adress: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr347enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr347enr.pdf. 


Protest is effective, and our founding fathers made the right for people to assemble and create a militia as our second amendment, which is the next   neccesary action if our ability to protest our government because void. This is not a call to arms, but a call to protest, for this is the very time such an action is neccesary. Our media is corruptted by businesses, that only tell us what they want us to hear. Our government is corrupted by businesses, having legislateres pander to the richest 1%, and have proven they have truely forgotten their promise to serve in the best interest of the people, rather then their own checkbook. They have suppressed our 1st amendment right, by creating laws to not allow conduct that ""disrupts the conduct of government"", and protests have to be disruptive, its the point, or they are ignored, and Protests are MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY ARE NOT LEGAL. the first amendment also give the people the right to petition government for a ""redress of grievences"", and that is exactly what I inted to do. Lets petition Government to repeal this unconstitutional Law, before it has to go through the slow process of being reviewed by the courts. now whos with me? 

This bill was passed in secret, and was not exposed to mass media, which falls on Social Media as the last hope of awareness for such an unconstituional action. By passing this Law, our congress has created legislature that deems protest illegal, and is a tyranical action, and that is exactly what our first amendment is for, to protest tyranical actions. When the Founding Fathers created the Constitution, the country was still split between two sides, those that allied with the british, and considered our founding fathers treasonists, and those that sided with the founding fathers and called the British Government Tyranical. It was for this very purpose, that we have the Bill of Rights say all people have the right to peacefully assemble and protest what their government, does, and be able to be a participating force in democracy.

With that being said it is also important to note that in Florida there was a law recently passed called ""The Stand Your Ground"" law, which says that if one is threatened there is no need to try and retreat, but instead the person who is being threatened can ""stand their ground"" and escalate the use of force (yes, this includes the use of deadly force). According to Zimmerman, the boy attacked him and he acted in self defense. However there are no eye witnesses, and Zimmerman has stated that it was him who was screaming in the 911 calls, not the boy. If this is the case then it isn't inconceivable that Zimmerman acted within the law in defending himself (as crazy as that is).  So I'd be interested in hearing just how he will be charged. Obviously there is only one witness who saw what actually happened, and that's Zimmerman, and his story is obviously going to be in his favor. So what types of evidence do you think the FBI and DOJ will bring into play to prove that the shooting was indeed illegal. If it actually transpired the way he said (which I find doubtful) then he actually had the right to use deadly force to protect himself.

On another note if he gets off then this will be fertile ground for a race riot (even if the shooter was Hispanic). But these things aren't supposed to come into play during a prosecution. Remember that Zimmerman still hasn't been charged with any crime, even though the DOJ and FBI are investigating. ",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,The Trayvon Martin case.

I'm hoping this won't be mindlessly downvoted, so we can have an actual discussion regarding the war on drugs. The content below is from [1] Carolyn C. Gargaro.

**PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT UNLESS YOU HAVE READ THE POINTS MADE AND ARE RESPONDING TO THEM**

I'd like to present the following reasons why I believe we should continue this ""war."" There are citations aplenty, and I'm hoping to have an intellectual discussion on this matter.

** Argument 1: ""But taking drugs is an individual's choice....""**

First, we don't have the right to do anything we want with our body. Can I walk down the street naked? Can I say what I want anywhere I want? (if you said ""yes"" to the last question, try yelling ""hijack"" on a plane and get back to me.) The point is, we can't do anything we want with our body. In addition to people not being able to do ""whatever they want"" with their bodies, drugs do NOT just hurt the person who chooses to use them. 

For instance - I am sure people have heard about flashbacks from LSD. So, let's people stay inside in their own home and take LSD - that can't hurt anyone - right? After all, it's in their private home - right? LSD can cause flashbacks years after taking the drug, at any time. Is that person going to have a flashback while sitting at home - or while driving? Or while operating machinery? If that person has a flashback while driving the bus and an accident results, will people be so quick to say that the bus driver's ""choice"" to take LSD didn't hurt anyone else? People and their rights don’t exist in a vacuum. 

The notion that drugs only hurt the people who use them is very shallow and illogical. One needs to look beyond themselves and look at the entire picture, and it becomes obvious that drugs have drastic effects on MANY people besides those who use them. For instance, according to a 1994 Newsweek report on child abuse, ""Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common."" It is also estimated that 100,000 babies a year are born addicted to cocaine. I don't think these babies chose to take these drugs. 

Don't tell me that drugs only hurt the user - Tell that to a crack baby. Tell that to a woman who is raped by her boyfriend while he was high on PCP. Or tell that to the six year old that is raped by that same guy....Tell that to the taxpayers who will be paying out the wazoo for higher insurance rates, more taxes for drug rehabilitation programs, and more money for court cases due to the increased number of drug related offenses.

**Argument 2: ""The Drug War isn't Working..We need to try something else.""**

Well, the Drug War was working....and then we elected Bill Clinton as President. We can win the drug war without resorting to legalization, as shown by the consistent decrease in drug use from 1979 and 1992. However, under Bill Clinton, the drug use rate among youth aged 12-17 has increased 106 percent and marijuana use among young people has increased 141 percent. (""Preliminary Estimates from the 1995 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse,"" U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 8/96) 

In 1993 and 1994, President Clinton made seven addresses to the Nation; none mentioned illegal drugs. 

The President's 1993 presidential papers reveal 13 references to illegal drugs in a total 1,628 presidential statements, addresses, and interviews. 

Of 1,742 presidential statements and other utterances in 1994, illegal drugs were mentioned only 11 times. (""National Drug Policy: A Review of the Status of the Drug War,"" House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, H.Rept. 104-486, 3/19/96) 

When Clinton took office in 1992, he slashed the White House Office of Drug Control Policy by 80% and cut the number of drug enforcement - agents and their training. His National Security Council dropped the war on drugs from THIRD priority to last - 29th out of 29. (Star Tribune, 2/14/93) His Attorney General, Janet Reno, criticized minimum mandatory jail sentences for drug crimes. 

His Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, called for studying the legalization of drugs. Between 1993 and 1994, the number of aircraft and ships devoted to drug interdiction was cut in half. Even other Democrats have voiced concern on Clinton's non-existent drug policies. 

Congressman Charles Rangel pointed out, ""I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that’s been so silent on this great challenge (illegal drugs) to the American people.""

**Argument 3: ""Legalizing Drugs Will Reduce Crime..""**

Crime will also not be reduced by drug legalization. Studies show a correlation between drug use and crime - violent crimes such as homicides, assaults and domestic violence. Why is this? It's quite simple - drugs cause violent behavior.

Has anyone considered that the reason that people committed a crime was because they were ON drugs in the first place - legal or not? That they weren't necessarily committing a crime to get illegal drugs, but the drugs themselves caused a violent behavior (which would not magically go away if the drugs were legal) which lead them to committing a crime - something that would not have happened if they had not TAKEN drugs? In actuality, crime will rise when drugs are legal because more people will be taking drugs. Crime is high in high-drug use areas not because people are committing a crime to get drugs, but the influence of the drugs made them more inclined to commit a crime. For instance:

A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association (7/6/94) reports that cocaine use is linked to high rates of homicide in New York City and that ""homicide victims may have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking or verbal and physical aggression which are known to be pharmacologic effects of cocaine.""

Data from the National Institute of Justice (U.S. Department of Justice) Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program underscore the crime-drugs link. Of a sample of males arrested in 23 U.S. cities in 1993, the percent testing positive for at least one drug in the DUF survey ranged from 54% in Omaha to 81% in Chicago. Among female arrestees, the percent testing positive for any drug in 20 cities ranged from 42% in San Antonio to 83% in Manhattan.
The violent behavior caused by drugs won't magically stop because the drugs are legal. Legal PCP isn't going to make a person less violent than illegally purchased PCP. So, crimes committed because of drugs will increase as the number of drug users increase with the legalization of drugs. The psychopathic behavior that drugs cause will not somehow magically stop because drugs are legal.

Legalization proponents ignore the fact that the people committing violent crimes are career criminals who will not stop their illegal activities once drugs are legalized; they will instead seek new sources of illicit revenue.

I am not denying that some of the present crime is due to the profit motive behind illegal drugs. I admit that causes crime. However, if drugs were legal, not only would there be an increased crime rate due to the increased number of people who were taking drugs, but there would still be a ""black market"" and profit motive, which brings me to my next point..The Black Market.

Many argue that the element of profit would be eliminated. If drugs were legal, it is suggested that they would be sold at regulated government stores. Or according to economist Milton Friedman, at ""ordinary retail outlets."" Other legalizers say that drugs would be given out to the poor addicts who could not afford them.

William F. Buckley believes prices would be low enough to wipe out the black market. Buyers would, however, be heavily taxed to pay for drug education programs and rehabilitation centers.

Yet the tax would make it possible for criminals to undercut the official price and continue to rake in profits. So then what does the government do? Make prices so low that a second-grader with a few pennies can afford it and leave them no revenue for the proposed program? And think about this: drug related crimes are the highest where crack is the cheapest.
In addition to the official price being undercut, there are drugs that even most legalizers agree are too dangerous to make legal, such as crack and PCP. So guess what! Unless we legalize crack, PCP, and heroin, the black market will still exist for the more dangerous drugs. Now, let me stress this again - even if drugs are legalized, there will still be a black market for them. I stress this because people continue to write to me wailing ""But legal drugs will get rid of the black market!"" The black market argument is old, unfounded, and not logical. And even if legalization eliminated the black market, does this mean we legalize everything to avoid a black market? Let's legalize stealing - after all, then these poor robbers won't have to sneak around, and possible harm someone out of fright. See, we can cut down on deaths by legalizing robbery! Sound silly? Exactly.

It is my contention that Fox is responsible for Iraq invasion at the least, they protected and apologized for EVERY Bush disaster, (Iraq to Medicare Part D, both of which have skyrocketed our debt and lost all credible trust). Now they fabricate and trump every little thing Obama does into evil and a reason the country is in such bad shape.

 Never mind the fact it was the policies THEY Supported for 8 years that put us here. 3 tax cuts and 2 wars. Butter and Guns!! No wonder we are in so much debt, but during those years they had excuse after excuse why we had to..

Fox has much too large impact on US politics and laws than a single infotainment channel should have. All roads to the Republican WH lead through Fox and Roger Ailes' desk alone. Even the Tea Party was commandeered  by Fox, used like a hooker and thrown to the curb with OWS after their need was over. HOw many candidates are on the fucking payroll???

Does that not scare anyone else? 

*If Obama is guilty of anything it is not cleaning up Bush/Fox's mess fast enough.*  The only honest candidate is Dr Ron Paul, but I am afraid some of the the things he says I can not stand behind either. Our nation is hurting and we need a real leader. I can't see one for the life of me and I feel Fox 'news' has a lot of culpability playing to the worst of us, instead of real solutions and self critical introspection which we desperately need. No more excuses!

Just like Iraq, they are sending us down the wrong road with Iran. Russian troops are now reported arrived in Syria.. The drumbeat for war with Iran will lead to WW3. Just like Iraq -&gt; the fall out will be used as more propaganda by Fox against their political opponents, regardless they wanted the war more than anyone else. e.g. Gas prices are a real-time great example. The louder the war with Iran, the higher the gas prices will climb the more they shit on Obama.

Whether it is cost or morality, the public debate seems to lean toward women being the only ones whose decisions are being tied to the consequences.


I believe that family planning is applicable to the entire family. Responsible men participate in the decision about birth control. Using condoms when the risk of sexually transmitted diseases has not been eliminated is an intelligent choice that a couple makes, but only the man has to use those. When only the husband has income, the ""couple"" pays for the homemaker wife's health costs. A committed couple chooses the method that is right for ""them"".

Only the woman can get pregnant, but the decision about bringing the child into the world and providing for it, is for both to weigh in on. The future of the children to whom they have already committed their resources, is directly impacted by the arrival of a new member.

That society as a whole would benefit from responsible decisions about becoming parents seems like common sense. That insurance coverage for contraception would ultimately result in overall health and financial benefits does not seem like a contradiction.

Is it better for Democracies to allow organizations who hold radical ideals to spew their hatred for others in public and then engage them in a debate?

Or is it more effective to have the government ""regulate hate"" by censoring symbols of hate groups and denying them opportunities to hold rallies in public? Rather than give these radicals air time, governments could just rely on a moderate central education system to create moderate, open citizens.

But then again, it wouldn't be reddit without the customary comment regarding grammer, hah.

The type of activism generated by this video has been about: a.) commercial activism, which can be summed up as ""buy these posters, put them up, then forget about it!"" and ""donate here, and let other people do it for you."" and b.) information spreading ---- while useful, is only one element of activism; which, when left alone without other combined efforts, tends to lose meaning and momentum.

I'm happy that more people are talking about this atrocity. But WHY are more people talking about it? Because it is viral internet activism. It ignites peoples' innate empathy, and that empathy demands a response -- but responses are dictated by the information's medium. The nature of HOW this information spread scares me -- because this type of information IS NOT constitutive of MEANINGFUL, ENDURING knowledge. The video, and how it has spread to quickly, is orientalist at heart -- and by orientalist, I mean that the nature of the video's virulence creates a sense of ""us"" and ""them.""

This type of thinking is bad. Yes, it generates a mass public call for some sort of recourse, but the framework of thinking about activism and how to participate in activism is wrong. The response (mostly from our generation) has demonstrated how, pursuant to this type of ""crowd sourced"" news, is a type of activism that is anything but ""active."" We have millions of people talking about the issue now -- but the conversation is empty. This may seem counter intuitive, but BECAUSE everyone is talking about Kony, discussions surrounding what we can do about it LOSE MEANING.

The viral nature of the information has had a positive effect on awareness, but has ADVERSELY effected our ways of thinking in regards to EFFECTIVE participation in activism --- and to me, seems like passion without content. If we want to create meaningful change, we first need meaningful activism, which demands meaningful activists. Awareness means nothing if it's spread thinly with no organization. Individuality and the power of individual action has been overplayed and overestimated in this country. We forget the meaning of collective action.

While it may seem contrary to logic, collective action is NOT about a million or so people complaining to politicians so they'll send another one, two, three, or four delegates to ""assess the situation,"" which ONLY serves to satisfy the public and garner favor from voters. Collective action is about instituting meaningful change that is INCREMENTAL. We have to start from the BOTTOM-UP, and not the other way around (this being Top-Down activism; which has been the typical activist-response to this type of internet activism) because Top-Down activism DOES NOT carry the momentum of meaningful and lasting political pressure.

Collective action is about plurality -- that many groups, driven by a unifying cause, can produce many small changes (stepping stones!) relative to their respective locations; that these changes will travel throughout systems of power (through the momentum generated and maintained by MEANINGFUL activists!) until they reach the top of the pyramid. No matter how hard we want to believe otherwise, the levels of EFFECTIVE activism are limited by the structures of power to which they must negotiate OR depose. Even in cases where the activism is about deposing systems of power, the successes are limited by how these systems are replaced,as is the current situation in Egypt.

So, I'll just say it again ---- the type of activism generated by this video has been about: a.) commercial activism, and b.) information spreading. Activism, yes --- but actually ""active""? No.

All I'm saying is, the level of political activism generated by the video has little meaning. Awareness is NOT activism. Once people are aware, there must follow organization, coordination, and above all else WORK, work, and MORE work. The Kony video does LITTLE to produce or inspire individuals who can and will dedicate real time and efforts into meaningful activism -- rather, it generates a mass of sheeple, albeit for a worthy cause, but none the less, sheeple. The video educates and angers people, but in the end, also undermines the possibility of effective change.

This is just my critical analysis, which started as a simple discomfort of the video, and my exploration of why i was so discomforted by it. I wish I could propose an alternative, but the problem is much larger. It's inherently connected to the recent surge of global activism, which has taught us that if we want something to happen, get out of the armchair. Knowing this, we can't with good conscience promote this kind of lazy activism.

**TLDR version;**

My problem with the Kony video is that it is counter-intuitive -- it has generated a massive discussion concerning Kony, but much of the discussion is empty and promotes new forms of activism that are MEANINGLESS. These forms of activism have the potential to DETRACT from their respective movements, rather than aid their growth. Why? Because rather than give these social movements meaningful staying power and producing for these movements REAL activists who will do REAL work, these forms of viral, crowd-sourced activism turn their respective causes, like that of the Kony video, into tomorrow's ""old news.""",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,"Concerning our generation's response to the Kony 2012 video -- what it really means, and how meaningful activism is hurt by it",http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/r0myu/concerning_our_generations_response_to_the_kony/,1290854378.0,t2_4k7li,1.0,2010

At first they merely denied the change in culture that Smith stressed, one from nurturing a relationship with their clients to field-stripping their clients for as much money as they could get. But now they’re bringing out the big guns.

    A Goldman official confirmed that Mr. Smith, who worked for the Wall Street firm for nearly 12 years, most recently in London, resigned from Goldman this morning [...]

    Mr. Smith described himself as an executive director and head of Goldman’s U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

    A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Smith’s role is actually vice president, a relatively junior position held by thousands of Goldman employees around the world. And Mr. Smith is the only employee in the derivatives business that he heads, this person said.

So he only had a fake title, is the claim. He wasn’t in a position to know anything. He was isolated over there in London.

Forbes chalked it up to a midlife crisis. Other employees blabbed to Charlie Gasparino that Smith was a small-timer, never making more than $750,000 a year. And the financial press on cable TV went on an all-out attack.

This sounds like a last gasp to me. Matt Taibbi’s excellent piece makes the point that Wall Street was always going to have to reform itself, when the clients stood up for themselves rather than continually handing over money to firms committed to ripping them off. If Goldman wants to shift from a client relations firm to a trading firm, fine. But clients should know that, and they should direct their money accordingly. I don’t know if we’re even at the point now where reputational risk can sink a Wall Street firm, but this is the best shot:

No one can touch them, and sadly, most of the biggest institutional clients see getting clipped for a few points by Goldman or Chase as the cost of doing business.

    The only way to break this cycle, since our government doesn’t seem to want to end its habit of financially supporting fraud-committing, repeat-offending, client-fleecing banks, is for these big “muppet” clients to start taking their business elsewhere.

The blowback, in my view, is a glancing blow that reinforces the fact that Smith has a real point here. The question is whether the investors will recognize this as well.

…from a policy standpoint, Bartlett Naylor of Public Citizen ties Smith’s op-ed to the Volcker rule:

    Explosive revelations today from an outgoing Goldman Sachs executive emphasize the need for Wall Street agencies to finalize the Volcker Rule reform, which would prevent many significant conflicts of interest in the financial industry [...]

    The Volcker Rule, approved as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, prohibits banks from engaging in trades for their own profits and strictly bars trading that conflicts with customers’ interests. But a barrage of self-serving industry comments have led regulators to signal they will delay implementation beyond the statutory deadline of July 2012. Goldman Sachs submitted two comment letters and met with regulators personally an unprecedented six times. Regulators should put Smith’s candid and brave words on the top of any analysis about how best to reform Wall Street and weigh them when considering the motivations behind Goldman’s official comments and meetings.

After all, Smith’s op-ed, at the root, describes massive conflicts of interests between Goldman and its clients.

Some people are actually calling him brave, which bothers me. One, he stayed for 12 years while all of this has been going down. He's set for life, will probably get a nice book deal out of this, and has done wonders to spread the word regarding his new firm. That's not what's really eating at me, though.

The problem as I see it, is that every large company in this country is amoral to an extent, and I would wager that many, if not most of them are as rotten to the core as GS. Stop and think for a moment about your job, and your company. Think about how they treat you. If you're currently a middle class, white collar worker, consider yourself lucky because you probably aren't getting the brunt of cruelty that corporations can dish out. If you're somewhere below that, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. 

My Story:

I lost my web design job 3 years ago when the economy tanked. At the time, the best I could do was find a job installing cable as an ""independent"" contractor. The first year of that wasn't too bad. The second year, the company that I contracted for began implementing policy changes. At first, the changes happened every couple of months, then every month, then every other week, then every week, then almost daily they were tweaking the rules. 

On the surface it doesn't sound so bad, but you have to understand the context to understand why it was a problem. First, being an independent contractor means you get paid by the job. You get no benefits, no overtime pay, your work hours are not regulated, and you pay for your own tools, insurance, taxes, etc.  

The first major change added about 5 minutes to every job we had to do. At roughly 8 jobs a day, that's another 40 minutes we had to work every day to make the same pay that we were previously making. The trend continued over several months. 2 minutes here 4 minutes there, until I was spending an extra 40 minutes or so on every job. When it turned out that we weren't going to be able to do as many jobs per day, they solved it by expanding the timeframes. Basically, we were still making the same money and working an extra 3-4 hours every day. The last guy out usually didn't close his final order till about 10PM, and sometimes worked as late as midnight. 

I suddenly found myself facing the possibility of working 7am till midnight every day I worked. I should mention that they don't schedule lunches or breaks between timeframes. The only way you got those is if you were running ahead of schedule, or had a job cancel. I also forgot to mention that cable contractors are expected to work 6 days a week. Walking through the door each morning was like playing worker's roulette.

This was a gradual change, and it was done deliberately so we'd take it in small doses. Presumably so there wouldn't be some type of worker exodus. 

At the same time all of the work changes were being implemented, other things were going on that were eroding our rights, and lowering our pay. I can recount precise instances of not getting paid for jobs, sitting unpaid for hours because of cancelled jobs and routing gaps, being constantly derided by the ""power structure,"" awful work conditions, safety hazards. This has already become quite lengthy, so I won't get into details.

My point is this: There are millions of us going into work every day into hostile environments. Americans are going to work and their health and well being is threatened just by showing up. Corporate structures are amoral systems designed to chase numbers and return profits. They don't care about the people on whose backs they sit because they are designed not to care, only to profit. You are a means to an end, a number on a page and a spoke on a wheel. And they evolve over time. Policies are changed, rights and benefits and pay are slashed to evolve them into more efficient profit generating structures. Profit prioritized evolution, makes them more corrupt and more out of line with human decency over time.

I tried to get everyone to stand up for themselves, but nobody would. Every single person I worked with felt their only option was to take it and keep working. After enduring 3 years of a perpetually eroding work environment, I quit. I have no parachute and no book deal in the wings, so don't expect to read about me in the New York Times.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,default,Some things I need to say.,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/qz2e0/some_things_i_need_to_say/,,,1.0,2010

There are a lot of opinions and I don’t mean to simplify too much, but I have broken down the most popular criticisms below into several categories.

Bandwagon Critique: This criticism boils down to the fact that this has become very popular and there is a hive-mind mentality and people are supporting the cause and don’t really understand the issue. I agree with this on one level but also recognize that people should be able to use popular means to raise awareness and money for a cause. Example: Bono can hold a concert to raise money to fight AIDS in Africa. Even if 95% of the people who attend don’t care at all about the issue, when the concert’s over, Bono still raises a ton of money to fight AIDS in Africa. That’s good even if it is a bandwagon.

Irony Critique: Some people have said that they think the “Kony 2012” logo is disrespectful. It has been likened to having a “Bin-Laden 9-11” campaign. While I agree that this kind of irony can be disrespectful in certain contexts (especially in Uganda), in the US, I would say you would have a hard time understanding popular culture without recognizing the power of irony. Historical example: Jonathan Swift wrote A Modest Proposal about eating babies to bring attention to the poverty in Ireland. I love irony.

Emotional Critique: The video plays on our emotions. Yes, it does. But is that, in itself, bad? When Fox News uses unfounded claims to appeal to the fear of its viewers, that is bad. But, when my Driver’s Ed instructor showed the class a slide show of people horribly mauled in a car accident to appeal to ours fears and encourage us to be safe drivers, it certainly made me more cautious. It is ok to appeal to people’s emotions, if the cause is important and well founded. In the Kony 2012 video they appeal to our emotions by showing that this little America child doesn’t have to worry about a Warlord, but in another country little kids his age might have to. This appeals to our compassion for people we don’t know. If you feel it, good. If you don’t, you might have a keen since of skepticism, good. But appealing to emotions in itself isn't wrong.

Other Importance Critique: Why do people care about this and not some other issue? Perhaps you care about something you think is more important and are pissed that this guy made a video and now all kinds of people think that this is an issue that should be addressed. If you feel another issue should have this kind of awareness, do something to make people more aware. For goodness sakes, don't berate people for bringing injustice to our attention.

The critiques above are easy to make and easy to refute. Here are some of the real critiques of this video we should be asking.

(1) The video claims that the US should send troops to remove Joseph Kony. Should the United States do that? If we step in a take someone out, how have we empowered the people to keep others like him from rising up? We armed the Taliban to fight the Russians and then left the area with a militant military force that was almost entirely unchecked… yada yada yada… 9-11. We also don’t have a good record of military successes in rural areas. I’m thinking in this case of Afganistan and Vietnam. Both have been seen as failures in many ways. 

(2) What happens after Joseph Kony is removed? The video makes it seem as though it will be sunshine and rainbows when he’s gone, but it doesn’t address any of the reasons a person like him could rule for so long in the area. There are still major issues, of poverty, religion and tribal politics that make this area the kind of place where this sort of thing could happen. If Joseph Kony is removed, that doesn’t address any of the underlying issues. What will stop another person from picking up where he left off?

To be honest (and I understand this is not the view of most people on the internet, so bear with me), I think the government SHOULD have this right. There really are some decisions the government has to decide and some things the government has to do that are not necessarily ""on par"" with what the general public wants to do. When that withheld information gets released, there's an uproar because people say ""Well we should have known about this stuff! We have a right to know!""... While lots of people can understand the reasons for withholding sensitive information, there are also lots of people who will take the information the wrong way and simply *look at the fact that they were hiding it as a reason to say the government was doing something wrong*, even if the information withheld wasn't incriminating in any way. To me, that seems unnecessary.

Rick Santorum won the Alabama and Mississippi primaries despite  Newt Gingrich splitting the hard conservative vote. Mitt Romney won Hawaii and the Samoan Islands, which combined with a close race in Alabama and Mississippi actually gave him more delegates on Tuesday than Santorum. However, so much of politics is perception, so Rick Santorum will be able to ride a wave of renewed questions about the weaknesses of Mitt Romney as a front runner.

Newt Gingrich has vowed to stay in the race, but it's creating an interesting dynamic. Mr. Adelson, the Casino billionaire who has been keeping Newt Gingrich afloat, may be doing so not because he believes Newt can win, but because he doesn't want Santorum to win. The theory is that Adelson wanted Gingrich to win, but when it became obvious he wouldn't, he decided that Romney had the better chance to beat Obama. Rather than flip his support to Romney, he simply continues to fund Newt Gingrich so he can maintain his friendship and undermine Santorum. 

At this point Gingrich has no path forward, and has only three possible roles left:

* He can either stubbornly stay in the race, acting as spoiler for Santorum and assuring a Romney victory.

* He can stay in the race, but slow down his campaign and let Santorum win. Then if it comes down to a contested convention he can act as king maker

* He can drop now, endorse Santorum, at whatever price he thinks he can weedle out of Santorum (possibly a VP spot).

Santorum wins the momentum, but not the delegates he need. Certainly he's happy with this win as it was nearly requried for him to be considered a serious contender, but Newt Gingrich stopped him from getting a blow out victory needed to close in on Romney's delegate count. Santorum is desperate to see Gingrich leave the race as it's the only way Santorum could win the GOP Primary without a contested contest. Truthfully, I don't believe Gingrich will drop out, and will hang like an albatross around Santorums neck. This will leave his best chance to be a contested convention.

Romney's math is adding up, but everything else is going wrong. He has a near insurmountable lead in delegates, but the perception of his campaign is horrible right now. He probably could win the nomination just by sitting back and winning delegates in the more liberal states. However, if he's going to look like a strong nominee he has to find a way to shake Santorum. The most frustrating part for him must be that he has no way to attack Santorum. Any of Santorums more hard core conservative comments will be great fuel in the general election, but in a GOP primary in today's environment it's worthless to Romney. So he's left with math, which will make him the winner but leave a bitter taste in the GOP's mouth.


If I had to predict the end of this contest, I'd say it's Romney winning, but with Santorum as VP. It's the only way to get rid of the bitter feelings the conservative core of the GOP has towards him. Even then it might not be enough. A moderate presidential candidate with a conservative VP candidate didn't do too well 4 years ago. And Santorum has the potential to make just as many emberassing gaffes as Palin did.

* Promotion of abortion and birth control (Women's rights)

* According to the Bill of Rights, the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is a civil and individual right
* (In the USA) Gun control has a history rooted in racism to prevent immigrants and blacks from being armed (See Sullivan Act in NYC) and leaving them to be preyed upon by the KKK and other racist elements http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_Act
* Banning guns (like banning drugs and alcohol) only keeps the law-abiding from owning/using guns, and pushes such things into the black market and use by the criminal elements of society.  This argument is also used in the case of **legalizing** drugs too.
* In some nations where guns were banned, gun crime has actually increased (the UK for example)
* In the USA, gun crime and overall crime has been in decline, despite the fact that gun laws have been increasingly liberalized (41 states allow concealed carry of firearms, most states also allow the purchase of suppressors/silencers, machine guns, and other weapons).  This isn't intended to show that guns = less crime, but it's intended to show that greater accessibility to firearms has no positive impact on crime 
* Vast majority of police agree that civilians should be armed, and that their being armed is helpful to keeping crime low. http://www.nacoponline.org/23rd.pdf
* Guns offer protection to the weak and outnumbered.  They can equalize the difference between an 80 year old man and a 20 year old, a woman versus her abusive ex-husband, or a 25 year old versus a group of people meaning to do harm.

I was volunteering at a Wounded Warriors event and this man (former veteran) was telling a story of how he had his sons welcome home the troops at an event as thanks, since they had not served in the armed forces. I understand the reason but feel uncomfortable because I think we (the general civilian Americans) do it too often out of a patriotic learned response.  This is where I might be wrong and looking for help on this issue

My grandparents were in WWII, my dad in Vietnam, I was of the first generation to be able to choose to enlist. I chose not to because, although unlikely, I may have to take a life and that was something I was not sure I could live with.  I think those who serve are actually owed more than what our society gives them. If you are willing to put your life on the line we should pay for medical for life, aid more in your education, etc. When Bush was in office and a story got out the armed forces had insufficient body armor, I thought, tax my paycheck to pay for it. Actually since close to 75% of the U.S. budget is on Defense I don’t understand why all troops are not taken care of better. 

My issue is that the public is told you have freedoms because of the troops. I think during WWII it was easier to see evil. Today’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq seem to be fought for political reasons and a growing American Empire. I’m not saying we are not doing some good or that terrorists are right, just that the world has a lot of grey.  I am certainly not saying don’t thank the troops because we are in an unjust war. Soldiers are doing their job and should never be treated as they were after Vietnam. I am just afraid of perpetuating the wrong message.

 If I thank you, the message seems to be because I approve of what we’re doing ,and I don’t. I think American civilians failed our soldiers by not fighting enough to find real solutions before we go to war. I feel guilty for not doing enough and letting someone join the service and die. I’ve seen young kids enthralled with the idea of going into action, fighting for freedom, and joining because of Patriotism. In reality, they can come back damaged because war is horrible. It is a horrible thing to live through but I’m supposed to bite my tongue and just say Thank You for your service. (Which I do though) Just saying what I am saying the majority of people would say you’re a disgusting liberal, but I’m trying to make a point. Or do I have one? Am I asking the wrong question? Am I not seeing something?

First, the entire premise that ACA is unconstitutional is based on the idea that is a violation of the founding document to ""mandate"" that citizens purchase a product.  That being the case, and ACA overturn effectively ends any conservative effort to ""reform"" Social Security by turning it into private investment accounts.  If it is unconstitutional to make citizens by health insurance, then it is surely unconstitutional to make them put money into retirement accounts.  Any attempts to attack Social Security would need to be aimed at directly repealing a very popular program.  Not likely.  So in effect, and ACA reversal at SCOTUS effectively protects social security from attack.

Second, a reversal makes a single payor health care system in the United States not just more likely, but inevitable.  If you want a privately run health insurance system in any population, there are only two ways to make a profit.  One -- the current system, which effectively screens out and denies coverage for the sick in order to maintain a profit, or, two, you mandate coverage for all so that there is enough participation in the program to enable full coverage and profitability for the private sector.

An ACA overturn effectively returns us to a status quo where tens of millions cannot access affordable health care.  Only with the new constitutional guidelines handed down by SCOUTS, there will effectively be only one feasible policy remedy -- increasing Federal taxes for Medicare, and allowing anyone in the population to enroll.  

Politics is often about the unintended consequences.  The individual mandate was originally a Republican/Conservative idea.  By fighting it so fiercely now, conservatives are not only going to take full ownership of a broken US Health Care Delivery system, but they are rigging the playing field so that the eventual remedies will ultimately be far more liberal than they had ever dreamed.",PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,self,The upside of a potential ACA Repeal for Progressives,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/rhlhp/the_upside_of_a_potential_aca_repeal_for/,1326255417.0,t2_6mvtr,,2010

I am also in my 20s and am concerned with what I perceive to be young Americans (18 to 34 year olds) voting AGAINST their own interests by supporting liberal candidates and/or causes.  To be fair, you could easily make the argument that conservative policies (particularly social policies) can potentially be harmful to this same demographic, but for the sake of this post, let's stick to economics and save the anti-conservative arguments for another place.  I genuinely would like to know how young liberals rationalize these conflicts (and if they are perceived to be conflicts in the first place).

I believe the following tendencies of liberal and/or Democratic elected officials go against the interests of younger voters:

- Supporting the status quo of Medicare: It's been widely discussed how Medicare will be insolvent in nearly a decade.  If you look at the math, it's just fiscally unsustainable.    Starting in 2009-2010, for the first time, the Federal government began paying out more in Medicare than it began taking in as the first wave of Baby Boomers began to turn 65.  This of course may be a generalization, but Republicans have historically made Medicare reform an issue while being attacked by Democrats over it (see the Dems' reaction to the Ryan Plan as the most recent example). Considering Democrats continually pander to elderly voters (read: the AARP) and also that we young Americans are paying for a program not guaranteed to be there when it's our time to collect, wouldn't it be in our own best interest to at least take a stand against politicians that vote to protect the status quo of Medicare?

- Increasing Debt/Deficit Spending: I agree that Republicans are just as guilty as Democrats in the spending department and considering Bush spent trillions on a war in Iraq while borrowing from China, having an R next to his name doesn't absolve him from contributing to our nation's spending problem.  However, during his time as President, Obama has significantly accelerated our nation's debt and deficit through costly programs such as the stimulus, auto bailouts and misguided loan guarantees to companies like Solyndra.  Simply put, Democrats advocate for big government programs that result in massive, costly entitlements (i.e. the Affordable Care Act).  My question is this: why should anyone under the age of 34 support people/policies that will benefit only certain segments of society today while forcing our generation to pay for it (with interest)?

- Supporting Pro-Union Policies: I'm specifically referring to policies like Last In, First Out (in education), which penalize qualified employees simply because they are on the lowest rung of the professional org chart.  Also, granting tenure to undeserving employees in any profession prevents new blood from entering an office place. I'm intrigued by unions and believe (but have not seen any data) that they are generational and not necessarily as popular or perceived as necessary among younger Americans as they are among workers from another generation.

I don't want to turn this into a post bashing conservatives (or liberals, for that matter).

We destroy our defense budget.  We abolish or essentially abolish the Marine Corps, dismantle a large majority of the army (+80%), and end the military industrial complex.  By that, I mean we hire the 'brains' of the MI complex for 1.5x what they were making, train some of our ex-soldiers (the smarter ones willing to stay on) how to work to produce military gear for the same pay they were making before, + housing expenses (and they get manufacturing and engineering expertise) and essentially turn the military industrial complex into a more efficient 'department of the military'.

This would cut our military budget literally in half (by approx. $350B a year) based on rough wikipedia estimates.  This money would then be used elsewhere.  Some of it, maybe $50B would be invested BACK into the millitary.  Smartly.  In highly trained special forces units, precise aerial units (drones, fighters/bombers) and a small portion to the navy.  America needs to address real threats to it's security.  Not invade and occupy countries.  We can do that much better by destroying the shit out of the specific people threatening us, and leave enough alone.

This added investment into the AirForce, Navy, and Army Rangers would in turn produce new consumer technologies more quickly (military research is the best research), and STRENGTHEN America's overall military power, while cutting costs.

Most of this extra money however would go to education.  Which I would change radically.  First off, I would end the student loan system.  Done.  It's a disaster.  I would expand the budgets of ALL public schools everywhere, drastically.  Teacher student ratio 1:15 MAXIMUM throughout the country for ages 5-18.  However, I think my next step is what would create the most controversy.  I would abolish all community, and non-flagship state colleges.  Instead, I would use their land and resources to house 'high school students' for grades '13 and 14'.  That's right, extend high school to age 20.  Minimum drop out age 21.  Maximum Teacher student ratio 1:30  You have to finish high school - including 2 years of what used to be called college - and its all free, paid for by the state.  After you graduate, you are eligible to apply for a job.  Not before.  If you have extenuating circumstances, you can apply for government assistance on a case by case basis, but you FINISH 'high school'.  After High School, the top students in the class can apply to go to their school's still open 'flagship' university for 2 years, free.  After that, they can apply for government grants based on academic performance to continue on to get master's degrees.  At any point in this process, whoever can afford it, can get a scholarship for, or wants to, can attend any private school.  But no one has to.

This results in the US having a FAR more educated population, which solves SO many problems, everywhere.

Taxes are going to change too.  Tax rates, frankly, are retarded.  They SHOULD be calculated the same way the military calculates pay scale - by what you do and where you live.  A doctor living in New York City should pay far less in taxes than a banker living in new york city, who should pay far more taxes than a doctor or a factory worker in Ohio.  All of this 'more/less' nonsense in rates, not dollars.  If you live in a more expensive area, you get taxed less.  If your job produces something tangible, or helps produce something tangible, you get taxed less.  At the same time, we introduce a 'reasonable surtax'.  That is, a 49% surtax on all income above the value of $1M in a set location - say for example Cleveland Ohio.  So in New York City, you can make $2M without paying a higher tax, because your $2M only goes as far as $1M in Cleveland.  At the same time, if you make $500k in 'no where's ville' alabama, you get taxed at 49%, because your 500k goes farther than $1M in Cleveland.  This would have to be constantly adjusted for inflation and deflation, and based on a careful study on what city has exactly the most median COLA index in the states.  There are no loopholes.  No adjustments for different kinds of income.  The money you would be taking home, no matter where it's from, determines your taxes. Exemptions are going to start from scratch.  For example, no more religious exemptions (the church, as well as Synagogues and Mosques and all other religious institutions, are going to pay taxes).  No more capital gains exemptions.  No more sillyness.  Cost of living/how much you make.

Back to spending.  A lot of that $350B is gone.  But not all of it.  Whats left can be used to

- Double the NASA and DARPA budgets

- Refurbish the US National Highway System

- Build High Speed Rail along all major US corridors

We can also abolish some useless organizations.  The TSA comes to mind.  As does our VAST intelligence spread.  There is no reason NOT to consolidate all of our intelligence agencies into one, and all of our national police (FBI, ATF, DEA) into one national police force.

Speaking of the DEA  - they're going to be largely abolished as well.  As all drugs are going to be legal - as long as they're grown in America.  Distribution will be strictly regulated, and import/export banned.  No Heroin from the Taliban.  No Weed from Mexican Cartels.  No Cocaine from Columbia.  If you can figure out how to make it in the US, and you get loose government approval/inspection to make sure it's not pure poison, anyone over the age of 18 can legally buy it.  This goes for alcohol as well.  18.

All religious based laws are scrapped.  It is against our constitution to mix religion and state.  Abortion is legal.  Shops can be open whenever they want to be (some places, being open or selling certain things on Sunday is illegal because Sunday is 'the day of rest').

You have the right to bear arms.  That means guns - as in, defend yourself guns.  As in, 50 caliber bullets and weapons can't be civilian owned unless you can prove that you meet high need standards. They will only be offered in places where such standards can be met.  For example, if you live in Alaska, an 800lb grizzly bear might break into your house.  You can't use a .22 for that.  (Happened to a friend of my fathers).  If you live in new york city, there is no way in hell you need a 50 caliber weapon.  Our founding fathers did not intend for us to own Barret 50 cals that can shoot down planes when they said right to bear arms.  That's different.

Citizenship is also going to be different.  We are unique from the rest of the world.  In a bad way.  We are the only country that taxes it's citizens abroad.  If I decide I don't like the states, and move to Canada, I don't want to be imprisoned when I come back for not paying US taxes in addition to my canadian taxes.  Fuck that.  No other country does that.  You also don't get birthright citizenship.  If you can't pass a basic exam which all the material will be taught for before your 10, such as 'how many branches are there in government', 'who is the current US president'  'how many senators are there', and you don't have special exemption (for example, you have a severe learning disability)  you don't get citizenship.

Health insurance is going to change.  A lot.  There will not be government insurance.  There will not be extensive government intervention in the insurance industry.  Because doctors are going to have pay caps, determined by the skill needed for their job, years they spent being educated for it, and their COLA index score (Cost of Living Adjustment).  Tests are going to be at cost - by law.  When you get an MRI, you pay 1/10,000 the cost of the machine (assuming it gets 10k uses in it's lifetime) plus the cost of the electricity, and the cost to pay the technicians to run it and process your results.  No longer will simple tests be profit machines.  This will bring insurance rates down drastically, without doubt.

Robert Murdoch bought the WSJ in 2007. The editorial section of the WSJ has turned into Fox News, the print edition.

The author of this op/ed is Mr. Happer, a professor at Princeton.  If you dig a little deeper you find that Mr. Happer is a member of the conservative think tank the Cato Institute.

If you dig just a little deeper you find out that the Cato Institute was created by Charles Koch, one of the 2 Koch brothers who are billionaire owners of one of the biggest oil refining/distributing companies in the world.

The penalty for failing to have insurance has been described as a tax because of how it is paid. Congressional powers of taxation are the rationale behind the constitutionality of Social Security and Medicare; how does ACA differ from those programs?

One distinction between ACA and Social Security pointed out by its opponents is that ACA involves forcing one private party to give money to another, in contrast to Social Security, which forces citizens to give to the government; is this a meaningful distinction or is it (to borrow a phrase) a distinction without a difference?

President Obama said that Martin could ""look like"" his son, had he a son. Or if one of his daughters were transexual, I guess. The business of ""looking"", appearances, is having a lot of play here: looking like. Martin looked like someone in a hoodie, maybe a trouble maker, a lot of whom wear hoodies.

Zimmerman looked like *something* to Martin. He inquired, ""What are you doing here?"" to Martin. How did Martin interpret this? Or did he? Or, on the contrary, did he ignore this and begin to *make a case* in his mind that this man was a potential attacker, in the way that Zimmerman may have, or pretty clearly was, making the case in his mind that Martin was a potential robber/troublemaker in the gated community.

Excessive ""making out"" of appearances and *prima facies* I call ""flarings"". Was Zimmerman flaring on Martin? Bear in mind that Zimmerman called this in in the first place to 911. This is not the same as a simple racially motivated killer trying to kill a black. Most likely. On the contrary, he was self-identified accurately and on 911 tape, which he knew would be the case. True, he was told not to pursue Martin, but this is not an order from a 911 operator. It was Zimmerman's neighborhood.

Martin had a nice smile. Should we make all copy referring to Martin read, ""Martin, who has a nice smile""? Can we really tell from the pictures of Martin, who had a nice smile, that he wouldn't or couldn't have attacked Zimmerman? It was Martin who was screaming, says is family. That's a pretty hefty thing to challenge or question and it is, indeed, a very important issue. The may well be right, and Zimmerman may well have simply jumped Martin. But Zimmerman may have a bit of a falsetto scream in a crisis.

Is it really the case that Martin, who had a nice smile, could not have attacked Zimmerman based on the fact that Zimmerman weighed 80 pounds more than Martin?

Martin was black. Perhaps Zimmerman was on guard about, specifically, blacks in the neighborhood. This is linked entirely, on the part of protesters, with racism. Is it linked with the racism inherent in black culture, the ""profiling"" by which admission in to the group, ""blacks among blacks"", is accomplished? Should I trot out the incredibly high crime rates, taken from the crude angle of race, for blacks in America? 

We know that Zimmerman was not worried about Dan Rather going through the neighborhood, to paraphrase Chris Rock. But we can imagine pretty easily that he was worried about blacks. And he may have said something about a ""coon"" in the tapes, which is a racist word indeed. But we *don't* know that. There is every reason to imagine that, were he to have come upon a white person with the same other features, in a hoodie, he may well have been just as suspecting. 

Would a white -- or any other -- person have responded more definitively or in an illuminating fashion were Zimmerman to have said, ""What are you doing here?"" Had Martin said, ""I live right down the way, I was going to the store"", what would this have meant in the circumstance?

Did Martin have a (potentially justified) chip on his shoulder, such that he was not inclined to illuminate by communicating his reason for being there?

Or did Martin's lack of communication and trying to sort out, present himself communicatively, explain what he was doing, etc., issue from *something*, and what might that *something* have been? 

It is entirely possible that Martin's non-communication in this regard associates with a style of communication that itself is intimately connected with the problems of black culture that are involved with the heightened levels of violence within black culture. In other words, a communicative style that is characterized by failure to work things out verbally. Furthermore, was Martin, who had resolved not to run from this pursuer, inclined *not* to explain, out of an angry reaction, thereby preserving an imagine of righteous indignation, the which went on to support his *possible* decision to turn on Zimmerman and attack him?

Yet, we are told, it had to be Zimmerman who attacked Martin, who had a nice smile. Zimmerman, who had made some 40 or more calls to 911 in the past, someone who was ""one of those people who see a crime around every corner"". Well, isn't seeing a crime around every corner the job of someone on a neighborhood watch?

Zimmerman was carrying a gun. This looks to me to be pretty questionable. On the other hand, what is the kind of crime that surrounds the area? Yet, he pursued, like a cop, someone, and he did so alone, without the kind of backup or training a police officer has. This strikes me as quite foolish, bordering on incompetent. Yet it should be noted just how many blacks carry guns, and just how many are illegal. And many whites as well, to be sure. And yet, when one of *those* guns goes off in any way that is not appropriately self-defense -- and it is not clear yet that this situation was in fact not self-defense and appropriately standing one's ground -- we do not witness this kind of fire storm. 

This may indeed have been a very unjust murder. It may not have. Calls for investigation are appropriate. But the general contour or profile, if I may use that word here, of those protesting this issue strikes me as highly problematic and continues to bespeak a general bankruptcy of the Left in a number of basic ways. This reaction(ism) is a fairly typical leftist drilling operation. I say this as a very hard core ""leftist"", but in what I would like to think is a best sense of the term: in favor of real progress at every level. But I also say this as a self-proclaimed ""post-postmodernist"", something that has, in the main, yet to dawn on people or be adequately defined, except by, apparently, me. Yet, I suggest, little is more needful than this. 

Part of this ""postpostmodern"" take on things is drawing left reactions and positions, what I often call ""drilling operations"" into question. Such a question is a *suspicion* regarding the narratives and operations of the Left that is itself simply basic postmodern suspicion. What makes it postpostmodern is where I go with it. But it seems to me that the postmodern aspect of this, the query and refusal to buy the Left narrative in particular is the postmodern gesture *par excellence*. The standard postmodern gesture is, of course, suspicion of the great, central momenta, trajectories, narratives, glorifications, etc., usually touted and above all believed rather naively by the right. 

Postpostmodernism as such is founded on *thought*, a though that is, I suggest, deeply wanting in the entrenched operations of the Left.

We witness in the Martin (who had a nice smile)/Zimmerman (who weighted 80 pounds more than Martin) case the flexing of these usual muscles and the setting up of the usual drilling operations that are based on the ongoing *spin* of events and circumstances into this turning of the bit to drill for the only oil it has any interest in finding: that Zimmerman was a racist, that racisms is an *oppression*, that that is to countered and more than anything else, that *that is all*.

I already know *why* people want them to end (""rich should pay their 'fair share'"", ""they can afford it"", etc, etc...), so don't tell me that. 

Ending the Bush Tax cuts for income earners over $200,000 is projected to bring us about $700 billion in additional revenue over the next ten years. A serious chunk of cash, no doubt, but people seem to be forgetting the other 80% of the Bush tax cuts going to everyone else. If these tax cuts were ended, would bring us an additional $3 **trillion** in revenue in the next decade.

So, if we have a revenue problem (like so many opponents of the Bush tax cuts seem to think) then why aren't we looking to end the tax cuts for the middle and lower class as well? Why are we also just fine and dandy with extending the payroll tax cut that added an additional $100 billion to our deficit this year alone? And why are we still looking at a national debt just under $20 trillion by 2022 even if we *do* end all these tax cuts???

Admittedly, I was arguing some of my points rather hastily and some of what I said does not accurately portray my positions on the issues that have been presented.

I apologize to anyone I may have offended because, again, I truly am a supporter of woman's rights. Beyond that, I am a supporter of equal rights for *all* and tried to portray that here, but obviously there are situations where that is not only impossible, but to attempt to realize it would only serve to make the situation worse than when it began; this is one of those situations. I promise, I'm not a bad guy, I just made an immature conclusion about this issue and I honestly have changed my mind. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been a lot of controversy lately over Alaska Representative Alan Dick's support for a law forcing women to get signed consent from the biological father before being able to obtain an abortion. 

Now, I am a democratic socialist, I align very heavily with liberal ideologies and I support women's rights 100%, however, I believe this issue transcends women's rights. Why should it be the sole decision of the woman to decide whether or not to keep the baby? Obviously it would be a burden for the woman because she is the one that must carry the child until delivery, but this is merely a random act of nature; I don't believe it should have any bearing on whether it is right to abort a baby for whom there is a willing parent. If the father wants to raise his child, how is it right for the would-be mother to take that child away from him?

Keep in mind I am speaking solely of cases of a pregnancy resulting from consensual sex and when the father is a willing parent, but the mother is not. 

**tl;dr:** Why should a willing and wanting father be robbed of his child simply because he is not biologically capable of carrying the child himself?

EDIT: Many people are saying that the mother should have the final say because she is made to bear the medical burden of carrying it, and the pregnancy may compromise her job and other significant aspects of her life. My response to this is that the medical component is not entirely relevant since the father had no say in who gets to carry the child. Also, in cases of consensual sex, the mother knew the risks of pregnancy prior to engaging in intercourse and to play the blame game afterwards is unfair. Accidents happen, but if that accidents results in a fetus that belongs to *both a mother and a father*, the father should have equal say in it's development. Also, the prospect of having a child equally impacts the father's professional life and life in general, especially if he was to be a single parent as in cases relevant to this discussion, so to say that the pregnancy only affects the mother is biased and inaccurate.

An innocent young man was shot down for, apparently, little reason other than the color of his skin.  This was a terrible sort of event which continues to be repeated in the United States and in other parts of the world.  Race-based violence is, unquestionably, one of the most odious aspects of daily life in many places.  If society is to truly advance in any meaningful way... this is something which must be adequately addressed. 

But there is something about this specific case which strikes me as peculiar.  I find it interesting that the highest elected government officials have joined the chorus in calling for justice regarding this incident.  Of all potential cases to capture the imagination, I find this one to be relatively arbitrary in its uniqueness.  Young men of color are being shot down every day in modern America and, as horribly tragic and unfortunate as this particular instance was, it just personally doesn't shock me any more than many other cases.  What is it about this case that's captured the attention of the media and government officials?

When Sean Bell was gunned down by the NYPD on his wedding day it didn't receive this kind of attention.  When Oscar Grant was shot in the back while handcuffed and laying face-down on the ground... I don't remember Obama mentioning it or seeing as much national media attention.  So one can't help but to wonder... if the shooter of Trayvon Martin had been a salaried official of the local police department, does any one really believe the media and the President would be as quick to push this incident to the forefront of the national consciousness?  That certainly wouldn't be in keeping with similar events which regularly transpire.      

While this sad incident involving Trayvon Martin may or may not have been racially motivated, statistical and anecdotal evidence abounds in regard to systemic racist violence occurring under the auspices of official government policy.  Only the most inept, racist, or frightened would fail to acknowledge this.  And while I'm generally inclined to provide more statistical data when writing opinion pieces on such issues, I'd hardly even know where to begin amidst the vast abundance of data in regard to this particular subject.

So... why is there so much official interest and media hype in regard to this particular incident?  For starters... it appears that the shooter may have been a person of color himself.  This would fit a common narrative within this society and makes it more presentable in the minds of the corporate press and the government.  But regardless of whether or not the shooter claims any sort of minority status, the bigger issue may be that he was not an official security agent of the state.  Rather, instead, he was likely just an overzealous neighborhood watchmen.  Despite official agents of the state killing, abusing, and imprisoning people on a regular basis... this incident draws more official condemnation and press attention precisely because it was a wayward citizen and not an official agent of the state.  As I mentioned earlier, I doubt the shooter would be in nearly as much trouble if he had an official badge rather than just community sanction.

Reading this opinion thus far... you might have guessed that I'm not the most right-wing ideologue.  But I think the right may have one issue being raised by this incident which is legitimate.  The event at hand will be used by the government to further restrict the public's right to bear arms and general access to guns.  The state will overlook the incessant violence carried out by its own agents and will highlight this incident as exemplary evidence of why further gun control measures must be taken.  Those right-wing groups who point out that ""if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns"" are, actually, correct in that logic.  And that group of outlaws they mention would very much include government officials, agents of the state, and police forces across this land.      

Conversely, it's flawed logic that leads one to believe that the mere presence of guns in society leads to more gun violence.  This was shown to be erroneous by the documentarian Michael Moore in his film Bowling For Columbine.  The issue isn't guns creating violence, the issue is a corrupt system, through and through, which creates a violent society.  Other nations effectively have as many guns as America, but the United States is the murder capitol of the western industrialized world.  And this has nothing to with Americans being genetically more predisposed to violence.  Rather... the issue is that the government of the United States is one of the most brutal in the world.  From foreign wars to the prison-industrial complex, the U.S. government is undeniably aggressive and violent.  And this is the government which will now try to use this sad incident at hand to further curtail its own constitutional law in limiting public access to means of self-defense.

I doubt the family of Trayvon Martin will read this and, if they do, I want them to know that I am truly sorry for their loss.  And I'm also sorry if this incident is being politicized in any way which they disagree with.  However, for my part, I will not simply allow the government to feign sympathy for their loss while creating even more tragedy for so many other people.  It would be nice if Obama had truly ushered in a less racist manner of life in the United States, but that hasn't happened and doesn't appear to be sincerely on his agenda.  Brown people continue to be killed on a daily basis overseas and more black men are currently imprisoned in the U.S. than were ever enslaved at any point before the Civil War.  This is the modern state of violence and race relations in the United States.

As in ""roots"", every radical will soberly intone. Listening to NPR today and the barbershop panel discussion, one could hear the speakers lining up into the usual positions. In general, the position *de rigueur* is just as one expects. Mostly, it's citing cases of similar police brutality/killings, questions about the ""stand your ground"" law, which even its framers are now reconsidering and, of course, ""the conversation"" most young African Americans, or let me say, for a pointed reason, blacks, have with their parents. As if they even needed to have such a conversation. And the complaints, more than appropriate, about the problem of walking while black, sitting while black, how many times one has been stopped for looking like a suspect, etc. And Obama's weighing in; if he had a son, that son would look like Trayvon. Thus, Obama was speaking ""as a father"", which is how he spoke recently when he weighed in on Rush Limbaughs gaffe about ""sluts"" as well. Yet, did he speak as a father when he threatened sanctions that could, if the history of sanctions in Iraq in recent years may be used as a measure of what the threat sanctions can realistically thought to portend, when he threatened the deaths of 500,000 children in the form of ""diplomiatic"", ""crippling sanctions""? We know, at least, that if he had children, they would not look like Iraqi or Iranian children. 

I'm obviously not against these major stances that regard the killing of Trayvon Martin as highly suspicious and loaded with likely racism. They are necessary. And yet when a *cause celebre* like this comes along, when people man their posts along the trenches, it is precisely there that some of the basic assumptions about how these and other problems are approached needs to be confronted and problematized. Why precisely there? Because, while one may point to other issues, one is already witnessing the major formation of thought as it is deployed into reactions and positions. Because even if alternative issues and approaches may be possible, the very nature of the flow and rush into these positions itself has to be questioned. Because what is at stake is the dominance of a basic regime of understanding, and this dominance is manifested and stabilized, orientated and radically reinaugurated and re-established in the trenches. The time is coming for the trenches to be the site for a kind of radical resistance and questioning. 

Which may not be a very fun thing to do. To raise the issue I want to suggest needs to be raised here -- namely, the critique of black culture from within and withoiut -- is liable to bring on quite an onslaught of reaction, disapprobation and, really, condemnation. But only among some. When it comes to race, there are always the scum waiting to chime in if anyone wishes to take a critical stance regarding blacks. And part of what comes with the territory of this, what suggest may be a new kind of activism, is this strange tendency to rub shoulders with those whom progress has already left behind. 

I term this basic operation ""post-postmodern"". I am taking anti-racism, as a species of anti-oppression, to be pretty much postmodern, even if many who are anti-bigot would not use that term and aren't, aside from some very basic aspects concerning simply the suspicion of an old presumption of white superiority, really very postmodern. Which only makes getting all post-postmodern on this issue all the more difficult. But that difficulty, which adds to the flow of a raging stream against which one is deliberately wading headlong at times, is really grist for the mill of this strange and profoundly intractable problematic. 

That intractability, in turn, is part of the conditions of necessity for the post-postmodern turn. The realization of this post-postmodernity lies precisely in grasping that this situation, with its stances, its old guards, its anti-oppression, its positive stances, its reaction against untimely thought, all work together to constitute a dangerously stable situation. And this perception, even if it is merely a thought, is not nothing. And that is something.

To raise this question: but what about the nearly countless cases of blacks shooting whites, and closer to the issue, what of blacks inadvertently shooting whites in moments of unplanned and hubristic, trigger happy passion, recklessness? But more than that, to want to nearly groan when someone like the president weighs in ""as a parent"", when the usual figures, from Al Sharpton to whatever progressive Leftist you want to mention, starts the usual -- and let me clear, *necessary* -- refrain about racism and bias. No, not to groan to the point of depriving the Trayvon Martin case of the fullest necessary ""seriousness"", as Obama put it, of the new special prosecutor, of a fair trial, and even, potentially, the arrest of Zimmerman, who at the time of this writing is free. 

But to question now, right in the middle of this surge, that is the question and the problem. This is necessary, I suggest, because the *surge*, like a surge by the US military in Iraq, has every tendency to dominate the scene, to reestablish the basic commitments to the usual stances. And there is much in common with the war in Iraq in this general issue. Like the general problem of racism, black on black and black on white violence and racist violence, there is a strange intractability, an ongoing source of glaring, eclipsing immediacies or primacies whose sheer import of mortal gravity and compelling need for unrestricted action, and with little room for thought, has always accomplished the very dominance of the greatest commission of resources and lives to that which has been unleashed in righteous reaction.

So that is why it is necesary not to hold back right in the trenches. This is very much like the logic of pulling out of a war in which, in virtually ever case, the soldiers in the trenches will tell you ""you have to come and see, you have to be there"". Yet, if this blinding light of the immediate, grave present is heeded too much, the war *will never end*. Coming around to this difficult conclusion is part of this issue and part of the reason I am writing this at this time.

I am less concerned with this specific issue (and as I've said, I don't mean to downplay the necessities of dealing with it specifically and well), than I am with identifying and clarifying the general form of this approach, which I term ""post-postmodern"". While it may seem unwieldy and require a bit more thought, I think that careful consideration and witness to the problems of massive historical intractabilities have necessitated it, in roughly this very form.

This is the post-postmodern condition.

Whether it is Republicans who want to send public dollars to private schools, or Democrats who wish to get more funding for public schools. The thing is, the US still remains at the bottom of the pack of industrial nations in terms of testing. What I'd be interested in discussing is what measures have other countries put in place that have resulted in improving educational standards in their countries. 

As a side note I would like to know what you all think are some of the biggest problems with American education. One [interesting talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html) I saw at TED was by the founder of the Khan Academy. He believes that much of the grunt work of schools could be channeled into online video tutorials, and teachers would be seen more as consultants rather than giving the same lecture over and over again. Essentially positing the idea that the entire way we educate students isn't really that relevant anymore. 

There's also the Finnish model which gets a lot of attention. In Finland there are no Private schools. Students aren't separated by ability, and they also have the shortest school days in the world. Even so, Finland currently ranks number 1 in the world in terms of testing scores. The opposite of this model is the number 2 country in the world which is South Korea which relies heavily on testing, memorization, and strict disciplinarian codes. So they are two very different approaches which have both yielded great results.

But the problem is that both of these styles of teaching I believe would be virtually impossible in the US as most parents wouldn't go along with a very strict stressful environment for their kids, and we also aren't going to eliminate private schools in the US either. So we pass measures like No Child Left Behind (which was written by Ted Kennedy by the way, and had wide bipartisan support before it failed and we blamed it all on Bush II).  So what really is feasible to implement on a nationwide level, and why does the richest country in the world have a problem with educating their students, while much poorer countries (ahem India) are running circles around us.

Stalking is not to be taken lightly. You do it at one's own risk. Try stalking a few people from your local Wall-mart, see how long that lasts.





**as Jeffrey Toobin puts it, that “the question at the heart of the case is whether Zimmerman reasonably felt threatened."" I’ve framed it this way, too. It’s hard not to. But as Jeff Chase, a recent University of Connecticut law grad, pointed out to me over email, you can flip the premise and see Martin, not Zimmerman, as the person who was acting in self-defense. Jeff writes: “Trayvon saw someone following him, felt threatened, retreated, was still followed, and then was approached by an armed man who had 100 lbs on him. … Because Zimmerman was acting as an aggressor, Trayvon had the right to defend himself by punching, kicking, tackling, etc. Because Zimmerman was acting as the aggressor, his actions cannot be considered self-defense: you can't initiate and then claim self-defense. The evidence for initiation is there on the 911 tape. ... Why is it that a black man cannot be afraid of a white man who follows and approaches him on a street at night?**

""Walking while black"" is not a crime in America.

For those of you not in the know, here's the skinny:

Ron Paul is planning to win the presidency by taking advantage of the delegate system. He is hoping for a brokered convention where he will be able to steal the other candidate's delegates away from them and secure the nomination *without winning a single state.* It's a very clever plan and, if it works, will probably be remembered in political history for a long time to come.

That said, I think that it is unethical. 

Ron Paul's election strategy is a subversion of the will of the People. He is planning to steal the nomination despite never winning a single state and having the fewest popular votes of any candidate. If he is successful this will be the worst undermining of democracy since George W. Bush stole the election in 2000. I just *can not* see a way that this can be justified.

If Ron Paul can not even get a majority of his own party to support his cause then he should not be their candidate. Anything else is just blatantly ignoring the voice of the electorate and I *can not* support or respect a leader that is not willing to listen to the voice of the People. This kind of delegate manipulation goes against everything that Ron Paul supposedly stands for.

What's worse is that *his supporters are okay with this*. For a group that supposedly values democracy and the Constitution they seem the be perfectly okay with Ron Paul making a mockery of democracy. I guarantee that if the shoe was on the other foot and Romney tried to pull this shit with Ron Paul in the lead, his supporters would be outraged.

For issues regarding unemployment, energy dependence and the massive national debt, would divvying the 50 states into regions of production help streamline recovery and create jobs?

For example: Michigan is already the accepted state for automobile production.

What if we allocated, say, New Mexico to be the ""solar energy"" state. We could create really, really appealing tax incentives for private business to set up shop there. Then, we could allocate a 20x20 square mile section in the White Sands desert to be devoted to the research, development and construction of solar panels. It would still fall under the free market, because private business would be running the show, but the state's representatives could be educated in the respective field, and therefore be a good enough authority to represent the technology, it's needs and ideas in the american government. 

I understand that this would be rife with special interests and lobbying, as well as a bureaucratic nightmare, but really those things already exist and at least it would be focused on things that the country needs, as opposed to just the oil lobby controlling everything.

This would, in my opinion, create jobs, stimulate state economies, and off-set problems relating to each state's production.

Convictions that are wrong are an issue, I won't deny that. But I think if you kill someone, you should die too. I'm not talking about manslaughter. Here are my thoughts.

I got facts from 2 different organizations, both of which are respectable, as well as commonly known.

Amnesty International  (http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts) is an organization that pushes for human rights, one of which is obviously life. They have extensive research on Capital Punishment, and they take it very seriously. But I feel like while they made good points, they were leaving things out. It's simply in the way that they word things. For me, it was easy to see where they were stretching things. They never lied, only stretched. They seemed to spend quite a bit of time on how the death penalty is not a deterrent. Also, the wording seems to me like they are trying to evoke emotion a little too much.

The death penalty information center  (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/) is where amnesty international claims to have gotten some of their facts and figures. This website had no bias. There was no emotional wording. There were only factual statements, charts, and graphs. It was obvious that they had no intention of showing any kind of opinion. The organization has never taken any official position on the Death Penalty, though the media apparently has recognized them as anti-Death Penalty. 

Now, let me get to the interesting things.

 In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court suspended the death penalty. In 1976, the death penalty was federally reinstated. What I found more interesting than the reasons for those things were the murder rates after the reinstatement. The national murder rate rose and stayed above the 1976 rate for every year but 2 until 1995. So, perhaps the death penalty isn't a deterrent. But, the murder rate began to fall very sharply starting in 1995, which intrigues me. What happened around 1995? Well, Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which expanded the death penalty to include 57 more murder related crimes. 57. No wonder the murder rates began to drop nationwide. It looks like it is a deterrent - it just has to be enforced properly.

But, capital punishment is more important than life in prison. This is because of the extra time spent in the courts (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty). 

So, you know what I think. What do you have to say?

So I was reading this article above and began to think of all the religious talk lately, and thought......... Hrmm WWJD indeed, besides be arrested on the spot.

I looked at the story of the Bread and the fishies..... which if you don't know, Jesus preformed a miracle where 7 loves and 7 fishes fed a shit ton of people... so the story goes, or something very similar to it. 


A striking understanding of our country today came from this to me.  If Jesus were to multiply the loves, and fish, he would be arrested for doing so with out permit, and probably fined for not doing so in a state sanctioned and approved kitchen, or storefront...... 

Since he gave them away for free, there would be a tax violation because he made many fish and bread from one without registering such a thing with the local board of commerce. Possibly arrested and charged for illegal importation of aquatic life since he would not be able to prove where the fish came from, and also giving a felony charge for copy and distributing the intellectual property of Monsanto which was the grains genetic code that was used to make the first loaf of bread that was multiplied. Really the only miracle here would be if he got out of jail, and didn't have to pay more than a million in fines.. that would be the real miracle. WWJD Indeed...

There's simply not enough evidence. That doesn't mean they are all impossible, however.

I'd also like to point out that many rational people, especially on the left, believe that there is a tendency for people in power to:

* exclude (small competitors, political opponents, etc.)
* self-preserve (advance their own interests)
* conceal (corruption)
* centralize (industry and government)
* and even conspire (price fixing)

I think it must be fair to suppose that there could be small circles of ""the elite of the elite"" who have some agenda that they pursue behind the the curtains of public awareness, and even that there *probably are* such circles. The lessons of history only strengthen this possibility.

SO, purely speculative, can we have a rational discussion about the possibilities? What sort of groups could exist? Who would likely be the key actors? In what ways might they be pushing their agenda? What can be ruled out definitely (i.e. chip implants)?
