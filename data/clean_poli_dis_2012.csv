subreddit,text
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not a fully formed question so I m not exactly sure what you want me to answer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the reply  But what if it s not extremism we re talking about banning What if it s lying Does that change it Should the press have the right to spread propaganda and lie to suit its aims Should it be allowed to change how people feel and think for its own ends Does allowing them to do this create a freer society Or a less free society 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You are a slimy piece of shit you know that   Go back to  r politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok this  net of information of yours includes The Daily Show   I doubt Jon Stewart would recommend people using his show as a legitimate source of information 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did you read the text of this post or just the headline 
PoliticalDiscussion,So because it s written down in the first amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry but I can t agree that there is anything wrong with the title given context 
PoliticalDiscussion,First do you have an IPod  Why don t you sell your computer  Why are you posting here on reddit and not volunteering with the peace corps  I am disinclined to listen to preaching from somebody I have reason to believe isn t practicing it    Secondly the average Reddit user is in the lowest income bracket  Rich by world standards  certainly but turning that wealth into meaningful change is far from simple    Finally there is ample evidence that despite the meagre means of the average redditor acts of generosity are committed on a regular basis  Ascetism is not a solution to poverty changing the economic system is   
PoliticalDiscussion, BILL OF RIGHTS AMENDMENT I   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech   or of the press    or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances   To me all this seems pretty important if we are to call ourselves a free society   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I m a journalist so freedom of the press is something that I really hold dearly to my heart Fox News might have the right to say whatever they wish   but so does everyone else The government can t just pick and choose which viewpoints are permissible and which aren t It s a  marketplace of ideas so to speak Yes I find it disheartening that Fox News is the most popular cable news channel   but so what It might be the most popular  cable news channel but more and more people are going online to get their news That s a good thing because they ll be more likely to be exposed to different ideas and perspectives   I watch Fox News regularly  along with a whole host of other news outlets including CNN MSNBC NPR NYT WSJ The Economist The Atlantic BBC Alternet Al Jazeera and so on    like I said just get your news from a variety of sources and you ll find truth somewhere in the middle  To borrow from John Rawls the famous Harvard political theorist It s better to let extremism  or ill informed political speech for a lack of a better phrase into the public realm When you try to limit it all you do is give it more power 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Bush in an absurdly optimistic hypothetical were convicted of war crimes or of violating the constitution it would set a major precedent It would put fear into any future leaders who think of doing the same Pursuing it sounds pointless when we have someone in office at this very moment do the same if not worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,ITT Liberals downvote things they don t agree with  We  are on Reddit though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would you feel the same if we were talking about Stalin and the question was whether he was committing a massacre Sometimes the extreme term is the correct term 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because this man was part of an invading force If Russia were occupying our country and all you d already heard stories of torture and murder of innocents had relatives kicked out of their houses while the military searched for people who weren t there and heard of entire towns blown up as part of a  clearing exercise  you wouldn t blame the invading force instead of just the individual that killed your family  Edit fixed a typo
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I d rather live in a country that has Fox News has the most popular cable news channel than live in a country that has a government that censors the press  Honest question but why 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sadly I wish that were the case  As many have mentioned in this thread Obama has enacted policies and enforced laws which are erosions of both the amendments to the constitutions and the checks and balances of the consitution itself  I think Mr Minister did a good job of outlining some of them but also look at the Dept of Homeland Security s role in the coordinated effort to suppress protest movements like Occupy Wallstreet  While the protesters haven t been exactly innocent themselves the overwhelming oppressive dishonest and at times brutal relative to our experience response to these protests have left me completely disheartened with our President much less our two party political system  I wonder how long it will be before the middle class protesters experience their own Kristallnacht  Yes power has been consolidated out of the reach of the public and into the hands of the few for quite some time but when is the point of no return  
PoliticalDiscussion,Progress is supposed to be change for the better      the th amendment was not progress 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Depends on the president s party  Bingo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s bring back slavery while we re at it  There s no reason for progress 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just found out that FOX News is actually illegal in Canada because a news network is not allowed to knowingly spread false information in Canada   The Left always bans free speech 
PoliticalDiscussion,Better yet here s a reasonable discussion it s unreasonable to claim that a famed Constitutional scholar is destroying the Constitution just because simpletons don t understand its nuances 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even though I agree with you I think we can agree that the title at least is a poor one A more neutral one like  Let s have a reasonable discussion on Obama and the Constitution would have been better 
PoliticalDiscussion,there is no need for personal insults in this thread Furthermore I think what one of reddit is claiming could be successfully argued although I don t think he did a very good job  not that he didn t raise a good point it s just a somewhat unrelated point as it stands now    If I can think of a solid argument I d be more than happy to share it so long as you promise not to call me an ass 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sure life begins at conception Maybe even earlier because a sperm cell or ovum is alive They re generated from human cells so it s hard to argue that sperm and ova are are not human Why is it so special when the two come together  Completion of the DNA and it s own will to mature into a human being   gt When does a zygote embryo or fetus become an independent  Person  with rights Until recently that has always been birth and sometimes some period of time after birth to see if it will survive Fetus zygote life embryo human it s all semantics until we address the question of when something becomes a  Person  That debate is not decided   It has been decided by science     Physical stages of human life
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve been up for a little over  hours which is a lot for me so forgive me if this seems a bit incoherent but In my my high school journalism class we were taught not only the importance of the first amendment but also it s limitations Obviously this doesn t make me an expert but it did make me keenly aware of what is and isn t protected as free speech While the first amendment is  arguably the most important right guaranteed to us under the bill of rights it is not without certain limits According to the precedent set by new york times v sullivan the  case that is largely responsible for most modern interpretations of free speech as it concerns the media  and this is taken from the very same wikipedia article posted by doug there is grounds for a law suit if a public figure is defamed by someone  or in this case some news source with  knowledge that  information sited was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not   In other words if someone is accused of libel slander than these qualifications have to be met for it to go before a court After that of course the court will decide whether or not this is actually the case Now obviously in this case the court ruled in favor of the accused media outlet but the precedent set  which is constitutional until a future court decides otherwise makes what fox news is  accused of doing technically illegal though obviously nothing has been proven in court  Now whether or not this accusation is accurate we can t know for sure as it hasn t been successfully proven in court as of yet That being said the evidence that I have  which admittedly would  not be sufficient in an actual court strongly points to their guilt and as of now that is the only information I have with which to form my opinion  Don t get me wrong I m all for their right to raise legitimate concerns about the president or congress or whatever else they wan t but often times that isn t what they seem to be doing and it doesn t matter that they are  opinion shows as the precedent  to my knowledge does not specify the type of media necessary for the suit to go forward With the New York Times it was obviously an ad and while that case was overturned it wasn t overturned because of that which is likely how at least some of the current justices would likely view it   tl dr what fox news is accused of doing is illegal and while their is no proof of their guilt it would seem likely given what we do know  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Would you feel better if  the white man said  Fuck em let them sort their own mess out  Right I guess they did a great job with slavery and colonialism All they need now is white Jesus to come save them   gt How was I  dishing out insults  I don t have  the answer  I m not claiming to have the solution to all of Africa s problems I m simply defending a movement whose primary aim is to raise awareness from attacks by bitter contrarians  Let s see you ve called me childish and an idiot I am trying to be reasonable I want to discuss this issue but you seem to think that anyone who has a difference in opinion from you is an idiot which is pretty smug and obnoxious   gt I m pretty sure it s clearly stated in the viral video that Ugandans are trying to destroy him  with our help  and that he s not necessarily in Uganda Did you even watch the video  Look it is good that he  raised awareness  but he did not do it without issues  Seriously though did you watch the video Would you say that it was stated that Kony CLEARLY is not in Uganda Is it CLEAR that he hasn t been there in the last  years  Furthermore Ugandans aren t trying to destroy him but trying to move on with their lives There are tons of articles on this point    They love the  Osama bin Laden esque T Shirts and other awareness raising items celebrating Kony tho Nice touch on being sensitive to people s suffering     TfYdmeng       gt I ve never been to Africa I live abroad How about you  I live abroad do business with Africa have African clients  who I would now call some friends and have been to Africa  The common response I ve gotten from my clients there is that they want people to care and give consistent effort towards assistance and building up the people in Africa not fits and starts of things that are aggressive  read militant

PoliticalDiscussion,Evidently they left that bit out  As a Canadian I am glad you think highly of us  As a scientist I implore you to double check your sources    even if  especially if they agree with your political views    EDIT Thank you for naming your source when asked  How rude of me to not thank you for that before 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can we hold our congressmen to keep their election promises How can we vote for someone we truly like who we also think  by merit of their polls which are much easier to fake than a vote result has no chance in hell of winning An answer to the second is an  Instant Runoff Voting   system the first I have no answer for 
PoliticalDiscussion,The president takes an oath of office to defend the constitution If a president violates the constitution he screwed up his primary job We have an amendment process for a reason violating the constitution isn t progressive or conservative it just makes you power hungry 
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing is that even if you use a quote like that to demonstrate the other side s view it lowers the conversation tremendously  You basically say that that s all you think of their views That they re just some crazy right wing extremist talking about law and founding documents and that they re so off the boat that that s their argument It s hard to debate someone who thinks you re crazy 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Is Fox News a guvmint hating or guvmint loving channel  Depends on the president s party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hyperbole has no place in a reasonable discussion Unless we re talking about the president physically destroying a copy of the Constitution we should pick a different phrasing 
PoliticalDiscussion,    year   for several years That s the kind of money you need to raise to have any chance of winning 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He can t rightly not sign the bill appropriating money to the military for shit they ve already paid for  You are a slimy piece of shit you know that  Of all the Obama defenses the NDAA pisses me off the worst He easily could of vetoed it pushed the democrats to remove the bad language from the bill and send it back to him It probably could of been done in a day or two if they tried to moderately rush it 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are a Liberal if you advocate and or promote broken homes and unwed mothers Or are even indifferent Liberals like hiding behind that too   As for my proof just turn on the television and see the values they validate 
PoliticalDiscussion,How does it not matter  The text makes it very clear that the OP hears this argument from others and doesn t find it compelling  The OP is very clearly not making this argument or suggesting it is a valid one  If anything the OP suggests that it is a hyperbolic argument with no facts to back it up 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d rather live in a country that has Fox News as the most popular cable news channel than live in a country that has a government that censors the press  There is a subtle difference between outright lying and misrepresenting facts taking things out of context Fox News is more guilty of the latter And that s why the solution is to get your news from more than one source To me Fox News is no different than MSNBC Just two networks with really overt biases I like to flip back and forth between the two to see how each will frame a story   EDIT typos  
PoliticalDiscussion,I can just imagine this comment  years ago getting shit tons of upvotes when talking about Bush What we really need to do is start a thread of how Bush violated the constitution then show the numb skulls how Obama is doing a lot of the same things or extending them even farther Of course there would be excuses 
PoliticalDiscussion,But it does because the whole  debt for future generations has never been about exhausting natural resources but about government spending Legislation directed to control climate will have a cost and since we already don t pay what we spend there is little reason to assume that such legislation wouldn t further the kind of generational debt shifting that conservatives are actually concerned about 
PoliticalDiscussion,You put a lot of words in my mouth The argument is simply a case of moral empathy You re not putting yourself in the shoes of an Afghan victims family I m not choosing their morals over yours or mine but the whole  active duty and  war time argument aren t justified to me simply because a government provides a license to kill You really took my devils advocate and challenge to heart Regardless It s good to discuss things 
PoliticalDiscussion,go back to Bush years and ask yourself that same question   Anyone opposing Bush and the war was labeled a fucking traitor on fox     Freedom fries and Dead Dixie chicks  for speaking bad about Bush Now if you don t call for assassination of Obama you are not a card carrying member of GOP or tea party Reality check pls  If Romney is lucky enough to keep his foot out of his mouth long enough to take the WH Fox will turn back into the apologist network   Government is just doing the best it can the economy will come back just give it more time WATCH how fox will then take any report of the economy doing poorly and cover it up like they did during Bush years leading up to the crash 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes absolutely  We should censor free speech because that s what  smart people do   sarc
PoliticalDiscussion,I think what egalitarianusa is trying to say is that perhaps it was the conditions of the war that shaped his mental state or even damaged it Insanity plea seems likely and warranted for this type of crime   This is slightly off topic though We aren t his jury and we do not know the circumstances or even if there was more than one person involved What we are attempting to determine is where he should be tried to be the most fair It seems obvious to me that it should be an international court for this war crime Why the US is ignoring this legality is troubling at best 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fine  So you tell me what you thought the purpose of that show was 
PoliticalDiscussion,I read the text It doesn t matter though How the title is worded puts people in a certain mindset   Obama is destroying the Constitution    That s the definition of poisoning the well 
PoliticalDiscussion,do h that is what it was supposed to say 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hate to be uninformed in what way did he give aid or comfort to the enemy Is this not the man who killed over  Afghan civillians I realize civilians aren t the enemy but neither are they the  terrorists  enemy we are 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve actually   read  things about Fascism but let s take a look at what you just said   gt based on the supremacy of the state over the individual  So which is it Is Fox News a guvmint hating or guvmint loving channel You leftists cannot have it both ways 
PoliticalDiscussion,Now if only we could do the same thing here  Fuck the incoming downvotes A corporation should not be able to willfully lie and hide behind the fucking First Amendment And fuck Rupert Murdoch too 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that  rights are artificial including your right to know what the hell is going on with you If i believe with the best of intentions that you will go off the handle and suicide bomb my local kindergarten if you know you are about to die anyway even if you are not going to do it then it is my moral obligation to lie to you about your fate  I will look you in the eye and tell you  that you re fit as a fiddle you will live to be  and have many more happy memories even if your case of terminal liver failure is giving you another  hours of clear thought and another  days max of life   If i suspect you are a threat to anyone i aim to protect than my obligation is to lie fuck your rights to anything including self determination  The rights of any individual do not and should not superceede the rights of the many you want to live free and eat all the apples but there are a group of people who require apples to survive then you have to do without for the others   Just as there is no such thing as a true intrinsic right not protected by some power  usually force you have no rights that i am obliged to grant you if you want to learn about your own diagnosis i will not stop you if  you expect me to do all the work to learn about diagnosis and prognosis then you have no right to oblige me to share that info   I disagree that the rights of any individual should superceede that of society if it is well meaning even if it is poorly thought out  no one in saudi arabia has a right to free religion until the take that right from the government once they do they only have the right to try to defend it against superior force the only rights anyone has is that of free will no other obligation exists unless agreed upon by the group do not think otherwise you will be incorrect   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt FOX News is actually illegal in Canada  Buddy where did you learn this  Fox News is broadcast in Canada on cable  It s not illegal at all  We don t have a  Fox News Canada  true  But we do have Fox News   You have just    un  knowingly spread false information  
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt no one ever provides any examples of what these  lies are   Video  most egregious distortions  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the Harper government changed this and it is available just not on basic cable  Harper  conservative proponent of free markets   to be honest stifling free speech sounds good when it s hateful but no one s opinion or voice should be silenced that s the great thing that we ve all benefited from 
PoliticalDiscussion,Violating would have been a better word choice  
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed It is a fair description of the emotional duress the survivors may be experiencing though a senseless argument The legal thing to do would be to try him in international court If we are going to move toward a peaceful world we need to acknowledge these international laws and follow them 
PoliticalDiscussion,How about saying Obama s policies have generally limited liberties 
PoliticalDiscussion,I too am curious for an answer 
PoliticalDiscussion,The charity is still some time away but our team does bid on gov t tenders to supply medicine and wins regularly  In this way we supply medicines to the governments of developing countries for the lowest price possible Until we start our charity this is our small point of pride as we do feel like we re trying to do something positive for the world  I appreciate your equally reasonable reply 
PoliticalDiscussion,WOW  lt shake my head gt   edit  You have to broaden your net of information Just like financial investments do not put all your chips in one basket That clip is NOT a full episode it is just a few mins long  Please PROVE ME WRONG AND WATCH IT    Man up 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt no one ever provides any examples of what these  lies are and even if they do there is always something comparable to point to on the other networks  Name legal comparisons to the Jane Akre case by other media 
PoliticalDiscussion,Short Video That s a full Daily Show episode I m not watching that See unlike you I just don t watch or listen to political commentary that I don t like or otherwise don t want to listen to Do I call for it to be destroyed because I don t agree with it No Do I call for censorship because there could be some inaccuracies No Why Because if people want to listen to Jon Stewart rip into conservatives every single night then why shouldn t they be able to Why should the government regulate what people CHOOSE to listen to What good can possibly come out of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you look hard you ll find we re employing  people in the public sector for every  person you really need  Take everything divide by three  That s about all we really need  
PoliticalDiscussion,Mussolini one of the founding fathers noticed it looks a lot like  Corporatism which he coined the collusion of business and government     Let me guess you were going to say it wears a turban and hides in a cave And NAZI party maintained  Socialist polices because they kept the word in their name  after they commandeered the party     The German Nazi  National Socialist Party was politically fascist which is a corporatist racist overwhelmingly petty bourgeois pastiche of ideologies based on the supremacy of the state over the individual the importance of tightly centralized power and the fetishization of national myths and heroes Socialism is multinational and working class in character seeking to establish a fully democratic classless society   
PoliticalDiscussion,I completely agree Treading on the constitution shouldn t be a partisan issue I m a conservative libertarian and I received backlash from fellow ideologues for bashing Bush over the Patriot Act and the Iraq war as did many others But Bush is no longer our president Could we attempt to put him on trial for the things he s done Sure But what would it change What would it accomplish Nothing We need to stand up to what is CURRENTLY happening in Washington not what has happened in the past 
PoliticalDiscussion,Though I don t know about you but I didn t vote for that scumbag He just barely got a majority government with some of the lowest voter turn out ever 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But Fox IS ever bit of a successful Fascist Propaganda network that Goebbels would ever dream of   Learn what Fascism is you ass Goddamn 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shep is the best news man on tv period The rest of fox are activities and mouthpieces to spew GOP talking points CNN MSNBC are soccer mom mentality NOT LIBERAL LEFTY MARXIST as fox claims But Fox IS ever bit of a  successful Fascist Propaganda network that Goebbels would ever dream of   Every other news network is just reacting to what Fox says as they own the largest market   Sit back and watch this short video with direct crystal clear evidence  and tell me you fell the same way after   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s the same thing as during FDR new social programs that intrude into the everyday life are seen as unconstitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What s the definition of destroying Be specific   How about violating 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Disagree on IV TSA searches don t break the constitution There are plenty of legitimate forms of travel that are not airlines   I was thinking illegal search and seizure especially when it goes too far 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is plenty of programming on Fox that is great and certainly balanced The Fox Report with Shep Smith is probably my favorite cable network program and Fox Business is actually my primary source of cable News  Anyway to say that  Fox News lies   Rabble Rabble    but completely ignore the other networks is just bias bullshit First of all no one ever provides any examples of what these  lies are and even if they do there is always something comparable to point to on the other networks Fox News definitely has a conservative analyst line up during the prime time hours but these people are not  reporting the news so they can say whatever fucking retarded opinion they have   And we also have this thing called the First Amendment You know freedom of the press and all that jazz It s actually kind of one of our most important fundamental rights as a free society You don t like what you re hearing Then don t listen Change the channel Hell boycott it if you feel like an activist But when it comes to wanting the government to come in and regulate what messages and opinions can go out on the air waves be careful what you wish for 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Whenever I see posts like this my first thought is to always ask where you were when GWB was in office  I was criticizing Bush Why do you presume that someone who opposes unconstitutional acts is a hypocrite 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like all the people saying this just read the title of the post and ignored the actual text   edit  fixed spelling error
PoliticalDiscussion,Now let s take that discussion about what this president has done and put it into perspective of what all presidents have done 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m willing to bet the County elections are non partisan but if pressed OP would describe himself as a  moderate Republican  
PoliticalDiscussion, We quite obviously refers to the American government And your  mirrored example doesn t work because terrorists and insurgence are not operating forces of a government that responsibly regulates its military If you think this man is going to get off easy simply because he s being tried here you re delusional but he still deserves a fair and just trial under our constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why should the language be objectionable if it s accurate Is it some form of puritanical holdover from discussions about sex   People who hold that Obama is harming but not destroying the Constitution aren t excluded this isn t a dichotomy where you have to tick box A or B 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a largely outdated document that couldn t have possibly foreseen the kind of globalized and empowered world we have today There s a reason they expected us to amend it more than we do 
PoliticalDiscussion,All political discussions involve rhetoric That s not a bad thing Here I take destroying to mean changing or damaging such that the protections once afforded are now largely practically meaningless 
PoliticalDiscussion,Disagree on IV TSA searches don t break the constitution There are plenty of legitimate forms of travel that are not airlines   Not sure what you mean about Due Process Erosion and secret prisons and NDAA Most of the due process erosion was already in place when he took office he signed an executive order to close Gitmo but couldn t get it to actually close and signed a statement saying that his administration would not enforce the aspects of NDAA you all take issue with He can t rightly not sign the bill appropriating money to the military for shit they ve already paid for  th Amendment point is ridiculous It s not up to him it s up to the judge who ordered the fine   I ll give you electronic spying While it s hard for a president to veto certain things  NDAA  there was NO reason to resign the PATRIOT ACT 
PoliticalDiscussion,In a heartbeat  
PoliticalDiscussion,It is the language that is being objected to not the premise  If the conversation requrested is based on disproving any notion that Obama is  destroying the constitution anyone who would otherwise side against Obama s policies have to do so with that radical statment as their foundation which is unfair  
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe I should have put that in quotes That is not me saying that 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s the definition of destroying  Be specific    Really in this case  destroying is political rhetoric and rhetoric has not place in a reasonable discussion  
PoliticalDiscussion,Tribe is not always ethnic genetic just anyone you consider your people or on your side  Democrats are a tribe  the college educated are a tribe and  those of us who    are    consider ourselves  above nationalism racism and sexism are DEFINITELY a tribe  FTFY
PoliticalDiscussion,I actually thought this headline was satire 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Also sadly yes It would be nice if we were endowed with rights by God or someone that could never be challenged In the real world we only have those rights we can enforce and we do that through an agreed upon set of laws that are enforced by the government  Have you ever considered this is the root of the problem That  government protecting rights is an  inefficient and  dangerous way to protect individual rights I don t claim my way is perfect but at least in  free society you don t have to pay for my ideas It is  not possible to build a peaceful society if we as a society agree that it is okay to use aggressive force against peaceful individuals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Starting out with a logical fallacy is no way to have a reasonable discussion  If your title instead was  Can we have a reasonable discussion on the ways the current administration has been possibly misinterpreting  intentionally or unintentionally the Constitution    By starting with your conclusion in the title and with the negative statement  destroying  you ve already thrown reason out the window before the discussion has started   Another example of this would be  Can we have a reasonable discussion about Mitt Romney s evil views on corporation person hood  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why is that inflammatory when it s widely accepted to be true Obama s doing most everything Bush did and worse  illegal wiretapping illegal detentions assassination of American citizens unsanctioned war etc which was widely accepted to be destructive of the Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion, Ahem  
PoliticalDiscussion,What a terrible title 
PoliticalDiscussion,But  we still voted in a prime minister that wants to get rid of that law He is our George Bush  Edit put the word we in quotes cause I sure as hell didn t vote that way 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So we are enslaved at birth against our will to society I don t agree with this position  You are free to walk away  Stay and have a voice in what that slavery means fight the government and lose what freedom you do have or leave and find some other master     gt I want the option to choose someone else to defend my rights  You do  If you live in the U S and can vote you even get a voice in choosing who will make the laws you live under  If a vote isn t enough choice for you there are hundreds of other countries out there to choose from   gt Neither did the government What gives it a claim to that land  Sadly violence  They either paid off or killed everyone else that laid claim to the land  Does that make a claim valid  I don t know   gt So the only reason we have  rights is because the government says so  Also sadly yes  It would be nice if we were endowed with rights by God or someone that could never be challenged  In the real world we only have those rights we can enforce and we do that through an agreed upon set of laws that are enforced by the government  
PoliticalDiscussion,If that s the case why did you single out Obama in your headline Why not choose more impartial wording such as  Let s have a reasonable discussion about the decline of civil liberties over the last decade  
PoliticalDiscussion, No It s optimistic It s not like the people control politics the rich control politics Only rich scumfucks are polticians It is gonna take serious reforms to fix things and it has to be a bottom up thing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Now if only we could do the same thing here  Well that wouldn t work now would it since reddit is full of a bunch of dumbass high schoolers and college kids 
PoliticalDiscussion,How does this relate to what cassander said Keep using those fallacies 
PoliticalDiscussion,You should of picked something that was more opinion based Light color has a wavelength so yes there is a definition that can be checked You are wrong and an idiot 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is this harsh I guess OP hasn t been in r politics long The flame wars are much worse much much worse    
PoliticalDiscussion,Nailed it You picked apart the point that I had a huge issue with Brilliant analysis 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is interesting  the government usually holds that citizens do not have the right to break valid but unjust laws they have to go through the political process to get those laws changed first Strange then that the President should be able to ignore a constitution that is out of step with the nation 
PoliticalDiscussion,And a lot of them are lauded for the damage they did to it FDR was responsible for a massive increase in the size of the federal government and he achieved it by stretching the Commerce Clause beyond recognition 
PoliticalDiscussion,Out of curiosity does anyone know how you d go about getting an injunction or constitutional check on extrajudicial assassination of American citizens The federal government has sovereign immunity  unless it waives it  and the assassinated parties are typically unable to sue anyway It must be able to get before the Supreme Court  somehow though right  My knowledge of the American legal system is pretty thin 
PoliticalDiscussion, We didn t start the fire     It was always burning   Since the world s been turning   We didn t start the fire   No we didn t light it   But we tried to fight it 
PoliticalDiscussion,When hasn t the world been in a mess While I don t like the current generation of politicians I think the problem is they grew up in the height of the cold war We in the western world need to get over the idea that we can force people to change it just causes more hurt then it s worth 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why change the constitution and not our outlook on it  It s a simple short document that is supposed to be quite bare bones and straight forward with everything else left you the states you and me    This nation was an idea a completely revolutionary idea that you have dominion over your own life liberty and property  This is what the constitution represents and protects and these ideals are timeless   I m in no way against amendments but if an amendment isn t helping to advance the intent behind the constitution and is merely to  go with the times then it has no place there   If this change and evolve over time is bigger government with more say in our every day lives then that is the exact opposite of what the framers intended  It s the exact opposite of why your grand parents or great grandparents left the old country for   Do you know who seized power during the constitutional convention  A ton of  rich white guys in a room designing the rules for a nation   Nobody  Nobody seized power  They left it to us  There s a story that Thomas Jefferson was working on the constitution and a woman came up to him   what are you making   a republic if you can keep it   If America falls it will crumble from the inside 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just look at surveys regarding peoples positions on topics like gay marriage The approval rating is much higher within individuals aged   and it seems unlikely that all of these young adults will change their mind as they get older Public perception of racial issues and so on is definitely shifting  Yes you re right there will always be racists and homophobes However I m not saying racism and homophobia will be things of the past just that they re definitely on the decrease 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  ths rule was an attempt to control the sway of the southern states in the representative house  The framers reasoned that if the south did not perceive these slaves as  people  then they could not count for a full person for representation purposes  It seemed wrong to them that they could use the vast number of slaves to increase their numbers in the government but not apply any of the benefits of citizenship to them  Thomas Jefferson himself denounced slavery in an early draft of the D of I  These guys knew it would never hold up 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t want this to sound rhetorical I m just gonna lay out some facts  Obama talks about  fundamentally changing America  Ask yourself what are the fundamentals of America and in what  documents are they written  America was founded on these things these truths we hold to be self evident  Life liberty pursuit of happiness  Limited federal government and individual liberties  So for me given what the fundamentals of America are when he says he wants to change them well I m not so sure we re all talking about the same thing  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The baby boomer generation will be the first to leave the world in a worse state than they inherited  If you re speaking about America strictly I d definitely be inclined to agree The parents of the baby boomers did so much for the States  it s mind boggling Sadly what they passed on  I believe the boomers took for granted or even in some cases used their parent s success to falsely promote themselves as  self made men  e g  Romney    They most definitely squandered our debt and destroyed our social security system They led us into needless and costly wars They are a  buy now figure out how to pay for it later generation through and through  I m angry that they sit on their asses and push for wars with other nations  e g  Iran and then my peers and classmates are the ones who end up doing the actual fight and dying  I m infuriated by the fact that they ll all be dead before the shit hits the fan and we re left picking up the pieces but I take solace in the fact that we ll write the history books 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh irony how i missed you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I live in Australia where prostitution is legal only in Brothels which are quite tightly regulated I believe this is the best of both worlds and simply don t see a problem with it Nobody is being coerced into the job  if they are its still illegal The way its done the girls and guys and everything in between are checked for diseases very often and humanely The only argument against this is a moral stance I suppose but then again market forces demand that there be a market for prostitution so why not make it as harmless and un exploitative as possible Isn t it more immoral to ban prostitution thereby creating a black market run by violent criminals and causing more pain and suffering than it is to allow a little bit of immorality by legalizing brothels 
PoliticalDiscussion,From my knowledge I ve never heard that the founders wanted it changed frequently  The whole point was to have a very consistent set of limits on the federal government  But they DID know it needed to be changed and that s why there is an amendment process  If they wanted it to be changed more frequently they wouldn t have designed the amendment process to be so difficult  There s  ways to do it and only one of them has ever even been used and it s only happened  times in our history  Which would put us at an average of about once every  years but considering the first  happened all at once it s more like once every  years or so  Looking at it from that angle not a bad pace  given that    all happened pretty close together too   Honest and non incendiary question what do you think needs to be updated for the current century 
PoliticalDiscussion,A reasonable discussion is by definition grounded in reason not rhetoric We can have an impassioned discussion and use that sort of language but that would be a different thing altogether 
PoliticalDiscussion,One does not have to banish all racist thoughts or actions to be less racist than their fore bearers  I personally would think that a completely un racist world would be unhealthy simply due to the fact that racism is to a certain degree  although unequally reinforced sociologically genetically encoded in our tribal nature    I don t think it s really a stretch to say that America will become less racist over time as I think that historically public opinion has shifted  feel free to unpleasantly surprise me with contradictory evidence towards being less racist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Every generation has its own problems Though I will admit corruption and general cuntiness does seem a lot more frequent in the  Baby Boomers than anything I ve seen in any Historical records since the days of Kings and Queens   Whether or not that s because there s actually more of it or just because it s more noticeable I couldn t say though Either way it s a massive problem and makes me agree with your  Can they just fuck off comments 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The baby boomer generation will be the first to leave the world in a worse state than they inherited  By what metric  I honestly have a hard time believing this statement other than for some as of yet unaddressed population problems and or  the highly related climate change issues  If you look at the poor in the moderately rich and the rich countries and compare them to the poor in the same countries  years ago you ll see vast quality of life improvements    Sure we have different problems now but for the vast majority of people smallpox or polio would have much worse implications for their personal lives than say global warming consequences    Our wars are getting smaller  Iraq Afghanistan vs the Soviet s Afghanistan and U S  Vietnam vs WWI WWII   Globally people are becoming much more empowered than ever before  Case in point I remember someone  from a TED talk maybe  who said that  years ago you would choose to be an average student in Iowa over a poor genius in India but with today s globalization and the mobility of ability being a poor genius in India allows you to successfully compete with that average student in Iowa  It seems to me that the defining problems of  our generation will not be in creating new technological ability  that s not to say we can t royally fuck up much of what the Baby Boomers have done correctly  but rather how will we apply what we have learned and how will we use our abilities differently than the generation before us 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have yet to manage to actually do anything besides insult me This always happens when we talk I out argue you and you name call Keep it up kelustu 
PoliticalDiscussion,I really want to agree with you but I can t Throughout history almost every grouping of people has been  racist and not accepting of  others or minority groups While by some miracle America might become less racist over time  which is a real stretch  I see little evidence that Earth as a whole will There will always be people who are afraid think they are better than others
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know how you could deny that when baby boomers were our age the world was in a far worse state than it is now  There is a lot of terrible stuff happening right now but unfortunately that is always the case and the things happening in the mid th century were pretty undeniably far worse than those things going on right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can anyone really take you seriously with your name It conjures up an image of an angry bitter redneck typing furiously away on a keyboard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Says who Hyperbole is fine to use in reasonable discussions It s just a device like a metaphor 
PoliticalDiscussion,I read the title and my first thought was Abraham Lincoln There s no denying that he was one of our greatest presidents but he treated the Constitution like he caught it breaking into his house  Come to think of it Obama often states how he tries to follow in Lincoln s footsteps   
PoliticalDiscussion,sorry from the context and connotation I assumed you were inferring outdated  bad  I also inferred the last bit to be snarky my apologies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I said NOTHING about it being a bad model Or about it being a bad document Nothing at all It simply does not address major issues of our time and is largely ineffective at guiding us in our limits in a globalized world And again our founders intended for us to amend and update it for more than we do  Outdated does not mean wrong or bad It means it needs updating Generation  iPods are outdated They are not bad or useless or wrong They inspired a wave of technological advancement so great that almost every single person that can afford an iPod has one or a device like it It s similar with our Constitution It was and is wildly inspirational and important but it needs updating 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt First do you have an IPod Why don t you sell your computer Why are you posting here on reddit and not volunteering with the peace corps I am disinclined to listen to preaching from somebody I have reason to believe isn t practicing it  No no no I m not preaching altruism I don t believe in altruism I don t have a problem with self interest I do practice what I preach I am pointing out   someone else s  hypocrisy someone who argues against self interest and in favor of altruism but does not practice what THEY preach Don t get confused   gt Secondly the average Reddit user is in the lowest income bracket Rich by world standards certainly but turning that wealth into meaningful change is far from simple  Good excuse It s clear that this is what everyone is telling themselves The idea that you could not easily turn some of your assets into meaningful change is simply false and evidence that you are probably just lazy and in denial of your own greed   gt Ascetism is not a solution to poverty changing the economic system is  We re talking about altruism not ascetism Who says we need to solve poverty in the first place Well  altruists  mostly  Altruists who only want to be altruistic with other people s money i e fake altruists 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because you re an fucking mouthbreathing window licking absolute undeniable moron who refuses to understand or comprehend facts when they are presented 
PoliticalDiscussion,reddit re ordered my numbers because it thinks I m an idiot I hope you guys can figure out which ones they re meant to correlate to my  is correlating to his stimulus package nonsense Not only did it not supersede  state authority  they could refuse money though none did  it doesn t violate any clause in the Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Using those words metaphorically constitutes hyperbolic rhetoric If Stalin  cut off food supplies thereby causing starvation that would be a tragic manmade famine but not a massacre  I m just saying that a reasonable discussion should use neutral language whenever possible In that context a better title for this post would ve at least been  let s have a reasonable discussion on the the claim that Obama is  destroying the constitution  That would let us talk about whether that s appropriate terminology The title we have here says we have to discuss the fact that Obama is destroying the Constitution See what I mean 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Right I guess they did a great job with slavery and colonialism All they need now is white Jesus to come save them  You didn t answer my question   gt Let s see you ve called me childish and an idiot  You called me self righteous neo colonial and made an accusation about my ancestors   gt Look it is good that he  raised awareness  but he did not do it without issues   Without issues  What does that mean   gt Seriously though did you watch the video Would you say that it was stated that Kony CLEARLY is not in Uganda Is it CLEAR that he hasn t been there in the last  years  It was clear to me that he may be in other areas yes   gt Furthermore Ugandans aren t trying to destroy him but trying to move on with their lives  All of them They don t all think the same thoughts Of course there must be different feelings about the matter   gt The common response I ve gotten from my clients there is that they want people to care and give consistent effort towards assistance and building up the people in Africa  I am arguing in favor of raising awareness There is no need to choose between doing what your clients want and raising awareness Information awareness is free 
PoliticalDiscussion,A baby boomer would probably dismiss these comments as youthful naivete and insist that the world will be in a worse state after our generation becomes the driving force in politics I couldn t decide either way but I do think the Earth of the future will be much more accepting of minority groups and decidedly less racist Whether or not we can run it better is hard to forecast and definitely debatable  Only time will tell 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This type of comment that you have constructed is a typical strawman I ve seen used against liberals and anti corporatists  My comment was sufficiently qualified  It really seems like you and many others  A wrongful accusation of  strawman is in itself a strawman you know   Let s be careful not to just throw the word around   gt This ignores a few truths about domestic vs international economics We may earn more than people in poorer economics but our income is still relative to the markets we live in  may go a long way in a poorer nation but then again  is not going to get me much in my home country  more accurately      since I am British   That s certainly true to an extent but it doesn t account for the gap so it isn t really a relevant point   gt the argument you re putting forth is an attempt at making those who argue for taxes on the rich out to be hypocrites  If their argument is one of principle based on the idea that self interest profit are below morally neutral which it almost always is then they  are hypocrites   gt On an abject level you are correct we are well off this is undeniable But on a relative level you re not  Relative to whom Most people only seem interested in  relating their wealth to people above them You never hear anyone say  I m much wealthier than that person It s not fair    gt People in America shop at Wal Mart for the good prices and then complain when smaller businesses get put out of business Until one corrects ones own part in helping this profilerate we cannot chastise the rich for doing the same  We are in complete agreement 
PoliticalDiscussion,its much more than just government Government is merely a representation of the citizens that elect them to office  in democracies at least 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ignorance Hypocrisy Ego Corruption Dishonesty Greed Myopic Thinking Selfishness Apathy Religious Cultural intolerance 
PoliticalDiscussion,The entire point is that it s not clear what the words massacre or destroy mean yet you feel differently about the application of those two terms Why is that 
PoliticalDiscussion,thank you for adding truth to this discussion

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Suppliers identify demand they do not create it  This is not always the case Sometimes there is no demand because nobody knows the product or service exists yet That s part of the tremendous risk involved in entrepreneurship  But let s say someone has identified demand What happens after the demand has been identified 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why don t you find where I mentioned the government  Ok You said  emphasis mine      gt It s pretty easy for a group of people to decide  democratically  Democracy is a system of   government     gt Only in capitalism Because so many people recognize the inherent unfairness of capitalism Just one of a host of problems that capitalism creates  What a joke Not worth my time arguing with someone who is so far gone as to make contorted arguments like that  Listen  the system is people 
PoliticalDiscussion,If he were committing a massacre then it would be appropriate There s already clear non hyperbolic language we can use to talk about violating ignoring invalidating etc the Constitution Destroying is just a poor choice of words and also happens to bias the argument in one direction which is not very useful 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then you would be center If I understand you correctly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ad hominem Do some reading fella

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The US is the only country that has a notion of Corporate Personhood yet corporations pay taxes without being legal persons in other countries  What is normal or not normal in other countries doesn t matter   gt You don t have a very strong argument in favor of corporate personhood either  I m not arguing in favor of corporate personhood I m arguing in favor of consistency Taxation without representation is theft If you re going to tax a corporation it must have representation rights etc  As I said before I don t believe corporations are people  Have we switched places over the course of this discussion  Corporations are collectives of people and the rights of the individuals survive the collection If each individual within the collective has freedom of speech everyone within the collective together  i e the collective has freedom of speech Each individual is already taxed there is no reason to tax them again as a collective  It must be consistent the Supreme Court has made it consistent and as a voter I will oppose any candidate or ideology which aims to make it inconsistent This traditional conservatism is essentially a protective barrier against the political whims of the left who seek to wield the power of the state as it is convenient for them to do so  That s traditional conservatism I m not talking about or representing modern conservatives

PoliticalDiscussion,You aren t uninformed treason just isn t one of the charges he would face 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok people this comment should not be downvoted Agree with it or not it is one of the few that actually answers my question 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know why people harp on the fact that drone strikes are against American citizens  under the Constitution   everybody  has a right to a fair trial  The administration s argument is that these are wartime decisions and there s a legal precedent however shaky  That these are  on United States citizens is irrelevant to the conversation  Also maybe this is tongue in cheek but really how did Fast   Furious  violate the Second Amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not happy about any of this stuff but it s worth pointing out that the Constitution besides being open for interpretation  in most people s view if not necessarily in mine  has never really been in much better shape  Legislators and presidents have ignored or liberally reinterpreted unambiguous articles for centuries to fit their own devious ends 
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt LSD can cause flashbacks years after taking the drug at any time  LSD flashbacks are caused only by heavy and prolonged and use of the drug and even then they re a pretty rare occurrence and sometimes don t even happen at all This type of LSD use is debateably irresponsible and not representative of what your average tripper would experience whatsoever Regardless of what causes LSD flashbacks and when I think you have a skewed perception of what they actually are and how much they would effect your motor skills and decision making In the event of a flashback when driving a school bus full of young children it would be simple enough just to pull the bus over and stop It s not all marmalade skies and disconnection from reality more like mild visuals and a slightly altered frame of mind as opposed to a full blown trip It wouldn t be very safe and I m not advocating doing it but you could probably get away with just driving the bus   times  Your line of argument in this paragraph is probably the strongest of the three but it s ultimately flawed in that any  responsible use of drugs will not have a marked negative effect on the community and those close to the user as well as the user themself I am of the opinion that proper education regarding the effects of drugs and regulated legalisation is a much better option than the lies and slander perpetuated by the government in combination with a blanket ban on all drugs  Additionally   I think you re presenting a false dilemma here  with the legalisation of PCP and crack as well as cannabis and LSD I don t know a whole lot of people who want to see the former legalised but reddit is in almost unanimous agreement regarding the legalisation of cannabis and to a lesser extent other psychedelic drugs Some of the statistics you have cited and points you have raised hold some weight but only in regard to these  hard drugs with high potentials for addiction and arguably lower positive contributions to the life of an individual Show me an example of a death from someone smoking too much pot or someone who came home after a long night hitting a bong and beat up their wife and kids  PS You need to fix your asterisk placement in  argument   as it s not coming up in bold text  PPS Your username is not at all conducive to rational debate or intelligent discussion I almost didn t reply based on it

PoliticalDiscussion,I wholeheartedly agree
PoliticalDiscussion,I really thought this was r circlejerk for a minute there 
PoliticalDiscussion,which is why its the model in which most democracy s have followed as well as the UN bill of human rights Yep rights and a government based on a law instead of a ruler is outdated 
PoliticalDiscussion,damn beat me to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Every president since the War Resolution Act of  has declared the act itself to be unconstitutional On top of this Obama wasn t the first president to disregard it Clinton was Not that this is in any way saying that he s absolved of anything but the idea that Obama is destroying the constitution doesn t seem to take into account that the precedent wasn t set by him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Although I m not what one would call a  judicial expert the concept of the Constitution as a  living document  usually associated with the liberal wing of SCOTUS could be applied to the Obama administration Essentially this view of the Constitution argues that the Articles and Amendments in the Constitution should be read broadly so that they can be applied more easily to present day phenomenon  The flip side is to read the Constitution with a narrow lens  usually associated with the conservative wing of SCOTUS especially Justice Clarence Thomas  People who take a narrow view of the Constitution usually adhere to a strict interpretation of what the Constitution actually says  versus what it can be interpreted to say   Now of course folks on either side can use either view of the Constitution to further their aims although usually each side adheres to the visions I wrote of above  When right leaning people talk Obama about  destroying the Constitution they usually follow that statement  in my experience with something about the healthcare reform law Because this law is the first to compel a person to purchase a good  i e make it illegal to NOT purchase something right wing people see it as a perversion of the interstate commerce clause and of Supreme Court precedent  tl dr Supreme Court 
PoliticalDiscussion, he can t rightly not sign the bill appropriating money to the military for shit they ve already paid for  That s a documented verified and well known fact You took issue with that This world would be better off without you in it You are literally the most useless idiotic and scummy person I ve ever had the displeasure of coming across and I hope every time you post that something horrible will happen to you Honestly stop responding to my posts you aren t intellectually qualified to respond to me  You aren t fit to wipe my asshole and pay for me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neither of those detracts from the fact that it met its CBO budget projections  That doesn t mean it s a good law just that your original assertion was completely wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,ever heard of the doughnut hole or the fact it allows insurance companies to double charge Guess not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Makes a claim that is fairly supported in this thread and very obvious in  r politics Tons of downvotes 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I believe X and say X it isn t lying even if X is false 
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare part D is the only major healthcare bill ever passed in the US that has actually met its budget expectations  You really should learn your facts before accusing other people of being liars 
PoliticalDiscussion,of course it s not always that simple i don t know if that statement is a lie and i probably never will opinions speculation should always be allowed blatant disregard for empirical fact is a different story  e g fox often lies about anthropogenic climate change 
PoliticalDiscussion,And in the s SS and Medicare caid were created Your point We vote them in you know Do your share of educating people how to vote instead of always blaming the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t really mean this can you  The world is not always that simple  Is  We invaded iraq to spread democracy a lie 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s a good quote from Justice Hugo Black regarding absolute protection of the First Amendment this was from  New York Times Co v United States   In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy   The press was to serve the governed not the governors The Government s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government   The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government   To better answer your question on how that relates to my personal views this is in line with how I personally feel as well  One of my motto s in life is  the pendulum always swings both ways    meaning that within this context I d rather live in a country where ALL views can be expressed   those I agree with and those I do not agree with than live somewhere which a government protects certain views over others be they my own or not    In a free society we cannot rely on government to determine what is acceptable and what is not within the confides of the press THAT is far closer to Fascism than Fox News has ever been  to partly answer a comment lower down and not directed at hollowman  Hope that helps you seem my POV 
PoliticalDiscussion,and who do you think the government works for people who think that expanding the reach and power of the government is   always  bad are crazy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like how you just say I m wrong but don t give a justification Even with my  insult I managed to show how you are full of shit We can still be nasty to each other but at least try to put up a decent attack without simply relying on an empty claim and an Ad Hominem 
PoliticalDiscussion,The sky is green   Who should determine that this is a lie The answer is nobody in particular It is objectively false Nobody can  determine whether true facts are lies or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think your fine you asked a question and people are attacking the question without answering it I am curious as well 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A rational discussion would involve more than just refuting any statement that you can and ignoring the ones that are right  I didn t refute that particular one because I don t have enough facts or knowledge to debate that issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about Libya I would at least concede that going there for more than  days without congressional approval was violating the constitution A rational discussion would involve more than just refuting any statement that you can and ignoring the ones that are right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed in retrospect the title was not objective wording 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who determines what is lying and what isn t I sure as hell don t want some sort of government truth committee That s what this boils down to Thankfully we have plenty of non profit organizations and think tanks that monitor news organizations   we have to keep in mind those are a pretty recent development in the world of journalism It used to be that you had to just trust the newspaper and the nightly news   there was no check on it whatsoever  Yes the press should be able to spread propaganda   all outlets do this in some form or fashion to begin with An Op Ed piece in the NYT is the same thing as Bill O Reilly spouting off about whatever They re both designed to change the way you think about something   But shouldn t the whole point of the news be to change the way people think I don t mean that in the brainwashing sort of way but rather in the informing and educating sort of way All free societies have a high level of press freedom there is no doubt about that   And still we have some reasonable restrictions on press freedom For example a newspaper can t publish libel about a private citizen without running the risk of getting sued out the ass There s grey area about what that means but I think it s overall a well intentioned idea   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not just this century though Presidents back through John Adams have been accused of violating and destroying it 
PoliticalDiscussion, Went through NATO Technically not unconstitutional  No Wrong Just factually blatantly at its core wrong  Congress authorized the President to dole out that money so again blatantly wrong  Conservative justices have defended it in lower courts 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know as well as everyone else that the oath is largely a formality and it is not his primary job His job isn t to be out there enforcing the letter of the law of the Constitution Not anymore The presidency and our nation have largely changed and evolved over time Our Constitution has not and we need to amend it Not overhaul but update 
PoliticalDiscussion,I live in Ontario Canada and I get Fox news from Bell Canada It s not banned illegal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because it s not updated for the current century It needs to be revised and amended more than it is There s a reason that the founders expected it to be changed more frequently 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Made Recess Appointments Article II Sec   the recess can only be a maximum  day recess as prescribed under Article  Sec  can t he wait    Article  Sec  does not refer to recesses it is talking about adjournments while congress is in session The constitution has no clear definitions of minimum maximum times for recess appointments However see  Mackie v Clinton on the legality of  day appointments    gt  Overthrew State governments with Stimulus Package  b   If funds provided to any State in any division of this Act are not accepted for use by the Governor then acceptance by the State legislature by means of the adoption of a concurrent resolution shall be sufficient to provide funding to such State   That s an interesting argument So you say that if the governor says he doesn t want money from the feds but the state senate says it does want the money that constitutes an overthrow of the state government and violates the constitution Anyway this doesn t even matter this was an act of congress not the president    gt  GM Bailout only congress has any authority with money  Okay this was funded congress but the use of those funds for the auto industry vs the financial industry was a big stretch by both Bush and Obama    gt  ObamaCare  Supreme Court is currently doing the ruling   Invalid This was Congress 
PoliticalDiscussion,We also have Sun TV News which we commonly referred to as Fox News North
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay lemme rephrase it and preface it by saying it s not sarcastic or anything I really want to know what people think  The reason that to quote the original question  I d rather live in a country that has Fox News has the most popular cable news channel than live in a country that has a government that censors the press  is because it s the first amendment Or the first amendment just echos your own views 
PoliticalDiscussion,   like If you re talking about random police search and seizures that s not Obama s doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry I don t really go to  r politics because of people like kelustu More of a discussion guy

PoliticalDiscussion,It has been my observation that all people consider themselves to be the rational center in politics no matter where they actually fall on the left right scale 
PoliticalDiscussion,the people know only what they are told by Fox since Fox has pre emtped them from learning anything from any other news outlet which are all labeled the enemy    Can you not see they are a product of misinformation that hardly is a wining position   A strong conservative network based on facts and Merritt not hearsay and innuendo         Fox was out front on EVERY issue for the Bush admin as their personal news network Apologies for the exploding debt Bush spending like a drunk sailor and reasons why we HAD to borrow so much after    debt stood at  Trillion Obama Inauguration day  Apologies for how long it is taking to train Iraqi forces Apologies and cover up for Halliburton over charging for meals never served running empty trucks putting our troops in harms way for profit serving food laden with bullets from road side attacks or forcing them to eat only twice a day becoming easy targets for numerous insurgent shelling poisoning our troops with untreated water even fucking electrocuting them with faulty wiring in their showers because they took  million  contracts and sub contract them out for k to shit workers  A dozen solydras but not a peep out of fox  I don t remember the Dems wiretapping our phones illegally and playing slight of hand via Fox news to make excuses The Patriot Act how many months did Bush Cheney refuse a   investigation with Fox spin and protection  The list goes on and on with REAL fraud and damage to our nation but fox was an apologist true and true THey bullied all the other news networks who joined in on the chorus to go to war without any vetting Any discussion against invading Iraq was seen as unpatriotic traders and all originated back to the  rat pack on Fox  Kristol Krauthammer Pearl Humme they all promised Iraq would be a few weeks and pay for itself  Even congress was bullied along with the CIA which Cheney personally visited over  times to parse the intel and point to  facts he wanted to see in reports including his nefarious  curve ball informant the CIA later turned against  FREEDOM FRIES AND DEAD DIXIE CHICKS  That is some liberty for ya   all from Fox  news 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re absolutely right I m sure he and his legal team are currently coming up with evidence to prove that he indeed was being threatened The forcible felony Well if we take him at his word then I m guessing he ll say that the kid attacked him tried to take his gun and it went off during the scuffle As far as his evidence of a struggle they ll blame the cops and say that since he wasn t processed immediately that the bruises and scrapes he suffered had healed I can imagine his defense already Something like  I was very emotional after the incident and barely slept after the police let me go that night I felt that there was no need to document any injuries I sustained as I knew I was in the right But I wish the police had documented them themselves so there would be no question as to what I endured  Remember Cases get really screwed up when the police screw up themselves and don t make proper reports or document these things 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt buying a Toyota Corolla today is a much better value  at least in an economic non collector sense than a  s Mustang  Especially since there were no Mustangs in the s  they were introduced in    Arguably sports cars from the s and s were more fun to drive but you re right about their utilitarian value not to mention their capacity to pollute the atmosphere 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are basic rights that are non negotiable and not up to the determination of the majority  You re confusing socialism with tyranny of the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,What forcible felony  The kid was just walking down the street talking on the phone to his girlfriend  What evidence did he have to support a claim of potential forcible felony  And will he ever be placed in a position where he has to show evidence to support his  stand your ground claims 
PoliticalDiscussion,And if they come out inconclusive does this bring in the question of reasonable doubt 
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt So what do you do in cases where someone is behaving peacefully but is still infringing on the rights of another and will not comply with instructions to stop My point is that force is an important tool While it should be used judiciously and sparingly sometimes it needs to be used  You are right It is very very important I completely agree with you on this point   gt Part of using it judiciously is appointing certain people who are allowed to use force and then the rest of us judging whether it was appropriate afterward  This is where we completely disagree however If we grant certain people these rights it gives those individuals too much power How do we solve this It s very easy do not grant  anyone the authority to use  aggressive force  Grant  everyone the right to  retaliatory force  This approach to society is essentially You leave me alone  my self property etc and I leave you alone You attack steal from me and I am entitled to repayment It is simply not possible to prevent force with force so instead lets build a society based upon voluntary interactions and cooperation  In this situation it goes directly to the people to judge instead of through the power hierarchy of government People are  directly accountable to other people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s the law    A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to   prevent  the commission of a forcible felony   I m sure he will argue that he was trying to prevent the commission of a forcible felony and that he had every legal right to be where he was As it relates to  chasing someone I m sure he could argue that he was of course following the person as it is his duty as the leader of the Neighborhood Watch Group 
PoliticalDiscussion,No A treaty is signed by the president and ratified by congress   majority and then in theory could be struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court The constitution states that the supreme court is the supreme law of the land To change that would take a constitutional amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re doing voice analysis of the  calls   If they can prove that it was the teenager screaming then Zimmerman is   fucked   because it goes  bang  screams for help  bang  and you can t claim self defense while lining up a killshot on a pleading kid who you ve already shot once already   And if he goes into prison I highly doubt he ll come out alive unless he spends it in solitary 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not think somebody can claim to be  standing their ground if they chase somebody down and attack them     EDIT   We often here the words Assault and Battery in the same breath but they are two different things Assault is an act that creates an apprehension in another of an imminent harmful or offensive contact If you chase somebody down in a dark ally and angrily shout at them you are committing assault   Trayvon was acting in self defense even if he shoved first but the fact that there are ZERO indications that he had any aggressive feelings toward Zimmerman combined with the fact that Zimmerman had already described Trayvon as an  asshole gives weight to the argument that Zimmerman is not only guilty of assault but battery and thus murder since his use of his gun was not in self defense   If you start a fight which chasing somebody down in a dark ally clearly is you are not entitled to the self defense defense   I m no lawyer though so what the fuck do I know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Couldn t any treaties we participate in obligate us to do so in theory I don t know of any treaties that we have or have not agreed to that would obligate us to accept an international court   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It is not possible to build a peaceful society if we as a society agree that it is okay to use aggressive force against peaceful individuals  So what do you do in cases where someone is behaving peacefully but is still infringing on the rights of another and will not comply with instructions to stop  My point is that force is an important tool  While it should be used judiciously and sparingly sometimes it needs to be used  Part of using it judiciously is appointing certain people who are allowed to use force and then the rest of us judging whether it was appropriate afterward  
PoliticalDiscussion,His her point was that those rights that are stated to apply to all men  meaning people in the modern usage  not just American citizens  The point is that we should be concerned about the assassinations of anyone without a fair trial not just American citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think FDR really hurt this country but I ve got to be careful about saying that around here  He might  or might not I don t know have been doing what he thought was best  However he should not have ignored the Constitution in order to get things done  By doing so he set a precedent that shows that it is okay to ignore the Constitution if one thinks they should  This opens the door to all kinds of abuses of power by the government and the government has been taking full advantage of this  There is a very clear cut process that can be used to amend the Constitution if one really believes that the government should do something that the Constitution currently prohibits  However amending the Constitution is hard work and actually requires a large amount of support for the proposed amendment so presidents and the government in general would much rather just skip the work and ignore the Constitution  FDR who is idolized by the far left in the same way that Reagan is idolized by the far right took advantage of a turbulent time in US history and in doing so made twisting and ignoring the Constitution much easier for the future government to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you mean before he added the paragraph that is bolded and labeled  edit   That doesn t really change anything All the rest of it was there as soon as I saw this post and clearly explains the OP is not making the argument in the title at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just to be clear what you propose isn t  doing something to fix our broken system It is conceding admitting defeat The reason we have such shitty choices is b c what is supposed to be the smart reasonable half of the country decides to vote Cthulhu out of apathy while the nonsensical half gets organized votes and gets their guy  of the douchebag or shit sandwich persuasion elected You sir are part of the problem and what you suggest will only exacerbate it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Have you ever been in line at the DMV and thought  Man this is a model of modern efficiency this line moves so much quicker than the checkout lines at Target or Costco   The line at the DMV is slow precisely because legislators would rather waste your time than pay DMV employees more  Making that line faster and more efficient would cost  more money   gt I do not have documentation  Yes that s what I thought  You re just speculating with no evidence whatsoever   gt So you get taxed at X  An X tax rate is supposed to pay for the government The government should spend to a budget within X   Huh  What are you talking about  There is no  supposed to  because there is no plan  Our tax code is completely haphazard and politically driven  Bush didn t ask his advisers  what level of taxation would adequately fund needed government services    He asked them  what is the biggest tax cut I can get away with    gt Let s say I m a basic manager and I have a basic manager s salary I get paid by how many people I give welfare to  Again do you have any evidence to support this idea  Or are you just speculating  Do you even care whether your idea of how government employees get paid matches up with reality  It seems like you just have a total hatred of government employees that is completely independent of actual interactions or data of who these people are or the jobs they do  In the corporate world you probably understand perfectly intuitively how paying high salaries attracts good workers and encourages efficiency  But in the public sector you ve got conflicting beliefs that we should radically cut salaries and that we should radically improve efficiency  And it s fascinating that you chose welfare as the example  Over the last  years the number of welfare beneficiaries has dropped  by two thirds   Work C Earnings C and Poverty   Like I said before politicians are constantly looking for ways to cut government spending without impacting important services  If there were tons of useless employees their jobs would be rushed to the chopping block in order to free up money for tax cuts or services that people actually use   gt We re still paying X  and we ve seen great lay offs in the last few years The amount government has received has lessened So even before the depression we had too many people after the depression we still have too many people  You re just repeating yourself and trying to make it sound like an argument  we had too many people so obviously we have too many people   What is your reasoning 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know what you re saying man I just don t see it as having anything to do with the fundamental problems in our society You re never going to get rid of corruption with legislation You re never going to switch to a public funding system if most people don t give a shit You re never going to change the situation if the majority of people don t care  The problem with your argument is that you re proposing to democratically fix a system that is already democratic If you can  fix the system democratically then the system is already working If the problem is fundamentally people as I suspect it is then you re never going to change the system democratically If you managed to educate the people enough to recognize that there is a problem then the problem would be solved in that instant People could then vote more responsibly and you wouldn t have to pass any campaign finance reform You know what I mean 
PoliticalDiscussion,Santorum wouldn t have a chance in hell of getting elected Typically only  of voting age Americans vote in Presidential elections People who don t vote tend to be left center more or less satisfied with the status quo If he was the nominee shit tons of these people who don t normally vote would get their asses to the poll booths I like to think of them as  voter reserves for when fucktards like Palin or Santorum get too close to the White House 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oddly enough it was the Republicans which killed the Doctrine   And now they reap the rewards 
PoliticalDiscussion,See but what you are doing is also a common  diversionary tactic   digression  Yes the title is bad But the argument he makes for the problem of using this rhetoric is its literal definition  Obama is destroying the constitution is common enough as a rhetorical statement that him using it in the title is a non issue Criticizing him on the title instead of the issue is a digression 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And the people who run the corporations along with the employees all pay taxes so don t tax the corporations Right  Wrong Tax the corporations in return for all the benefits we give them   gt They are allowed thanks to Citizens United and the Supreme Court They pay taxes so they have rights   Yes that s what I disagree with the specific rights that were given to them   gt Privileges and protections including free speech yes  I disagree with a corporation being protected under  free speech  The individuals are protected why does the corporation itself need protection   gt It s the people who believe whatever bullshit comes on their TV Why don t you hold them accountable for once  Just because I think the ridiculous amount of money in politics is stupid does not mean I don t hold people accountable It means I realize there are multiple factors that influence things   gt The Super PACs and corporate influence in politics etc are merely symptomatic Knock one down and another pops up right in its place   Easily solvable by switching to a public funding system The point is right now the system makes it so the person with the most money gets to speak the loudest which is fucking stupid   gt because the fundamental problem is that ordinary people a don t give a shit and or b are fucking stupid  Right But we have a democracy which means that those ordinary people are going to vote Thus it s in all of our best interest to change the situation so that politics aren t so beholden the money and personal corrupt interests 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt People are free to say what they want but must face the consequences when they lie    LOL    gt Stop protecting the poison that is ripping this country apart We would of never invaded Iraq if it were not for Fox news  Fox News is the most popular cable news network People demand it They love what the network puts out The problem is not Fox News it s the people you simple fucking fool 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You are claiming that if we don t give them rights as persons then they will refuse to pay taxes and vice versa  No I never said that I said if you don t give them rights as persons then you have no right to tax them   gt The people who run the corporation along with the employees etc all can vote and have representation We aren t giving corporations the right to vote  And the people who run the corporations along with the employees all pay taxes so don t tax the corporations Right   gt They just aren t allowed to use the legal protection that the corporate entity gives them in order to exercise their rights  They are allowed thanks to Citizens United and the Supreme Court They pay taxes so they have rights   gt Of course there is corporations get tons of benefits just for being a corporation They are bestowed certain privileges and protections for the people who run it  Privileges and protections including free speech yes   gt Have you not seen what Citizen s United and Super PACs have done to the state of elections in this counry  At the end of the day elections are decided by a vote People don t have to believe what they see in a TV ad Don t you get it It s the people It s the people who make FOX the most popular cable news network It s the people who support religious nuts like Santorum It s the people who believe whatever bullshit comes on their TV Why don t you hold them accountable for once The Super PACs and corporate influence in politics etc are merely symptomatic Knock one down and another pops up right in its place because the fundamental problem is that   ordinary people  a don t give a shit and or b are fucking stupid 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you ever been in line at the DMV and thought  Man this is a model of modern efficiency this line moves so much quicker than the checkout lines at Target or Costco   Have you ever dealt with Medicare in any way    I do not have documentation but there s one question I ve learned to ask before someone wants a new law How did we do it before    So you get taxed at X   An X tax rate is supposed to pay for the government  The government should spend to a budget within X   Then people weasel pay raises beyond inflation  because X would increase accordingly with inflation and we have to have X raised higher    Now take welfare as an example but it works with other government agencies  Let s say I m a basic manager and I have a basic manager s salary  I get paid by how many people I give welfare to  not a  of how little waste I have  and how many people I have working under me  So I try to get as many people working under me as possible so I hire as many people as I can and don t demand a high work pace from them  When my review comes around I say  Look how many people I oversee give me more money  The end result of a program like this is to spend a lot more money  I don t have written documentation handy  I m not a welfare fraud investigator but I bet if I were I d be a lot better than the one s they currently have  but it s rampant and part of just about every government agency    Now to get back to your X   We re still paying X  and we ve seen great lay offs in the last few years  The amount government has received has lessened  So even before the depression we had too many people after the depression we still have too many people    Are you trying to tell me that government is efficient  Has anyone ever said  Moves at the speed of government to describe an Enzo  
PoliticalDiscussion,Look what I was saying was not that we shouldn t be disturbed but that we shouldn t be  especially concerned from a Constitutional perspective that it s American citizens being killed the document applies to everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,I never asserted we should abolish the first amendment People are free to say what they want but must face the consequences when they lie   Reenact the Fairness Doctrine Stop protecting the poison that is ripping this country apart We would of never invaded Iraq if it were not for Fox news They will also be responsible for coming war with Iran  
PoliticalDiscussion,You out argue no one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Jefferson expected a constitutional convention every few decades 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anyone is more informed than Fox News viewers that s nothing to brag about and being informed isn t the same thing as having good solutions If you think abolishing the first amendment in favor of state censorship of private news organizations is a good solution then even Fox News viewers are ahead of you in that sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,Vehicular and motorized transport Unwarranted seizures and searches are largely for your personal space the supreme court has set that precedent If its not in your home or car it can be searched Especially if you re getting on a plane 
PoliticalDiscussion,Racism is definitely on the rise in some parts of the world especially in the middle east and europe 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What is normal or not normal in other countries doesn t matter  Of course it matters You are claiming that if we don t give them rights as persons then they will refuse to pay taxes and vice versa I showed you that it works fine in other countries businesses aren t given personhood and yet still pay taxes thus your point is wrong   gt Taxation without representation is theft If you re going to tax a corporation it must have representation rights etc  The people who run the corporation along with the employees etc all can vote and have representation We aren t giving corporations the right to vote   gt Corporations are collectives of people and the rights of the individuals survive the collection If each individual within the collective has freedom of speech everyone within the collective together  i e the collective has freedom of speech  I don t disagree with you there However saying that the corporation itself does not have free speech does not infringe whatsoever on the individual rights of the individual people They just aren t allowed to use the legal protection that the corporate entity gives them in order to exercise their rights   gt Each individual is already taxed there is no reason to tax them again as a collective  Of course there is corporations get tons of benefits just for being a corporation They are bestowed certain privileges and protections for the people who run it Thus there is no problem with them being taxed   gt It must be consistent the Supreme Court has made it consistent and as a voter I will oppose any candidate or ideology which aims to make it inconsistent  And I still don t believe that taxing a corporation and not giving it rights in and of itself is inconsistent We are not infringing nor removing the individual rights of each individual in the collection nor their rights as a group I just do not want to bestow special rights to the legal entity which represents the group by allowing people to use the extra power and influence that a corporation has in order to influence elections unduly Have you not seen what Citizen s United and Super PACs have done to the state of elections in this counry It s ridiculous 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Should we take children away from parents who swear around them because some people find swearing a disgusting habit What about interracial couples Should we revert back to the mindset of the  s and revoke all marriages between a white and a black because some people are racist I m just not seeing your point  Well my point is not to deprive people of their rights on principle but when it conflicts with the health and well being of society it is much more beneficial to the country to let a few peoples rights slip away so the whole can be healthier Would I ban interracial marriages swearing or other things that you mentioned in my society No Would I think that a separate society who does ban these things is wrong because I don t agree with it Also no    gt You think that small mindedness and ignorance of cultures besides your own breeds community  No Where did I ever say this I don t agree with this viewpoint at all You re focusing on negatives here that don t really correlate with what I was saying How does a homogenous culture automatically insinuate that they are ignorant small minded They would just be a culture of people who reached a consensus concerning societal rules  whether you think that s  small minded is your opinion only Remember this quote  Don t be SO open minded that your brain falls out     gt This is a country that is shared between people of all faiths and creeds all races and damn near all ethnicities That is a fact that will not go away any time soon Therefore the only logical thing to do is to learn to live together and function as a community   Therein lies the problem America in particular has no set  ethnicity or unified culture We sort of did at one time but that is no longer the case You cannot expect someone from Russia to automatically get along with someone from Uganda They are two different worlds apart Perhaps some cultures can learn to live together peacefully but there will always be differences and hostilities just based on culture  for instance many Greeks and Turks are not fond of each other I should know my father s side of the family is Greek and he constantly badmouths Turkey  I don t think that the USA is going to succeed given the way things are going Too many cultures  too much conflict of interest    gt If someone wants to leave the country and start their own all white nation or all straight nation or all gay nation they re free to do so but its not going to happen here nor should anyone try   Why shouldn t they try Why shouldn t they be allowed to form their own society I d love to see a world where all cultures peoples had their own country and the world was unified by a respect of each others cultures Idealist perhaps but I think it would work well   gt Are you really insinuating that it s more important to protect anyone from ever being offended or uncomfortable is more important than protecting the freedom of citizens to move about the country freely and feel safe wherever they settle  No I was responding to your flippant comment of  suck it up  I m sure the people who lived in once prosperous Detroit had to  suck it up before that area got consumed with crime and went down the shitter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but corporations whose products I buy are corrupt the political system that I don t participate in doesn t represent me enough I have to pay back the money I borrowed to go to an expensive private college and there is no job waiting for me in the obscure field that I chose randomly as my college major Must be the destructive nature of the baby boomers  s
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you are confusing  the self selected politicians with  baby boomers    Every generation in history has had power hungry people who go about making a mess while the rest of us are unwilling to die or put our lives on hold to stop them   The current generation is no different in that respect   you will all eventually get jobs houses families and just try to minimize the impact of those who crave power 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t understand that kelustu and I have a history Go see the rest of our conversation He tends to get a bit more nasty than me Also not as smart as me 
PoliticalDiscussion, Part  D for  Defective  The Medicare Drug Benefit Chaos      In many cases the program worsened patients situations with a particularly heavy burden falling on indigent Medicaid enrollees Before the new entitlement most had virtually all their medications covered fully by the states But on January   million of these vulnerable elderly were reassigned to one of the private insurance companies designated by Medicare to run its program Word of these arrangements didn t always reach the patients insurers or pharmacies accurately and tens of thousands of indigent patients were told to get prior authorization pay a large initial deductible or make substantial copayments for regularly used medicines they previously received at no cost Thousands discovered that the drugs they had been taking for years were not covered by their new insurers Clinical crises ensued and  states had to provide emergency payments for frail citizens     It is just as bad as ObamaCare A hand out to insurance companies    
PoliticalDiscussion,Drawings from the list of Social Security Numbers   Draw  million then draw  million then  million and so on until you get to   Have those  run off against each other in an election   
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only if you surgically implanted a bomb in his chest that would explode after  years   
PoliticalDiscussion,No kidding I m pretty glad I m not growing up with  Soviet nukes pointed at my head 
PoliticalDiscussion,Daily show viewers are more informed than fox viewers         The results show us that there is something about watching Fox News that leads people to do worse on these questions than those who don t watch any news at all  said Dan Cassino a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson      Sorry Fox News The Daily Show s Viewers Are More Informed Than Yours   ixzzpfITGSR   
PoliticalDiscussion,Not to be a dick to the OP but I totally agree with you and got the exact same feeling reading his post I m pretty sure grave robbings and polio deaths are at an all time low right now to use two of countless examples Use some perspective 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think a lot of generations have left the world in a worse state than when they found it 
PoliticalDiscussion,you re kidding right I m not a baby boomer but my generation   s are at least as destructive any one before us We are just chomping at the bit to do our damage   If you are looking at this from a youthful sheltered provided for life then perhaps you should think about our st world inner cities and the homicide rates in places like  Detroit     we may be socially more liberal which is fine but we will be just as destructive And if we aren t  in the st world the unwashed millions from the rest of the world will come to dominate and destroy    
PoliticalDiscussion,Check this documentary out    To me it seems that our parents  also in late ies or many of them decided to trade security against freedom But what they don t know is that there s no security and now there s also no freedom left Specially after   This is for me far worse than economic crisis etc  You are also saying that this people should fuck off Why Why would they They have a comfortable house don t have any financial problems and probably they have some kids to inherit them They will want to hang on on this until someone beats the shit out of them Or have you seen a bully go away just because you asked him nicely or because everybody agrees he should go He will only go away when he sees he s fucked So we have an elitarian class hanging on their old kingdoms oppressing everything they can and we have an growing amount of people being pissed off What could go wrong But I say I wouldn t like to witness a revolution at least not a bloody one I would prefer to solve this like adults But I don t know how  
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you ever left your own country 
PoliticalDiscussion,Evidence  Or is this just a totally unfounded guess on your part 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah willful ignorance and nostalgia make such a heady concoction  You make the mistake of assuming that when this batch of leaders in their  s and  s retire they will be replaced by people in their  s and  s and that is just not the case  They will be replaced by people in their  s and  s who will be almost functionally identical to the previous as the current were almost functionally identical to the previous generation  You also make the mistake of assuming that the current dip is the new trend  Unless the world ends soon december  we will have a period of slow growth but we will eventually get pass it to a period of fast growth   look at the  s  s  s  s  s  s  s  s    
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually  we did our legal representative made that decision for us  Don t get me wrong the act was a horrible crime made more horrible by representing us Our courts will try him and they will be military courts 
PoliticalDiscussion,No declared war but I m betting those soldiers aren t there on an afghan vista Its not the same as if you flew there as a tourist went through their customs and are subject to heir laws and courts 
PoliticalDiscussion,The supreme court is the highest court in our land We are constitutionally unable to recognize the international court as anything other than an opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ahhh but which person shall we choose As a conservative I would not have had any recent Republican in that position  Obama certainly isn t the man for the job  I d be ok with me but I doubt you would so we are back to something with elections term limits checks and balances and mitigated damage   Something like what we have 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if you re going to argue the route of benevolent dictator I suggest using  Cincinnatus   as your ancient Roman example Caesar is a little  too dictatorial for most people s palates these days 
PoliticalDiscussion,Life changes things  I remember when I was in my  s Earth Day the end of the Vietnam War  Women s Rights Civil Rights then it all went to shit   The corporations fought back    It s time to take up the fight again  but until you we reverse the decision made under Citizen s United the war will not be won   
PoliticalDiscussion,Thomas Jefferson was not a delegate at the Constitutional Convention He was serving as Minister to France at the time Also the Convention itself was a bit of a power seizure considering it was basically treason against the government of the Articles of Confederation once they decided they had no intention of keeping that government around  You would really do well to contextualize your understanding of the Constitutional Convention in the frame of moving away from the Articles of Confederation 
PoliticalDiscussion,oh they may try but they re really just a sad little imitator
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed  It would hamstring all future Presidents  The proper approach is to motivate Congress or the Judiciary or the States  Also I will point out that most people on here are missing a very obvious difference between GWB and Obama  GWB s alleged violations were standard for wartime and were in accordance w  acts of Congress  e g  disagree w  the Patriot Act but do not ignore that it was passed by Congress and in overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion   Obama in many instances has ignored the mandates of Congress and has gone beyond the standard use of force during wartime  All of the examples I posted above were things solely w in Obama s control  I don t blame Presidents alone for things Congress authorizes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Calling people  slimy pieces of shit isn t a very good discussion tactic 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Constitution should not be limited to one man s linguistic analysis of its structure    The United States people are rightfully troubled by a sitting President deciding unilaterally to order the death of a United States citizen  The United States people are also rightfully troubled by a sitting President s DOJ disregarding federal law to permit and encourage illegal gun sales and then campaigning on the ensuing violence as justification for further gun restrictions  The War on Terror is long drawn out  It is natural and necessary for the United States people to be concerned that shortcuts around the law can become accepted  i e that the federal gov t deciding it is justified in some instances of murdering citizens will continue to do so   This concern existed even as far back as the founding  All of the Due Process and criminal trial protections in the Constitution exist b c history provided numerous examples of gov t abuse and unjustified assertion of power  Those protections were put in place purposefully to ensure that the federal gov t would always be required to justify its use of force  i e to protect the people   The federal gov t is now claiming that it is exempted in some instances of going through the proper procedure of not recognizing those protections  That the drone strike targets are United States citizens is not irrelevant to the conversation  Being a United States citizen is never irrelevant  The Second Amendment prohibits gov t from denying citizenry the freedom to own use firearms  People disagree w  the intention and wording of the Second Amendment constantly  largely due to SCOTUS allowing Congress to overly expand the Commerce Clause and to the messy process of Incorporation  but nobody argues that consistent with the Second Amendment the federal gov t should be involved in making decisions on who can and cannot own firearms  Regardless it is  The federal gov t disregarded federal law and provided firearms to persons it knew would be using the weapons for violence  The federal gov t then intervened further into the public dialogue to speak out against guns  EDIT Wording in  The War on Terror paragraph  Also one good way to look at the drone strikes is the writ of habeas corpus  The Constitution expressly forbids the federal gov t from disregarding the writ unless Congress authorizes it to do so  The Constitution recognizes that there may be war or other exigent circumstances which permit the federal gov t acting outside its usual power but requires that Congress a more diverse and representative body make the determination  If Obama truly believes the drone strikes are essential it would be in line w  our constitutional history for him to request permission to create a national debate 
PoliticalDiscussion, Disagree on IV TSA searches don t break the constitution There are plenty of legitimate forms of travel that are not airlines   While alternatives under the strictest definition exist I don t think that substantiates what TSA has done Name to me a reasonable alternative for international airline travel to travel accross the world say to India Not that this matters much because TSA as I understand it plans on expanding the scope of it s  services to a wider theater including trains and bus terminals   When and if it uses the same methods in these places would you make the same argument But there is always walking to Russia as an alternative and hey theoretically you could get to India by walking up to alaska and swimming the strait to Kamchatka So there is an alternative available So it is ok if they demand to cup your balls or artificially target your  attractive  year old daughter or  year child for  expanded search  TSA agents with little or no training are enabled to do things that would summarily label you a child molester abuser in any other situation All this supposedly because these people are legitimate threats despite all analysis pointing to us being no safer than before under TSA   In the strictest anal terms what you said might be accurate but that doesn t mean it is ok or right and any legal system that allows or motivates such behavior is abhorrent to any sense of human dignity and fly against the spirit if not the exact wording that embodies the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama has been far worse than GWB  He has overwhelmingly continued the acts GWB did and added to the mix substantially  While GWB was in office especially during his second term I literally heard  Hitler coming out of the media or a liberal march every week  Now it is much much quieter  The hypocrisy is stunning 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks a million I hope they finally find wisdom and mind there own business or at least things that matter 
PoliticalDiscussion,For minorities women and other marginalized groups shit has gotten a lot better Maybe not everyone can go out and buy a house with a picket fence but some of us can live our lives without fear of being sexually harassed on a daily basis or for some people killed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with you I don t know why the United States is backing this resolution I m glad your government was able to crush the Tigers I hope there is no investigation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wrote that comment  before the OP edited and expanded the post text 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What if the people all threw their support to one man  If everyone was in agreement they could easily elect a new government under our current system So many  young people seem to think that the problem is the system The problem isn t the system We have a democratic system of electing officials We have freedom of speech that we can use to publish and distribute information We have all the tools necessary for reform laid out right in front of us    The problem is nobody is using them because most people don t give a shit   The problem is the people You will never see major reform without the cooperation of the majority of people and any country where that happens has an oppressive government which imposes its own view of righteousness on the masses because it thinks it knows better  There are no easy solutions 
PoliticalDiscussion,that would be so brave
PoliticalDiscussion,Damn you re so edgy and cool Just fuck everything  Right    gt A corporation should not be able to willfully lie and hide behind the fucking First Amendment  Yeah Fuck that Amendment What a piece of shit Also children shouldn t get cancer Which fucking amendment can we blame that on    gt And fuck Rupert Murdoch too  Yeah fuck that guy When I recognize a problem I say  fuck that thing  And then it goes away Because I m young and that s how I roll 
PoliticalDiscussion,  RICH CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE POOR  IGNORANCE CONTINUES TO FUEL POLITICAL AMBIVALENCE  
PoliticalDiscussion,Another brilliant idea from a naive  something Sorry I know I m being a dick but your worldview is just  so incredibly simple it s literally dangerous Jon Stewart is a really funny guy but as good as he is at making fun of stuff he doesn t have any answers He has pretty much created an entire generation of young people who believe that everything is messed up but have absolutely no clue how to solve any of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your post is full of vague generalities   gt The Middle East and Africa are suffering through brutal atrocities   gt South America remains corrupt   gt everything is extremely unstable right now   gt economies are in a terrible state   gt the rich keep getting richer       gt Greed ignorance corruption ego and myopic thinking have put our global world in a very uncertain state   Our global world     gt I am in my late  s  I m not trying to be a dick but it is really obvious by how you write and what you re saying You re disillusioned and you think it s all older peoples fault You think you know how the world works and you think you ve found the answers   gt We have a more worldly view more tolerance and polls in the West have revealed that we value time over money much more than our parents do  What is a  more worldly view  What  polls in the West are you talking about Again vague generalities 
PoliticalDiscussion,Define world peace Because I think we are pretty much already there for all practical purposes  I think nuclear weapons have solved  of the problem of world peace We likely won t see another world war because of them The other  is the little wars that happen from time to time Given that there are  billion of us and just  people created a massive shitstorm in the last decade that caused at least two of those little wars it isn t feasible to completely eliminate all forms of state and non state violence  Just be happy with what you have You are generally safe from war in the vast majority of places on Earth The other places will hopefully gradually evolve to be more peaceful as they industrialize and become richer  wealth tends to make people not want to pick up a gun and die for a cause   
PoliticalDiscussion,When I went into the bathroom at walmart earlier I am pretty sure it was not a baby boomer that etched swastikas into the door The baby boomers fought the climax of the civil rights movement and were also the generation that protested so hard against the Vietnam war    gt The baby boomer generation will be the first to leave the world in a worse state than they inherited  So you are saying that you would prefer the medical technology racism sexism and political state on the verge of nuclear war as it was before they took over to the modern world How are things worse than they were  years ago  You know how you keep complaining about how shitty the world is Realize that before the baby boomers took over citizens were regularly detained for being suspected of communism Japanese were tortured simply for being the wrong race at the wrong time The world had recently finished its first nuclear war in which  million Jews were killed Is that the glorious world you wish to return to 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the world is any more messed up now than it was in the past And it is much better than specific eras that caused massive destruction  e g WWI WWII or had the potential to cause massive destruction  e g Berlin blockade Cuban Missile Crisis  And going back further things were much more brutal  e g Mongol invasion Crusades  We ve also done a huge amount in the last few hundred years to reduce disease hunger and ignorance There are definitely problems but I think it is a time to be optimistic  
PoliticalDiscussion,IIRC Foxconn actually has lower suicide rates than other similar factories based in China  You re breaking into a larger issue of whether or not increasing the economic power of a nation and or the nation s peoples can help improve their well being or if it just results in increased economic wealth for a select few  Personally I am of the former persuasion  while not naive enough to dismiss the latter  and I think that outsourcing has helped to increase global productivity per capita material wealth and the general well being of many peoples around the globe    I doubt that the increasing freedoms of those in Russia and China would be possible without increased economic means via outsourcing and global trade  despite the recent crackdowns in said countries they re much better than they were  or  years ago  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes it could  It could also be incredibly disastrous a la Wiemar Germany  I ll take my chance with a democratic republic  even if everyone but me makes the wrong decisions over a benevolent dictatorship any day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,No one is advocating legalization Some advocate decriminalization of marijuana And that s about it Or perhaps I missed Obama s platform about legalizing heroin and making it available at gas stations In fact Obama the DOJ and the Democratic party of California are going after marijuana in California and other states So don t worry your beloved drug war will continue on for many more years to come in the US Both parties support it equally 
PoliticalDiscussion,He can t even win the nomination He d have to get about  of the remaining delegates to win No chance of this happening But he makes a nice sideshow which will make Romney look like a sensible moderate   Leaving the US is fun though   Do it while you re young or you never will 
PoliticalDiscussion,Voltaire would agree with you There have been many enlightened despots and benevolent dictators through the years Many certainly were good for their countries  Arguments have been made that certain Presidents were almost Benevolent dictatorships even like good ol FDR  But the problem with this argument and discussion is that it often focuses on efficiency or the positive effects it might have But that is the wrong discussion to be having Democracy isn t our government of choice because it s particularly efficient or because it is the best form of government It s because it s the least open to abuse  I know right But others are worse  and because well   it s  fair  People don t like to be told what to do If you don t give them the right to choose to do something that s bad for them then they get all riled up   Even if you had a truly benevolent dictatorship that always did the best for its citizens you d have massive rebellions But that s an unrealistic situation as what s best is often not particularly clear cut Often times someone has to get screwed over for someone else to do well It s a lot easier to get people to swallow that when you allow them to believe they can change that 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the world is steadily getting better as the radio isotope levels in the earth s core decrease    s  Society changes but such change does not necessarily rely on the turnover of people  For example new technologies change peoples perceptions within their own lifetimes  A similar argument could be made for new ideas practices as well  What I ve been exposed to here on Reddit has helped make me a more well rounded individual with much more exposure to opposing  or just different viewpoints than I otherwise would ve had and I m still alive  Edit  To address your edit I wouldn t worry about the short term fluctuations of the standard of living nor would I look at what  dollar  hour s worth of labor would buy average Joe in  vs  either and I ll explain why  It s commonly known that during the  s the wage was higher in terms of what you could buy for your time spent laboring than what it is today at least on the global stage  What isn t taken into account is how buying a Toyota Corolla today is a much better value  at least in an economic non collector sense than a  s Mustang  Likewise I would rather take the most terrible computer on the common market today over the most powerful computer in the  s    You might say well of course I ll take newer better technologies but what about basic needs like foodstuffs  Starting in  flour began to be enriched with niacin to help combat deficiencies  google  pellagra   so once again it s not really ever an apples to apples comparison due to the fact that humans constantly improve upon existing technologies methods and applications  Are there real issues  Sure there are  Do we experience short term fluctuations with people facing real income problems which may make life for them harder than for their parents  Of course  It is ridiculous however to state that on the whole our standard of living is declining because we ve had a few bad years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Baby boomers  the worst generation ever thus far raised the millennials  AKA you OP   You have no idea how horrible things are going to get 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the world is steadily getting better as the older generations die off  The standard of living in the US however is dropping 
PoliticalDiscussion,But we do limit other freedoms to prevent serious harms Even with freedom of speech I can t claim that I know my neighbor is banging  year olds Even with freedom of religion I can t sacrifice children I would say that blatant lies about the news could be a serious harm Now whether or not that s true is debatable but I think it at least does warrant debate 
PoliticalDiscussion,My question to you When  hasn t the world been a mess Right now life expectancy is higher comparatively fewer wars are going on the world s population on the whole is more educated and healthier technology is progressing at lightning speed And the sheer ability to connect with anybody anywhere across the world has really transformed what it means to be human tearing down people s preconceived notions of those unlike them   Yeah the citizens of China have it bad   but compared to where they were  years ago they re lightyears ahead There s at least a decent standard of living and though they are still limited there is a higher level of free speech that is tolerated     Of course this world is far from perfect There are a lot of atrocities and terrible things going on But I d still take the world of  over just about any other period in recent human history  not gonna lie though the dark ages would have been pretty sweet    It s all relative is what I m saying   we can t always compare things against ideals   And for the love of God can we stop using antiquated terms like  First World   
PoliticalDiscussion, The problem comes down to this Old fucks vote Baby boomers are gonna start dying off in droves and that s a good thing   Stanhope
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think anyone can deny that our world is a mess right now  Has there really ever been a time in the history of humanity where things weren t a mess 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like your brave stand for dictatorship but my first questions are what corporate government corruption    gt I can not help but think of the days of the stagnating Roman Republic and how much Caesar helped to hold it together He was not seen as a tyrant but as a Liberator  It s always good to look at the whole of history and how Caesar set Rome up for its downfall Having the dictatorship leads to a strong country with a strong leader and a weak one with a weak leader 
PoliticalDiscussion,You need new friends  Even in this tough times comparatively  with thousands of years of human existence things are pretty good in america  You are the  of human existence 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But what if you re cornered in an alley   can t get past your questioner Can you hit them then  Is your life being threatened  Then no  You always let them make the first move  Try and walk past them if they stop and lay hands on you   then you can hit them    Of course this is hypothetical and not related to the case at hand   gt Yes this is speculation But Zimmerman s  I got out of my truck to read a street sign   was attacked from behind is just his version of things too  Of course  And with no other witnesses this is how it happened  Unless some other evidence comes up   gt I just google mapped  Retreat View Circle Sanford FL There are three potential street names in that gated community It would be unusual if a man who had been neighborhood watching there for over a year couldn t figure out what street he was on wouldn t it  Maybe he got out of the vehicle to get a better look at where the suspect was  Again     speculation    You weren t there neither was I  We can sit here and google map and play armchair detective but we don t know shit about shit   gt Details are sketchy I hope that this gets investigated further  It s going to a Grand Jury it will be investigated by both sides  But unless there is some evidence we don t know about then Zimmerman may still go free 
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t read that from a witness report only from Ofcr Lee s statement of what Zimmerman said to the police 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Romney is president 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was gonna put a tl dr but reading is essential to critical thought  Thanks for reading it 
PoliticalDiscussion,But what if you re cornered in an alley   can t get past your questioner  Can you hit them then   Yes this is speculation  But Zimmerman s  I got out of my truck to read a street sign   was attacked from behind is just his version of things too  I just google mapped  Retreat View Circle Sanford FL  There are three potential street names in that gated community  It would be unusual if a man who had been neighborhood watching there for over a year couldn t figure out what street he was on wouldn t it    Details are sketchy  I hope that this gets investigated further  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sounds better than most of the presidential nominees but no one I d gladly hand supreme executive power too  That makes no sense  You re already willing to give power to the nominees incumbent but not people who are better than most them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hence why this is a bad idea all around   
PoliticalDiscussion,This would appear to jive with the recent information coming from another witness that Trayvon attacked Zimmerman from behind 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Would the stand your ground laws apply to a person who feels they are being threatened by a man following them through a neighborhood and agressively questioning them perhaps cornering them in an alley   No  Aggressively questioning   a threat on your life   Remember Trayvon went down the alley first to elude Zimmerman making a suspicious person look   more  suspicious not less  But then again   the details are sketchy    We ve also been hearing now how Trayvon attacked Zimmerman from behind   if you re trying to get away from someone why hit from behind     gt If a person was in that kind of situation   threw a punch in self defense in order to gain themselves time to retreat to safety would that first punch count as an initiation of an assault  Yes  Being queried is not a threat on your life  But then again the details are   sketchy   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s commonly known that during the  s the wage was higher in terms of what you could buy for your time spent laboring than what it is today  This is actually not true  Hourly real compensation has more than doubled since the s   
PoliticalDiscussion,I am hopeful as well  I think the internet is an incredible resource for young people to educate and organize themselves as we ve seen in the Arab Spring  However I m also worried because whenever I bring it up in conversations with my parents they always say  yeah that s what we thought to   as in they thought the world would be better once their generation got into power as well   So I m not sure what to think 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The standard of living in the US however is dropping   By what measure Americans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world and the highest at any point in American history How many people had flat screen TVs and cell phones twenty years ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,Poor kid probably thought he was being kidnapped Creep in car was  watching him maybe slowly following him Kid notices this and picks up the pace Creep gets out of car and pursues then apparently grabs the kid   It was the kid who was acting in self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re making the same mistake  of Redditors and the Media is presuming guilt  The second you do this the rest of the analysis is flawed  I m not saying he is definitely NOT guilty but that there is no evidence of it at this time   gt Well you are right that we have to take Zimmerman at his word To me though  and just my opinion the story doesn t pass the smell test   What smell test  Just because something sounds fishy doesn t mean you can act on it  You need more information which is still unavailable or may never come up   gt First Zimmerman called  which should have been it Then the operator tells him to stay put   But this isn t illegal  You don t have to follow  if you think you re better off  They re in an air conditioned call center miles away they will advise you to do whatever covers  their asses  Not yours  Zimmerman  supposedly exited the vehicle to determine which street Trayvon was walking down and was  supposedly attacked from behind     gt Zimmerman then exits the vehicle  which is much safer than out in the open if he truly did feel threatened and guns an unarmed kid down     and STOP  A lot could have happened between  exiting the vehicle and  guns an unarmed kid down   Not to mention that the fact that Trayvon being armed or not makes no difference  People can kill with their fists just as well as a gun    Also By phrasing it this way you are entertaining the fallacy that Trayvon was the victim which is not an impartial POV    The trick here is to remain impartial and try and view things from every angle  This is what Detectives Forensics folks Lawyers etc do  Be like them and not like the angry masses who made their judgement on impartial information   gt And although race should not matter it does Saying it does not matter does not mean that white privilege does not exist I benefit from it daily whether I want to or not  Except Zimmerman is a Latino is he not  Of Cuban descent  Wouldn t this make him a minority as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is he d then either strive to make the world a better place before he dies or just fuck everything up as much as possible  What does he care he s going to die anyway  Kind of a gamble don t you think 
PoliticalDiscussion,i didn t say i would do that personally i said i would do that if it was my family that was massacred  i m not saying it s more  useful  i m saying that s exactly what will happen the survivors will retaliate 
PoliticalDiscussion,let s see that ll yield us approximately   day laborers  one working odd jobs the other currently out of work   stay at home parents  women  man   unemployed fine arts graduates   sales representatives  and  middle manager  Sounds better than most of the presidential nominees but no one I d gladly hand supreme executive power too 
PoliticalDiscussion,I bet  There are plenty who have judged him guilty without pause and are willing to kill him now 
PoliticalDiscussion,We ought to sue congress and have the supreme court declare the wars unconstitutional No one would be tried for war crimes because they had the mandate of the people but Bush would be stripped of the title of President for the crime of lying misleading the people congress into an unjust war and Obama would be impeached immediately for his many breaches of the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry but that is literally false I out argue most people I debate Turns out I was in debate and had a winning record Maybe that is why I stay on topic and not just call people nasty names You are so good at arguing kelustu probably the best I ve ever seen    You are wrong I m right and you are a fucking retard Kelustu
PoliticalDiscussion,The officer who originally arrived on the scene noted cuts to Zimmerman s nose and the back of his head He was also covered in grass as it appears they tussled on the grass But there s a lot of evidence I m sure isn t public 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would the stand your ground laws apply to a person who feels they are being threatened by a man following them through a neighborhood and agressively questioning them perhaps cornering them in an alley  If a person was in that kind of situation   threw a punch in self defense in order to gain themselves time to retreat to safety would that first punch count as an initiation of an assault  
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman doesn t have to prove that his story is true burden of proof is on the prosecution And I don t know how  they will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his story is false If I were taking bets right now I put good money on him getting off scott free because of this idiotic law 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just a drop in the ocean compared to Fox news girls complaining about the  Liberal media    one way much 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks that article was interesting It will be interesting to see how the growing middle class in China affects the politics of the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well you are right that we have to take Zimmerman at his word To me though  and just my opinion the story doesn t pass the smell test First Zimmerman called  which should have been it Then the operator tells him to stay put Zimmerman then exits the vehicle  which is much safer than out in the open if he truly did feel threatened and guns an unarmed kid down To me that says that Zimmerman put himself in a dangerous situation To me it s like if he were to run a red light and kill a pedestrian for jay walking Yes the pedestrian was breaking a law but the driver does not need to take matters into their own hands   And although race should not matter it does Saying it does not matter does not mean that white privilege does not exist I benefit from it daily whether I want to or not   Anyways these are just my thoughts on the subject I appreciate the polite discourse 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s got to be pretty frightening for him   his family  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes yes we all know you don t like Fox News OP we get it You can stop posting about it now Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,The odds of finding a candidate who would have pure intentions are slim to nil 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you are arguing against income redistribution  It seems to me that there is an element of self interest in arguing for a safety net  I might be that poor someday for one thing  For two if you mistreat people badly enough they mistreat you back  See the riots in France as an example  
PoliticalDiscussion,Except the government already  does do so Seriously it does Try printing fake quotes and watch yourself get sued Try claiming you re an official government agency and see what happens 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But if may play devil s advocate for a minute we don t know the real story of what Trayvon did only what was pieced together through the crime scene and what Zimmerman said  Correct  Without any supporting physical evidence or witnesses to the contrary then we must accept Zimmerman s story     gt I know Florida has some very lenient self defense laws but I do think that Zimmerman should have seen some jail time for this  Why  According to his story Trayvon initiated the assault and had Zimmerman on the ground  Zimmerman may have suffered serious injury or even death if he didn t defend himself which is why the law exists  Unless there is evidence to the contrary this is the narrative that currently fits   gt I ve said this before but do you think if it would have been Trayvon that killed Zimmerman that Trayvon would be a free man right now  Does  Not  Matter   Dealing with questions like these leads nowhere in this case  Are we to punish Zimmerman for a supposed slight against a different minority in a different case  Two wrongs don t make a right 
PoliticalDiscussion,But if may play devil s advocate for a minute we don t know the real story of what Trayvon did only what was pieced together through the crime scene and what Zimmerman said  I know Florida has some very lenient self defense laws but I do think that Zimmerman should have seen some jail time for this  I ve said this before but do you think if it would have been Trayvon that killed Zimmerman that Trayvon would be a free man right now  
PoliticalDiscussion,I stated it in a different reply to you but the evidence is pretty flimsy  The most damning would ve come from the autopsy of Trayvon and photographs of the crime scene  You have Zimmerman s story and details now see if it matches up with the physical evidence     Where was Trayvon shot    How many times was he hit    How many shots were fired  How close was the weapon to Trayvon when the weapon fired   Are there cuts bruises on Trayvon s body suggesting a physical confrontation  Are there cuts bruises on Zimmerman s body  They had a   fight    Surely there must be some evidence of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree That s the point I was trying to bring up in starting this post What really is the hard evidence against Zimmerman outside all of the emotion about the case I said that I hate to think about him getting off as I believe this has the potential to set off a pretty massive race riot 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt By exiting his car does that not mean that he realistically throws out any chance at reasonable self defense   Nope  It casts doubt on the claim but then again it s  his neighborhood and Trayvon is the purported intruder  In his mind this person was up to no good hooded and ran onto private property by going between homes  Maybe Trayvon thinking he was threatened waited in ambush for Zimmerman and attacked    IMO this is a tragedy due to mis cues on both involved  Zimmerman thinking Trayvon was a threat and Trayvon thinking Zimmerman was a threat  Neither wanted to back down from those assertions and one is dead 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trayvon would be unjustified in fighting someone without provocation  You can t throw a punch at someone because they are following you or look suspicious any more than you can shoot them for doing the same   gt As much as I hate it I have a feeling the guy might get off the Murder charges Perhaps Manslaughter The one thing that no one wants to think about is the chance that he may just get off all together     and if he does  So what  We don t run a justice system based on  hypotheticals or what things  appear to be   We run it based on conclusive evidence  It s why OJ walked free and is the same if Zimmerman walks 
PoliticalDiscussion,He better be in hiding a bunch of self aggrandizing vigilantes are gunning for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,It didn t abide by the nato treaty in  any way and  handing it over to Nato does not negate the constitutional requirements of the President of the United States  Libya was an  actual illegal war Just like your justifications are  actual lies and hypocrisy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Completely agree Stand your ground doesn t apply when you chase after someone just because they look suspicious  to you  
PoliticalDiscussion,Good points but the Economist is not Fox news which happens to be the largest demo of TV viewership so effectively Fox is the GOP for all intents and purposes most Republicans get their  news  how to think from Fox not other publications 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s counter intuitive but it s absolutely true  and not in the sense you were asking  I like  Paul Krugman s analysis   from way back in  Even if outsourced labor jobs pay next to nothing in China they re the sort of jobs that dramatically improve the Chinese standard of living and will eventually elevate China into being a middle income country Capitalism happens workers get exploited and yet those exploited workers end up being much better off a few years or decades later 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are plenty of news organizations that offer good critical coverage  The Economist is right of center and will often come out against Republican politicians for example  Who cares if a particular news organization is playing for Team Republican or Team Democrat Use your dollar vote and watch read something else 
PoliticalDiscussion,yep agreed
PoliticalDiscussion,Nah He d have to win every remaining primary by large margins to pick up enough delegates to win I suppose it s mathematically possible for him to still be the  R nominee but that s like saying space aliens could kill us all tomorrow  Santorum would lose badly in the general election Not a single swing voter would vote for him It would be a massacre 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the world shared in the prosperity found in the US I m sure it would But a large swath of the world still lives in pre industrialized conditions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Simple the autopsy would prove a lot   Bruises Scratches on both Zimmerman and Trayvon would be examined  Location of bullet wound s  Was the shot in the head  Was it at close range  Powder burns  Position of Trayvon when shot  Was he on top  On bottom  Was he standing  The facts we have are the following   Zimmerman called the police first reported a suspicious person disregarded police instructions to not follow the person   During the incident numerous people called  to report  screaming  but none were willing to observe the crime  At this moment I think there may be   one  eye witness   Trayvon s hands were free  He stuffed his drink and Skittles in his pockets prior to the incident 
PoliticalDiscussion,Caesar was considered a tyrant in many political circles of Rome It s the reason why Caesar s actions precipitated a civil war and why he was assassinated on the senate floor But even if we accept the proposition that he wasn t the consequences of his actions indelibly changed the political structure of Rome in a way that led to tyrants in subsequent generations Tiberius Caligula Nero And these three are just within the first  emperors of Rome   So even if it were effective for the time being to consolidate power in one man it sets a dangerous precedent that could be exploited and have negative impacts for future generations 
PoliticalDiscussion,I realize that humanity has witnessed its dark periods much worse than the world we live in today  However as we advance I would have hoped things would be better than this We have the luxury of technology global communication and maybe most importantly history to look back on 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  operator told him not to follow him He did and shot an unarmed kid He is going to Jail 
PoliticalDiscussion,It didn t necessarily abide by NATO rules but it was handed over to NATO before the unconstitutional  days   
PoliticalDiscussion,Very well put Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is just about the strongest point to be made on the subject Please keep government sponsored  truth off of my media 
PoliticalDiscussion,I advocate legalization Why would you not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox news isn t illegal in Canada as Canada has no jurisdiction over newscasts from other sovereign countries The law just states that newscasts that originate in Canada can t knowingly report falsities It doesn t prevent news from other countries from reaching us 
PoliticalDiscussion,To say the world is a worse place than before is just wrong I appreciate the desire to recognize what is wrong in the world But perspective is required 
PoliticalDiscussion,He hasn t said much of anything yet I m sure under the advice of council to keep his mouth closed as they craft the best defense he can have 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ignorant bullshit As a young person recognizing what is wrong in the world and where it is stemming from is ignorant 
PoliticalDiscussion,Travel is important for perspective  With the exception of nuclear weapons none of the problems we face are unique to our time  These problems will arise again and again in spite of whatever technological advances may come and regardless of whatever shapes our global culture and society take  We humans have short memories  The defining characteristic of our time aside from nuclear power is the ability we have created to record and communicate ideas quickly and to any part of the world  It is the internet  This tool is our modern salvation  It would be pleasant if we could wait and hope for our current officials to fade from existance and memory yet we already live subjugated by our governments  As these few men and women increase their wealth and power more and more of us will feel the weight of oppression  Much of what is already happening took decades to unfold  Nonetheless this is not a time of endings  From my perspective it is a time of rebirth into another Age of Reason  People across the globe are beginning to wake up to the idea that things aren t exactly right  Movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street are the unfolding of our future  Change does not come quickly  It will not be pleasant  It may be the closest thing to hell on earth we as a species will ever experience   Some people benefit from systems which stay the same  People who do not benefit from those systems will nonetheless align themselves with those who do  We will see a great divide in people and we will most likely go to war with each other in some form or another  But as Thomas Paine once wrote  time makes more converts than reason   Eventually people will see the good we can do for ourselves  None of us require an education to know what freedom is  We do not need a degree to know the difference between right and wrong  Even now people are fighting and they are protesting  More importantly they are thinking and talking amongst themselves and with people all over the world    Grow the dialogue if you are truly this upset about it  Keep talking to people and start expanding your reach  If you don t want to join a group or a movement that is perfectly fine  Instead explore the means and methods for change and then direct others toward options which fit their skills  It is easy at a time like this to feel a deep cynicism and profound despair   Who am I and what can I possibly do  seems a common sentiment  It only takes one person s voice to transform people s bitterness and anger into action  Thomas Paine did it with his pamphlet  Common Sense   When you consider the time period and the scope of his audience it is an amazing thing he succeeded  We can reach as many and far more people than he did  Everything that do and the ways we live are things which we have created  We can undo any of it if we wish  We can start again 
PoliticalDiscussion,is Zimmerman saying that they tussled for the gun or anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is ignorant bullshit The world has always been filled to the brim with atrocities and it s hard to argue that it is getting worse By most metrics such as wars violence oppression the world is actually getting better   Blame the baby boomers I blame them for debt and foreign conflicts but in aggregate it is just gals that the world is a worse place today than in  Ask minorities if they would rather live in the s Ask gays single mothers and elderly who had the highest poverty rates of any age group   Is politics worse Look at the second presidential election or  or the politics leading up to the civil war Our country is divided but still not to the extent of past elections s congress was terrible   Leaders do not gain recognition in most cases until they enter the history books We may have a Kennedy or MLK or even eisenhower already in our midst but it will take time to recognize that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m angry that they sit on their asses and push for wars with other nations  e g  Iran and then my peers and classmates are the ones who end up doing the actual fight and dying  Do you honestly think that this is something new or that all boomers and only boomers support our idiotic wars in the middle east   American troops died in Vietnam most of them boomers  That s roughly ten times as many as have died in Iraq and Afghanistan combined  Boomers had the draft and you don t probably because so many of them protested the Vietnam war  If your plan for changing the world is to wait for the older generations to die off well good luck with that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt However as I pointed out our inability to be forward thinking and only focus on the now has caused great instability Not to mention our ability to solve these issues is awful  I don t want to sound overly contrarian but I think everyone s views about pacing of solutions engagement of problems is relative  Some people would say that we need to cut carbon emissions more drastically and others would say we should be more cautious before we dramatically try to change our economy  I m not sure that we aren t forward thinking but rather that we have different opinions on how far forward we should plan for  as circumstances change  or what solutions we propose  Our technical ability and knowledge for solving problems is only increasing so while in some grand cosmic view our ability to solve these issues may seem awful it s leaps and bounds better than earlier in our history 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Went through NATO Technically not unconstitutional  The NATO treaty only authorizes the president to send forces into combat if a NATO country was attacked  Libya attacked no one Libya was attacked  So not only was Obama s involvement unconstitutional the  NATO MADE ME DO IT excuse is a flat out lie purported by hypocrites   gt No Wrong Just factually blatantly at its core wrong  You must be talking about yourself here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman never identified himself to Trayvon how the hell would he know who he is   From NYT  gt At that point Trayvon ran and Mr Zimmerman continued to follow    gt They  Trayvon s parents say they can imagine Trayvon reacting with fright or concern upon seeing a burly stranger trailing him in his car then getting out to follow him  Zimmerman was on the phone with a police dispatcher so if he identified himself the dispatcher would have heard 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure  FACT The Us constitution requires the president to get congressional permission before conducting a war The congress passed the War Powers Act to clarify that the CIC can authorize and direct limited military excursions within  days as long as the CIC notifies congress of what he or she is doing and why he or she is doing it and that the CIC end these hostilities or get permission for them within  days  Now go look up Libya See how the US bombed the shit out of that country for  months See how the president called it  Non war and insisted he didn t need congressional permission because he was only bombing the shit out of Libya  they couldn t fight back  and the UK and France were doin it to  That in a nutshell is not only the most obvious answer to your question but it is also the most hypocritical act of any political party in the history of the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel global trade is a prime example of one of the positives of globalization By no means is it perfect but it has amazing benefits for an entire population  I also think its ridiculous to say that we wouldn t face large problems with out global interactions However as I pointed out our inability to be forward thinking and only focus on the now has caused great instability Not to mention our ability to solve these issues is awful 
PoliticalDiscussion,Canada understands that the first amendment needs modmins to tell us what is ok and what isn t 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I hate to be uninformed in what way did he give aid or comfort to the enemy  How do his actions aid and comfort the enemy Well it aids them by giving their viewpoints and arguments merit and it comforts them when they feel the need to strap on a suicide vest and blow up a market   gt but neither are they the  terrorists  enemy we are  Oh   you are just an idiot Good for you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The globality of our problems is more evident than before  due to globalization of course  I feel there is more instability as a result  While the magnitude of problems may be larger due to more systems being connected I would have to disagree with the premise that globalization has resulted in more instability  For example if a frost kills all of the orange orchards in Florida Brazil can increase its exports and help stabilize the orange market  one could make the argument that without global trade Florida would not have specialized in oranges so heavily but this ignores comparative advantages between even very close locales say between Florida and Texas   We can debate the pros and cons of global trade but it has most assuredly increased stability at least in the supply of goods and services    What people seem to fail to realize when making the claim that globalization leads to instability is that local imbalances will always play a large role in shaping local conditions but having a larger pool from which to draw resources  commodities labor services etc    gives people more options and the overall system is less prone to individual fluctuations  I think it s ridiculous to say that without global interactions people wouldn t face large problems be they food shortages or economic bubbles  see the Tulip Mania  
PoliticalDiscussion,rookie mistake  P
PoliticalDiscussion,wanted to keep it somewhat civil I guess I felt that implying that the people in their   s should fuck off and  pass on was in a way harsh   
PoliticalDiscussion,haha you don t come across as a dick but as I mentioned to the above poster I would be happy to discuss which of my claims are incorrect The perspective I use is one of high expectations We have the great advantage of global communication and instant access to information We also have great material comfort and advanced technology I would hope that with all these advantages things would be better than they are now   
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t know how voice analysis would prove inconclusive The voice on the surrounding  calls doesn t sound at all like the voice from Zimmerman s first call yelling or no That was definitely the boy As for the stand your ground law I would think that going against the advice of the operator would discount the reasonable argument He was looking for a confrontation and he made it Trayvon didn t have anything that would suggest he was being unlawful I cant imagine any judge supporting that because that establishes the premise of  I can chase down any pedestrian I want and murder them because they looked suspicious  
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know if you would know but my question would be would the  stand your ground law argument even work in this case  The reason being that from everything I have heard Zimmerman was in his car when he called  and the operators told him to remain there  By exiting his car does that not mean that he realistically throws out any chance at reasonable self defense  I could see maybe if the kid was waving a gun around that Zimmerman could argue he got out of his car to defend himself but they found no weapons on the boy    I know in a post below you point out that Zimmerman is the head of the neighborhood watch and just doing his duty by confronting the boy but I think his duty ends with the call to   His vigilantism begins with him getting out of the car to confront the boy    Being a part of a neighborhood watch does not give you police powers its merely a group that s thrown together by people to deter would be burglars and other non upstanding citizens  
PoliticalDiscussion,I was originally going to use the Corvette as the example but I wasn t sure if they were around in the  s  gt  lt 
PoliticalDiscussion, In  the Canadian Radio television and Telecommunications Commission  CRTC rejected a Canadian Cable Telecommunications Association  CCTA application to bring Fox News to Canada because Fox News U S and Global Television were planning to create Fox News Canada a combination of U S and Canadian news However in  after a Fox U S executive said there were no plans to create the combined channel the CRTC approved an application to bring Fox News to Canada      Fox News Channel is currently offered by Access Communications Bell TV Cogeco Eastlink Manitoba Telecom Services Rogers SaskTel Shaw Cable Shaw Direct and Telus TV A notable exception is Vid otron Canada s third largest cable company which has not added Fox News Channel to its lineup       
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the thoughtful response You actually answered your own question The globality of our problems is more evident than before  due to globalization of course   I feel there is more instability as a result  Just look at the Financial crisis of  and consider the global ripple effect of the abuse of a complex interconnected economy The corrupt immoral and greedy actions of a few people relatively speaking had a negative effect on millions of people And even  years later many developed countries are still recovering  We have shown very little ability to come together to solve the problems that face our countries let alone the problems that face us as an international community  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re misinterpreting what I said I didn t say  amend the constitution  I said  small changes to the proposed law   The Constitution doesn t need amending for that law to be passed Laws of the form I proposed already exist and are already enforced and do not seem to conflict with the Constitution   gt Plus is Fox News calling itself news really that determinative If they called themselves Fox Editorials they could satisfy your rule while changing nothing else  Yes I think it really is that important  And note that I m not saying a company named  Fox News would be unable to do editorial sections I m simply saying that they wouldn t be able to mark those segments as news 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m also curious to know whether the police or FBI know where to find Zimmerman if when they decide to arrest him  I ve heard he s in hiding now  
PoliticalDiscussion,and fox continues the meme that all our problems are from  godless liberals when our economey is in the tank from Bush s Butter and Guns  Which Obama is continuing    Let s watch fox try and walk back their The President is a Muslim BS gt        When they first featured the claim in  as if it were a serious news story the Obama campaign shot back by condemning their irresponsible journalism Even CNN host Wolf Blitzer criticized Fox News by proxy explaining that CNN had sent a reporter to Indonesia to investigate the so called story like  any serious news organization is supposed to do   
PoliticalDiscussion,bit of an exaggeration but your point is taken
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that freedom of the press is important but I think that programs that represent themselves as  news should not be able to outright lie Bias is one thing misrepresenting the truth or blatantly lying and later putting out a small correction that no one sees Television is just a form of propaganda after all be it for political reasons or marketing but there should be some kind of standard to which we hold our newsrooms with hefty penalties for failure It goes beyond just Fox too Putting up stories that have not been researched or fact checked can tank markets and hurt people Newsmen and women like our political leaders should be better than most of us but as our country becomes more and more Randian and profit driven it seems that  the best of us have morals and standards that are up for sale to the highest bidder  Again I don t think we should censor outright and I don t think everyone needs to live up to a high standard of unbiased reporting or fact checked sources but I think that someone claiming to be reporting truthful news stories who lies should have some kind of punishment be it monetary penalties or simply requiring they say that they are a biased party and not an impartial and factual news source  Or not Just ranting  P
PoliticalDiscussion,I am referring to Western society in general The up and  comers will need to pay for our parents mistakes
PoliticalDiscussion,hahaha I agree    But since our problems are more global than before i feel there is more instability as a result  Just look at the Financial crisis of  and consider the global ripple effect of the abuse of a complex interconnected economy
PoliticalDiscussion,Personally I d make a few small changes to the proposed law  You are not allowed to knowingly spread false information and call it  news   Calling it whatever else you want would be fine That satisfies my requirements for the First Amendment  if the government were to start doing Ministry of Truth stuff to  official news  then people would just start ignoring everything labeled  news  
PoliticalDiscussion, How are things worse than they were  years ago   We have shown very little ability to come together to solve the problems that face out countries let alone the problems that face us as an international community Don t get me wrong many things are better but I also feel some things are much more unstable
PoliticalDiscussion,Stick around for a while Some days I m serious some days I m just stirring the pot 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well they re doing voice analysis of the calls If it turns out to Zimmerman screaming then that s also a pretty important thing If they turn out to be Trayvon I agree he s screwed But if they come out to be inconclusive  they don t who it was then he may just have a case for reasonable doubt A lot is riding on what the FBI says about who s screaming on those tapes 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you are implying that I am entitled due to my age  That assumption would be incorrect as I paid my way through college and grad school with money I earned through working I do participate  vote volunteer and study in my political system 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree it s horrendous And terribly unfair The thing that gets me is that these laws actually exist in the first place that allow you to kill someone to prevent an assault If it did happen as you stated and that Trayvon  tried to fight him then this makes things even more twisted As these gated communities are basically all private property and from what I understand the shooting didn t occur on a main street but instead a private alleyway  where he as the Neighborhood Watch guy would have every right to be  As much as I hate it I have a feeling the guy might get off the Murder charges Perhaps Manslaughter The one thing that no one wants to think about is the chance that he may just get off all together 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are any of my claims incorrect If you would like I can use more specifics But to sum up the current issues the world is facing without using generalities would turn in to a  word thesis  If you feel any of my claims are correct I would be happy to point out specifics 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Anyone who has ever worked at a startup for a share of equity instead of cash salary took a job from a  poor guy with the expectation of both of them not being poor in the near future  When I refer to  poor people I am talking about the legions of indolent dumb masses who vote for a living and continually decry the productive as  not paying their fair share  As we can see  here   the bottom  paid   of all income taxes collected while the top  paid   please explain how this is even remotely  fair  
PoliticalDiscussion,We don t allow people to claim that they are police officers We don t allow libel or fraud We do not allow copyright infringement  The First Amendment is not and never has been a blanket justification for all speech in all forms 
PoliticalDiscussion,what are you looking at being in conclusive about the recordings That Treyvon was the one screaming 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does the kid ever get to prove that he was being threatened    I can t turn off the parent in me  Can t stop imagining my own kid or kids that I know in that position  Walking home from the   chatting on phone w girlfriend some guy starts following him tries to run away when that doesn t work tries to fight the guy off   ends up dead    Sure it s possible that it didn t happen like that  But every new piece of information just supports that storyline even more  I can t even imagine how Zimmerman can prove his story is true  And I can t shake the feeling that it s not fair for him to just be able to say whatever he wants   we have to believe it because the only other witness is the dead victim    Hoping the FBI voice analysis shows that it was Trayvon screaming   that he stopped right after the gunshot  Oh those screams are so hard to hear when you ve got an almost teenaged son 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very well said You missed The  Non War in libya that never received congressional approval and was waged for  months    long after the  days of the War Powers Act expired  No permission for war is the only actual impeachable offense IMO 
PoliticalDiscussion,If there is no objective quantifiable analysis involved then they should just ask FOX News at least they would have the balls to admit we re   
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh wow you post in r conservative so we know off the bat you re a fucking moron Simply associating with any conservative ideology is beyond moronic Their social policy is veritably nonsensical and the conservative fiscal policy has been disproven time and time again over the last sixty years And you have negative comment karma on boards filled with people that think Ron Paul is a legitimate person to run for president 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the stand your ground law in Florida makes it legal for a person to initiate conflict and then end it with deadly force then I d say that law is unjust I d argue duty to retreat laws provide a better framework under witch killing in self defense can be justified 
PoliticalDiscussion,Both of them are talking out of their asses 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re delusional and horrendously angry You are willing to hate Obama for anything Please fuck the fuck off You re not intellectually competent 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you are like Marx right on about those you criticize and ludicrously optimistic about those you laud 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope  In fact if there  were a revolution I d probably join the Marines just to help quell it  There s no justification for a revolution  unless it s a secession when leaders are democratically elected and there isn t rampant election fraud  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but it DID NOT violate the Constitution That s a fact  HAhahahahahhaha    Oh man What a great ending 
PoliticalDiscussion,In r anarchism the big giant banner says something like  When the rich abuse the poor it s called capitalism When the poor fight back it s called violence  I ve never taken that subreddit seriously but I think it s unbelievably lulzy that a bunch of college undergrads with computers classify themselves as poor 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We circumvented the Constitution  VOTE OBAMA    WE CIRCUMVENTED THE CONSTITUTION    It has a nice ring You should run with it Better than   W  in   T  he   F  uture   
PoliticalDiscussion,No learn to fucking read and comprehend what an ANALOGY is We circumvented the Constitution You can be mad that sneaky and underhanded methods were used to disregard the intent of the law but it DID NOT violate the Constitution That s a fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you really think the US Army which is now full of soulless immigrants would offer the slightest hesitation in putting a Javelin missile into your home You give Western millennials too much credit OP feminized and castrated charging into a tank column with their skinny jeans and ironic glasses shining brightly in the dawn sun  It wouldn t last a week 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It does not matter if the arrangement in Libya violated the Constitution  Spoken like a true obamaton   gt As someone who studies and is currently in practice with the law  How is that ambulance chase going Did you catch one yet   gt Think of it this way Jaywalking  Yeah   Jaywalking is  just like bombing the shit out of Libya without congressional permission You should inform all of your clients of your wisdom before they pay you a penny   just so they know how smart you are 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s actually blatantly clear how much  you don t know Just because something violates our Constitutions principles and guidelines does not mean it was a breach of our Constitution Our Constitution applies to us Not to other countries alliances etc It does not matter if the arrangement in Libya violated the Constitution because it was done through NATO If it violates a part of a treaty or agreement with NATO then the issue you want to bring up is us ignoring NATO rules  and them going along with it    This is a simple matter of the law As someone who studies and is currently in practice with the law that s what s at stake here Think of it this way Jaywalking is illegal if you re walking through a street at a non crosswalk area If you somehow instantaneously erect a bridge to get over the middle of the street in an area without a crosswalk it s no longer jaywalking That s what happened here We circumvented our Constitution  Even a Bush legal adviser who s a professor at Harvard Law backs this up 
PoliticalDiscussion,well since you were engaged in an unlawful activity that law doesn t apply 
PoliticalDiscussion,umad umad 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Well   what the girlfriend thought it sounded like and what it was are two wholly different things  Sure but her word that Trayvon knew he was being followed and was trying to get away isn t inherently less trustworthy than Zimmerman s claim that Trayvon snuck up and attacked him from behind and is going to make  much more sense to the vast majority of the general public from a  what would I do in Trayvon s shoes if some creepy guy was tailing me after dark  perspective   gt The gun is still probably in Zimmerman s possession    Probably being the key word Do we know Do the police They ought to have taken it as evidence in the first place Also from what I ve heard Zimmerman s injuries were never officially examined so we don t know exactly what they were or how serious 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok I looked and crisis of the mode of production is a typical time for revolution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives have lost the battle on virtually every major social issue and will continue to lose I m not sure what you re blathering about 
PoliticalDiscussion,And what are the ground forces of this  Bloody Revolution going to made of  Liberal arts majors who ve never held a gun rich kids whose parents bought them paintball guns with  tactical vest   and internet tough guys who ve played Call of Duty  Good luck buddy 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is true but compared to other times in history it was still quite peaceful  The risk of death from war was comparatively low  The major difference was our knowing these numbers  earlier wars lacked such statistics and the fact that they were while bloody relatively uncommon  While there was certainly anguish from the Cold War overall we did pretty well in terms of life expectancy and economic development  Sub Saharan Africa being the only real exception   We should be pretty happy to live when we do 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Can you say beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman caused this to escalate from a confrontation into a fight Of course not  You should wait for me to answer your questions before you go and base your arguments off an assumed answer   George Zimmerman is on tape calling the kid an asshole He is on tape giving chase to the kid Those are the start to the confrontation in my book and thus George Zimmerman started the the fight and then killed the guy he started teh fight with when it wasn t going his way   If i chase a guy down in a parking lot yelling at him and then he throws a punch at me when i finally get close enough to tackle or hit him the fact that he threw the first punch does not mean I am acting in defense    gt The man who throws the first punch is the aggressor in the eyes of the law  The  recording indicated that George was the one who threw the first punch Here is how He chased the kid he called him an asshole and he clearly thought the kid was a criminal in need of apprehension Clearly he had every intention of apprehending the kid and that act the act of apprehension is the  first punch that lands him squarely on the side of the aggressor and thus unable to use the self defense argument   You seem to be making the assumption that this man chased the kid down at which point the kid stopped and they both had a conversation and then the kid punched him I can t see that happening He chased the kid  aggressive act and the kid reacted in self defense And was killed for defending himself   
PoliticalDiscussion,I wholeheartedly agree that the courts are there for a reason  In my opinion if this did go to court he would probably be charged for committing a crime of passion  He definitely does not deserve life in prison or execution as some have called for  
PoliticalDiscussion,The girlfriend says it sounded like Trayvon was pushed right before the call went dead so if she s correct about that then Zimmerman likely did make the first move and Trayvon was justified in acting in self defense Whether it s provable at this point is another matter entirely of course 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Press Freedom Index while interesting has many flaws Most importantly the rankings are based off of questionnaires and surveys sent to RWB s chapters in every nation   so it s really difficult to draw comparisons between different nations in that regard There is no objective quantifiable analysis involved 
PoliticalDiscussion,President is still quite a lot less powerful than an emperor like windchime was suggesting  I wouldn t  gladly hand the presidency to most nominees for the job either    As the late Douglas Adams put it  anyone capable to getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well   what the girlfriend  thought it sounded like and what it was are two wholly different things  What we do know is that when police found Zimmerman he was scratched and cut up with wounds on his back as well     gt I really wish the police hadn t botched the initial investigation so badly because it would really help to know more details about the gun Zimmerman s physical condition etc which are probably now lost forever  Lost  How  The gun is still probably in Zimmerman s possession  The local PD has opened their books to the State and Fed with confidence  They have notes on Zimmerman s injuries and they may even have photos  wouldn t surprise me  
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure  Fights break out all the time and police are rarely able to prove the aggressor  There are also plenty of situations where a crime obviously occured but due to lack of evidence no one can be prosecuted  Just because both men would have valid self defense claims and one of them died doesn t mean that the other is automatically guilty 
PoliticalDiscussion,See that raises two huge issues   Due to it s private nature the owners have an incentive to provide the bare minimum to reduce costs This in effect results in a terrible standard of living well being and actual rehabilitation within the system These criminals are more likely to come out and be an even larger social burden on society when released and are much more likely to return  There is a direct correlation between a private prison being opened and the amount lobbied to create more criminal laws There are case studies that show soon as a private prison goes up a very significant amount of legislation starts going through that make once small crimes now have larger consequences   Unfortunately you re just going to have to take my word on this because I m not in the mood to find my sources and don t memorize them 
PoliticalDiscussion,The girlfriend said it sounded like Trayvon got pushed right before the call went dead which suggests Zimmerman started the fight and Trayvon was acting in self defense if he hit back but whether that can be proven at this point  who knows I really wish the police hadn t botched the initial investigation so badly because it would really help to know more details about the gun Zimmerman s physical condition etc which are probably now lost forever 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is opinionated and partisan  But I have to admit it isn t drivel  Iraq really isn t better off after the US invasion and Fox News did make up excuses  for Bush s failures as president 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are no eyewitnesses to the initial confrontation  Without proof that Zimmerman  picked a fight  it s awfully tough to disprove his self defense claims    Can you say beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman caused this to escalate from a confrontation into a fight  Of course not  Sure he disregarded the advice and followed this kid around but unless you can prove that he started the fight he can t really be convicted beyond a reasonable doubt   Innocent until proven guilty and all that   gt If I don t like some buy in my hood all I have to do is provoke an attack from him   People do this all the time in order to win civil suits  The man who throws the first punch is the aggressor in the eyes of the law  Sure there can be exigent circumstances in certain cases but since we don t have an eyewitness during the start of the confrontation this isn t one of them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t the kid have had a valid case for self defense against an armed and unknown man following him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Again as I commented earlier if the kid attacked an armed man who was following him wouldn t that constitute standing his ground against a threat Why is the armed white guy who initiated and followed the black kid the only person covered by the law Am I missing something obvious 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wait what If some guy followed you wearing a sidearm wouldn t the same law apply to the you Maybe the kid felt threatened and was standing his ground Why is no one commenting that an unknown man with a weapon following you wouldn t constitute a threat and that IF the kid attacked it was in self defense Why does the law only seem to apply to the white guy with the gun who may have initiated the whole thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure if it was Zimmerman s story or a witness account  With so many tabs open on the subject I may have melded the two  If there was a witness though then that would be the end of this stuff  Sorry 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not saying you are saying this but if your argument is drawn out farther one could assume that any man who walks around picking fights with others is free to kill them as long as they are not the one who threw the first punch   If I don t like some buy in my hood all I have to do is provoke an attack from him and now I am free to shoot and kill him   I don t like the sound of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing is none of those things really affects me  I m not LGBT I don t use drugs and I m a male  As much as I support those causes the fact that voting for that support may cost me a hobby that I thoroughly enjoy and a means to defend myself strikes me as appalling  I personally believe if Democrats were far more consistent in their battle for our civil liberties and rights they would easily be the more dominant political party  Not to mention the least hypocritical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but I haven t heard it from another witness  Do you have a link to that 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is much about the younger generation to be hopeful about My concern is that there is too much cynicism towards institutions and public service in general There will continue to be this disconnect between governments and people until people take ownership over their government and make sure it is made up of people who think like them and see the world the way they do My hope for the coming generation is that they don t fall into the trap of self disenfranchisement that has been a disease for progressive activism since the hippy s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yep  I just don t know what happened to being patient anymore  I feel like this whole shooting thing is being pushed by the powers that be to be bigger than it should be to  fan the flames and build the story up  The media is quite culpable here as it framed the story against Zimmerman from the start and cast doubt on it without knowing all the details  In the court of public opinion Zimmerman would have been executed by now which if anything should be a good reminder as to why we have a Justice System that we do  It may not be perfect it may not work all the time but I d rather take my chances in Court than to be dissected by News Analysts and talk show hosts 
PoliticalDiscussion,The initial escalation of force whereby Zimmerman directly disobeyed a directive from the police officer to stand down and not give chase warrants a breach from any application of stand your ground law Otherwise you could use this defense for any violent crime  For example Let s say I start to mug you You threaten me verbally so   I shoot you   Do I go to jail for murder No I   was  standing my ground    See Doesn t make sense now does it  Also him saying  fucking coons on the phone call also doesn t help as that is inflammatory language which suggests motive Who the fuck is under  and uses that kind of language What the fuck generation are we living in 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not clear who attacked who  Zimmerman certainly pursued Martin but who threw the first blow    According to an  eyewitness account   Zimmerman was getting his ass kicked and screaming for help at the time that he shot Martin    When police arrived on the scene Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head so he may have a valid claim of self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,There was a tangentially similar case in Houston several years ago when a man called Joe Horn shot two men robbing his neighbor s home in the back while they ran away    I think the clear problem with Stand Your Ground laws and Castle Doctrine is that they open up a lot of questions about whether or not a person has reasonable grounds to be afraid How do you define reasonable   is it reasonable if you thought you were in danger Is it reasonable if some other people would think that you were in danger Is it reasonable only if everyone would think you were in danger 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In this situation it goes directly to the people to judge instead of through the power hierarchy of government People are directly accountable to other people  And who enforces this accountability Other people With what authority do they enforce it    gt How do we solve this It s very easy do not grant anyone the authority to use aggressive force Grant everyone the right to retaliatory force This approach to society is essentially You leave me alone  my self property etc and I leave you alone You attack steal from me and I am entitled to repayment  And who is to say who attacked whom Who determines who was retaliating against whom How do you assure that these decisions are not corrupted by outside factors At some point someone has to be authorized to use force somewhere otherwise it all breaks down because no one would be able to enforce anything and a single person who just does not cooperate voluntarily causes everything to crumble 
PoliticalDiscussion,I totally agree with the hivemind mentality that you speak of and its good to have people such as yourself there to bring to light the other side  Unfortunately with the way this website works those who disagree are downvoted and hidden so it appears that only one side is told  That is why I personally have unsubscribed from the defaults and subscribe to these smaller subreddits where intellectual  usually discussion takes place  
PoliticalDiscussion,Very well  Though when  of Reddit has made up their minds without all the facts someone must challenge them and risk the negative karma  Otherwise it s just mob rule and un just to those involved  I m not saying Zimmerman may not be guilty but the evidence currently available suggests he may be  The claim may be suspect but without eye witnesses forensic evidence etc  We are only left with his side of the story  Anything else is pure speculation based on personal emotions   IMO the problem with most people isn t that they can think from an opposing viewpoint but that they refuse to consider it for fear they may be  wrong   I myself fall victim to that just like everyone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,If freedom of the press is your benchmark for where you would like to live then you should know that Canada is ranked  on the  Reporters Without Borders  Press Freedom Index   and the United States is ranked   
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of the evidence will likely not be based entirely on the event but the character and mindset of zimmerman They ll try and prove he was prejudice that he was ignoring  advice and that he acted recklessly There will probably be forensic analysis like how far zimmerman had to run how they were positioned etc to prove that Zimmerman attacked first and that Martin had a right to defend himself   Also if Zimmermans story changes even slightly he ll be in trouble   
PoliticalDiscussion,But that s not the law and not how self defense works Police dispatch can suggest that you don t go somewhere but as an American citizen you have the right to move freely within the country  in public areas  unless you ve done something to warrant arrest or detention  It s perfectly   legal  for Zimmerman to follow Martin as much as he wants He can t harass or threaten him but there are no restrictions on him moving where he wants to or asking Martin questions  You can t waive your right to self defense Making a stupid decision doesn t commit you to being pummeled At the point that Martin decided to attack Zimmerman had a right to defend himself with as Florida law states deadly force 
PoliticalDiscussion,Something looks awfully wrong here First off I don t think the flurry of accusations against Zimmerman are necessarily really fair or unbiased And it works the other way too with real problems with police coaching witnesses So I m really really withholding judgment  But here is the thing does this mean that anyone can walk up to any stranger and shoot them and say it was self defense provided they can be sure there are no witnesses At least in  stand your ground places 
PoliticalDiscussion,Plenty show me a clip of video pls
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it sort of does 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt would most people engage in a  revolution in this country  No and I d wager that the majority of people who would be willing to would likely do so for reasons quite opposite than what OWS is for 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t tell if  you are describing this post or Fox news 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clearly groovyboots doesn t agree with the for profit prison system either but I think that just posting how they are  supposed to work is highly misleading since it doesn t really work out that way   Being paid a flat rate per convict encourages private prisons to cram more and more people into the same space with less security less nutritious food etc   This also gives private prisons a profit motive to lobby government for excessively severe jail sentences for minor crimes  Many people feel that this is wrong but since they don t profit by reducing sentences they don t have the kind of lobbying dollars that the pri ons have  That said I think GB that you should go ahead and post your treatise  I could always use some new arguments with which to fight the good fight and you may also benefit from constructive criticism discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No any reasonable person is going to do all they can  Reasonable people are going to listen to police dispatch Once you find yourself on the ground getting beaten  in this context  you are past the point of making good decisions You confronted someone you found suspicious and had dispatch tell you not to follow You ve already made the bad decision because of which killing someone can t be justified as self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion, Hope is not lost  Read this book     It s free only  or so pages it s banned in many authoritarian dictatorships and it is excellent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dems do not have tv on lock down  Soccer Moms are what the rest of the channels cater too not Marxist Liberals  FOX has all the crazy people always talking about who we HAVE to bomb next and what programs we need to cut to pay for more Tax cuts to the rich Broken record already     Network TV is a joke along with MSNBC CNN is the most middle of the road but also lame I will say they did better job with presidential debates than Fox  Fox is the national fucking enquirer and most of the debt is from Butter and guns   gt REPUBLICAN tax cuts and wars not social programs We had a projected balanced budget before Bush took office who then gave it all away and spent us into the shit house Oh look a black guy let s blame him Debt stood at  TRILLION on the black guys inauguration day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah yes Douglas Adams   
PoliticalDiscussion,This isn t political discussion This is partisan horse shit opinionated drivel 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush passed TARP and GM bailout  Obama only extended but you would never know that watching Fox All a fucking shame CNN MSNBC suck too but they are nothing like Fox  I watch ALL news from all sides Fox viewers are notorious for ONLY watching fox as they are brain washed to not trust anything else   Shep Smith is hands down the best newscaster on ANY channel But he gets death threats from his audience on Fox  
PoliticalDiscussion,At the point that someone is on top of you beating you it s literally you or them It doesn t matter what has happened up to that point you are justified in defending yourself in any way you can Do you think  anyone would think  oh well I guess I had this coming time to roll over and die  No any reasonable person is going to do all they can  I would say that up until the point that Martin decided to get on top of Zimmerman and beat him you d be right there is no justification in shooting But once he does it s entirely justifiable 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you read history and compare the state of affairs when revolutions have happened and the state of affairs in america right now Revolution is not happening 
PoliticalDiscussion,well  this    TjoXfXUTw seems to punch a few holes in any potential self defense argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for now we will agree to disagree  I don t know I appreciate the open discussion but I see from your comment history  creeper I know that you have been arguing this side in multiple threads maybe that is just the nature of your account  hence your name but I think we will just be playing argument tennis if we continue on  But again thanks for the civility of your arguments even though we are discussing a not so civil situation  
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox news was plenty critical of W Bush but so was every other news station  even more so  CNN MSNBC ABC NBC etc starting getting stale and that was the first time I tried watching FOX It was rather refreshing to hear a different side Only when you try to make yourself understand the opposite of what you believe can you actually find logic 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So I m supposed to just sit there and take my beating because I said  hey kid what are you doing here   If you find the kid suspicious and police dispatch tells you they don t want you to follow him and you still confront him You ve put yourself into an impossible situation from which I don t see how you can reasonably justify ending a life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Martin was smaller than him younger and weaker let alone he didn t have any weopon of any kind   besides skittles of course
PoliticalDiscussion,Well let s just give up the idea of non republican governance forever   republican as in elected representatives instead of direct democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,That doesn t mean revolution can t be in order 
PoliticalDiscussion,So I m supposed to just sit there and take my beating because I said  hey kid what are you doing here   According to Zimmerman he got out of his car to check what street he was on and was on his way back to his car when the altercation began The witnesses statements corroborated this 
PoliticalDiscussion,On which part Why do you keep proving what I say right  p
PoliticalDiscussion,To be fair though Fox news is the ONLY TV news station that reports negative news about Democrats The Republican party can rot in hell for all I care but you have to admit the Dems have television on lock down I m glad I can see both sides and am not really sure why people want to censor one or the other so badly 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If someone is on top of me and beating me how am I not justified in shooting him  If you find yourself getting beaten as a result of a confrontation you initiated I don t see how you can be justified in shooting him 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Agreed but I do think that if someone truly does feel threatened that a normal person would not exit a vehicle to confront the person that they feel threatened by The person in the vehicle already has an advantage as they can just drive away I could understand exiting the vehicle if Trayvon had come to the other side and was trying to get in but from initial reports he exited on his own volition against the operator s orders  But this alone is simply not enough information  He exited the vehicle for his reasons   maybe to get a better look  Maybe he rounded the corner and Trayvon ducked behind a car or hid  According to Zimmerman he was attacked from behind it happened when he went to see where Trayvon went  Perhaps Trayvon waited in ambush for Zimmerman   gt I do believe that in this situation that Trayvon was an innocent victim  innocent in the fact that he should not have been accosted  based on what is probably a biased story from Zimmerman  biased in Zimmerman s favor and from what I have read in the various articles It is incredibly hard for me not to If I am not mistaken  and correct me if I am all they found on Trayvon was some candy and a cell phone And again was he not walking down a public road  again correct me if I am wrong  To me and again this is my opinion based off of limited information this does not seem like a situation where shooting someone twice is warranted I think you also have to take into account the situation Trayvon was a boy Zimmerman a man Zimmerman outweighed Trayvon by  pounds That s a pretty large difference in terms of a fair fight If Trayvon were a developed man with And according to Trayvon s girlfriend Zimmerman had been following Trayvon for some time before the altercation took place Again its a biased witness account but it is part of the story to look at  He may be innocent of any criminal wrong doing but my theory is this  Trayvon feeling threatened hid and ambushed Zimmerman thinking he was a threat  He gained the upper hand on Zimmerman and Zimmerman shot him  In this instance both parties tragically misunderstand each others intentions  This story would fit the available facts and statements  But ultimately would mean that this was an avoidable tragedy who s fault lies with both Zimmerman and Martin  If true then Zimmerman would still go free   gt Zimmerman is a White Hispanic Heritage doesn t necessarily matter in the public eye If you look white you are going to receive certain privileges than if you look black or brown I don t know if you have ever seen it but there was a show called Black White that was an interesting social experiment that you should watch to get a glimpse of what the differences are in every day life  But he doesn t even  look white  I mean he may be fair skinned  due to the photo flash  but he has a very Latino looking face      
PoliticalDiscussion,Military solutions are hopeless have you seen the gear our military has  Plus they ve been fighting insurgents for a decade  Who would fight them in America  Fat rednecks and skinny anarchists  It s almost a sick joke to suggest it s possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Awwww    go ask mommy for a snack Your blood sugar is a little low and you are starting to wet yourself after that tantrum 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see plenty of people on other networks critical of Obama  I never seen any Dem candidates on the CNN MSNBC payroll yet all Republican candidates are on fox s at one point or another  When someone on Fox is critical of any GOP member or President let me know  Bush got everything he wanted including  tax cuts  WHERE ARE THE JOBS oh we need more tax cuts right   
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay boilerplate disclaimer I hate private prisons and everything behind them  That bias confirmed  the state pays a given amount of money to the company that owns the prison on a per convict basis This is actually cheaper and more efficient on an individual basis than if the state simply incarcerated its own due to cheaper labor and private sector cost cutting measures in construction and maintenance In theory the state can keep a watchful eye on the quality of these prisons and in essence vote with its dollar  By all means PM me if you want my long shpiel on why this is a terrible goddamn system 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re making the same mistake  of Redditors and the Media is presuming guilt The second you do this the rest of the analysis is flawed I m not saying he is definitely NOT guilty but that there is no evidence of it at this time  I guess you are right in my mind I have already presumed that Zimmerman is guilty due to the various articles and such that I have read     gt What smell test Just because something sounds fishy doesn t mean you can act on it You need more information which is still unavailable or may never come up  By smell test I just mean my own personal observations based on the evidence I have been given     gt But this isn t illegal You don t have to follow  if you think you re better off They re in an air conditioned call center miles away they will advise you to do whatever covers their asses Not yours Zimmerman supposedly exited the vehicle to determine which street Trayvon was walking down and was supposedly attacked from behind   Agreed but I do think that if someone truly does feel threatened that a normal person would not exit a vehicle to confront the person that they feel threatened by  The person in the vehicle already has an advantage as they can just drive away  I could understand exiting the vehicle if Trayvon had come to the other side and was trying to get in but from initial reports he exited on his own volition against the operator s orders     gt    and STOP A lot could have happened between  exiting the vehicle and  guns an unarmed kid down  Not to mention that the fact that Trayvon being armed or not makes no difference People can kill with their fists just as well as a gun Also By phrasing it this way you are entertaining the fallacy that Trayvon was the victim which is not an impartial POV The trick here is to remain impartial and try and view things from every angle This is what Detectives Forensics folks Lawyers etc do Be like them and not like the angry masses who made their judgement on impartial information  I do believe that in this situation that Trayvon was an innocent victim  innocent in the fact that he should not have been accosted  based on what is probably a biased story from Zimmerman  biased in Zimmerman s favor and from what I have read in the various articles It is incredibly hard for me not to  If I am not mistaken  and correct me if I am all they found on Trayvon was some candy and a cell phone  And again was he not walking down a public road  again correct me if I am wrong   To me and again this is my opinion based off of limited information this does not seem like a situation where shooting someone twice is warranted  I think you also have to take into account the situation  Trayvon was a boy Zimmerman a man  Zimmerman outweighed Trayvon by  pounds  That s a pretty large difference in terms of a fair fight  If Trayvon were a developed man with   And according to Trayvon s  girlfriend    TjiRoqUk Zimmerman had been following Trayvon for some time before the altercation took place  Again its a biased witness account but it is part of the story to look at     gt Except Zimmerman is a Latino is he not Of Cuban descent Wouldn t this make him a minority as well  Zimmerman is a White Hispanic  Heritage doesn t necessarily matter in the public eye  If you look white you are going to receive certain privileges than if you look black or brown  I don t know if you have ever seen it but there was a show called Black White that was an interesting social experiment that you should watch to get a glimpse of what the differences are in every day life  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I am calling a spade a spade  Whatever Enjoy you hypocritical circlejerk 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have made it very clear in this thread how little you know 
PoliticalDiscussion,I really think most news accounts of this are highly biased against Zimmerman According to the wiki article there were multiple witnesses whose stories concurred with Zimmerman s version of events  Also Zimmerman had injuries to his face and the back of his head and grass stains on his jacket  as if someone were on top of him and striking his face  That changes the story a bit If someone is on top of me and beating me how am I not justified in shooting him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Republicans control the national debate and set the tone The liberal media is a bunch of little girls who only respond to Fox s positions   I am calling a spade a spade GWB would of never had half of his policies enacted into law without Fox including his reelection    There is NO  liberal channel that has that power 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry but that s not true It may have violated NATO agreements but not the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to the wiki article there were a few witnesses and they all backed up Zimmerman s story The physical evidence  wet grass stains on Zimmerman s jacket blood on his face and the back of his head also backs up his story  
PoliticalDiscussion, Just to be clear what you propose isn t  doing something to fix our broken system It is conceding admitting defeat   No admitting defeat would be voting for any of the candidates This election is screwed there is no real choice here The standard has just been set that low  Maybe over the course of the next  years we as a country can come together and say  This isn t right  but not now Not when so many people fell for the contraception  issue  and want a candidate who seems to want a theocracy   The reason we have such shitty choices is b c what is supposed to be the smart reasonable half of the country decides to vote Cthulhu out of apathy while the nonsensical half gets organized votes and gets their guy  of the douchebag or shit sandwich persuasion elected   Hi you must be new to politics the smart reasonable half of the country   is not represented Never will be Its always going to be troll candidates raising issues on sexuality and  morality riling up the bible belt or other hotspots with the issue of the week until we have womens rights under fire because everything leads to abortion  The only way a candidate would represent the smart reasonable half of the country is if the smart reasonable half of the country donated large sums of money Even then anything that would be donated could still be dwarfed by whatever rich millionaire or billionaire cocksucker sent because he s feeling like he s not being represented fairly  The system is broken and needs fixing and unfortunately it s gonna take a while for things to get fixed   You sir are part of the problem and what you suggest will only exacerbate it   No what makes it worse is when everyone accepts that they have to vote for Romney Gingrich Santorum and then after voting go on with their lives as if thats all they could have done  In the event that there is no win for the country in an election your stuck between a shit sandwich and a douchebag voting for an imaginary character out of irony rather than apathy says  fuck you  Voting for the shit sandwich or a douchebag says  I dont care that the standard has been set this low I m willing to accept these two choices as long as I still get to choose   This election is already lost the outcome will be the same Obama or  Bush  Neither is a choice any of us would really like to choose Just because one is slightly better than the other doesn t mean its a good choice  So what will you choose Irony or acceptance   
PoliticalDiscussion,Wrong
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is consistent with Zimmerman s story 
PoliticalDiscussion, I was right   
PoliticalDiscussion,It s cute how you say  IMHO  We need more self critical introspection down party lines and less finger pointing  And then begin finger pointing and drawing party lines What an awesome troll you are 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m from Canada
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the huge majority of them were aimed at the United States  Obviously they weren t actually aimed at one person s head  That portion of the comment was clearly hyperbole 
PoliticalDiscussion,I fail to see that part where they are pointed at your head 
PoliticalDiscussion,Use your brain for once in your life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those things don t happen The only actual video proof I ve ever seen of anything was that a five year old girl got pat down on her arms and legs and started crying That s not a big deal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt it passed because Obama endorsed it   As If it rested with Obama  he only extended it along wtih GM bailout  ALL STARTED WITH BUSH  Even Frannie and Freddie were Bush  Dream Act  BILLION    
PoliticalDiscussion,well put
PoliticalDiscussion,such as 
PoliticalDiscussion,   how about people running last term  you are grasping at straws
PoliticalDiscussion,IANAL but as I understand it he should have been arrested as a murder suspect  The there would be an arraignment after which if the evidence were fairly clear cut the prosecutor would decline to bring the case before a Grand Jury  As for the special treatment Zimmerman seems to be getting I can only hypothesize that the Thin Blue Line has extended to citizen patrols in that area 
PoliticalDiscussion,As I explained elsewhere Self Defense is a plea entered in response to charges  Charges are kind of moot when discussing a deceased person though it may have bearing in Zimmerman s trial charges 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Every article that mentions police saying that he was attacked when he got out of his truck says that the reason he got out of his truck was to look at the street signs So that s Zimmerman s story according to the newspapers that say they are quoting the police That part doesn t seem to be speculation  The fact he got out of the vehicle isn t speculation it s the ulterior motives posted by most redditors   that he got out of his vehicle to deal some justice to young Trayvon  That last bit is quite a lot of speculation   gt Looking forward to hearing what the FBI   grand jury have to say  As am I  But I feel that the FBI have a hard time making much of this  The one thing I ve asked before that no one was willing to answer is    What possible gain could there be for the Sanford PD the local DA s office and the State AG s office to cover this up    In all honesty George Zimmerman isn t some remarkable person  Doesn t appear to have familial or wealthy connections to the local politicians or police  He s just some hispanic dude with a white sounding last name who just shot a kid who was unarmed  So what s the motive  I know the tin foil hat brigade wants to say it s all due to some racist scheme but there are way too many people and agencies involved for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s funny looking at the paradigms that people operate under  To you if rich guys are permitted to keep that money it will be spent on wasteful useless spending like a th vacation to Hawaii  But here in the real world rich people do lots of wonderful things like  caring for the sick   with their money  To you if government collects more in tax revenue that money is directly spent on help for caring for the sick  But in the real world government participates in a lot of  wasteful useless spending    Tk xVQSY   Your view appears to be based on caricatured stereotyped and romanticized views of  the rich and of government  Oh and I guess you weren t around in  when Obama promised not only  to provide jobs to the jobless  as Romney has done but also to  tame the oceans and heal the planet    Of course it s a somewhat silly claim but to take Romney literally while giving Obama a pass is well shallow and hypocritical 
PoliticalDiscussion,   and when the FBI does nothing  Or if the Grand Jury does not find it to be a case worth taking to trial  Will you then accept you were wrong and that Zimmerman was righteous   I d also like to ask   What possible gain could there be for the Sanford PD the local DA s office and the State AG s office to cover this up   In all honesty George Zimmerman isn t some remarkable person Doesn t appear to have familial or wealthy connections to the local politicians or police He s just some hispanic dude with a white sounding last name who just shot a kid who was unarmed So what s the motive I know the tin foil hat brigade wants to say it s all due to some racist scheme but there are way too many people and agencies involved for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,So Obama says he will make it easier to be poor I can t afford it being any easier  So Romney is lying and Obama is telling the truth for a change Now we get our change and it sucks lol
PoliticalDiscussion,Allow me to congratulate you on tackling a fiercely partisan subject without too much bias or editorializing You had a wonderful post with great ideas behind it and are an example for this subreddit  That being said the replies so far are shit and I ll try to give better  I tend to agree much MUCH more with Romney and I d rather bring everyone up  even is some less than others than bring the top down to everyone else However this is irrelevant to the topic as I think you meant to capture how the two  Romney and Obama brought these two ideals to bear  Obama does prefer to spread the wealth around rather than make more wealth He s said so himself and it s pretty much understood to be his viewpoint It s a very distributive  I won t quite say socialist approach to equality and is sort of the stamp of the modern democratic party  Romney wants to allow capitalism to work He s most interested in letting free markets run their course and he has the experience to make me believe that s his true intention Almost universally conservatives know free markets are best for growth and so Romney wants growth through wanting a free market 
PoliticalDiscussion,La cosa es que muchos personas no entienden cuando estan siendo idiotos y se agregan a esto por seyendo aun mas estupido   No se encorigan 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  gt Would you feel better if  the white man said  Fuck em let them sort their own mess out  gt Right I guess they did a great job with slavery and colonialism All they need now is white Jesus to come save them  I guess your ability to pick up context clues is quite poor I m sure many Africans wish white people   never  came Many of the problems they are experiencing now are due to the class systems and institutions set up before or as the colonists were leaving So the attitude of I help you with this or fuck you and sort it out yourselves doesn t really carry much weight since they already are 
PoliticalDiscussion,OP s post is such garbage the content almost doesn t matter HOWEVER I d love to debate the actual issue with anyone  D  I can t find a single network besides Fox that doesn t do all this and worse for Obama CNN MSNBC ABC almost all comedy shows they all are so liberal it hurts yet nobody ever says anything  I think the fact that Fox is demonized is a startling singling out of a network given the sheer amount of left material that comes from every single other network on tv 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is a direct correlation between a private prison being opened and the amount lobbied to create more criminal laws  State run prison guard unions do EXACTLY the same thing  In California the Union is the most  vigorous defender of the  strikes law in the state is consistently against medical marijuana drug legalization prostitution legalization rehabilitation programs you name it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like you and him Let s jerk in a circle 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was never against raising awareness That is such a vague goal What I was against were MANY specific things Your  argument has been a ridiculous waste of time and a lot of  I never said that  You have written a lot without saying much 
PoliticalDiscussion,From what Did Zimmerman assault Martin That is not clear but the current testimony suggests otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,At what point does Martin have the right to defend himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do think though that without a little bit of stirred up emotions no one would have talked about this story  and other stories that need to be brought to light and then the police would not have pushed this up to the state s attorney   the FBI would not have gotten involved  Sometimes people do need to speak up when they see something happen that they think is wrong not just wait patiently for nothing to happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Every article that mentions police saying that he was attacked when he got out of his truck says that the reason he got out of his truck was to look at the street signs  So that s Zimmerman s story according to the newspapers that say they are quoting the police  That part doesn t seem to be speculation   Looking forward to hearing what the FBI   grand jury have to say 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think your attitude is shortsighted  Societies with more redistribution of income have higher standards of living  America had it s greatest growth in Prosperity when it had it s most redistributive policies in place  I doubt that it s news to you that economic progress is not a zero sum game   
PoliticalDiscussion,If self defense is only applied as a plea entered against charges brought then how could Zimmerman use stand your ground self defense as a way to avoid charges being brought 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you have RES tag the OP he posts really really stupid shit here all the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then why does the law only seem to apply to the guy with the gun who may have initiated the whole thing  Even taking race out of it the law just seems absurd when played out in a situation like this  Or any murder only witnessed by the now dead victim   murderer  
PoliticalDiscussion,What country are you from  You might have a similar system where you live  In  I saw  two documentaries  at the Toronto film festival about South American countries having privately owned run mental institutions and how they have a system of kick backs to the judges etc  Their doctors  again this was true diagnosed anyone put in front of them for  treatment and there it was entirely up to the doctor for you to be released 
PoliticalDiscussion,lol 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you think you can enforce your will over the rights of minorities be prepared for a fight on your hand  Keep in mind we re not talking about former exploiting classes but of minority sections of the people  You think just because capitalism is eliminated that all the old prejudices will vanish as well  That s precisely why certain rights need to be guaranteed even against majority will 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very true Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,D oh 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s irrelevant if Romney wants to work with a partisan legislature  The question is if a partisan legislature wants to work with him  Obama s enjoyed a House uninterested in doing anything useful 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no way there will be a successful violent revolution I ve have had my run ins with the violent revolution crowd and they seem to be calling for violence just because Instead of saying  hey let s get someone we like elected into office  they say  uh we need to go to war against the government I don t want to but I d be happy if someone went and got themselves killed for you know uh  change   The election process still works and if these violent revolution guys wanted to and were serious they could help elect people into office that were decent without one drop of blood spilled Instead they call for unnecessary violence that they will obvious not participate in personally 
PoliticalDiscussion,By all means go ahead 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do disagree No where does Mitt Romney indicate that he plans on making everyone rich You re the one making the claim that he is so you have to offer explanation not me 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s almost artful in its own little way  It is unfortunate though that I leave reddit alone for a week and suddenly OoR is getting big upvotes here 
PoliticalDiscussion,And I have been searching but can t find a video clip right now but there are plenty of clips where Mitt says asinine shit like  I want every American to be in the top   and that he is going to lead us there  Here s an interesting article I found as well though I doubt you ll read it    Basically he says whatever people want to hear to me it sounds like I work in sales and most people do or have at some point but when Romney speaks it s such a sales pitch he says exactly what you want to hear even though it sounds too good to be true and is highly unrealistic and he is in no position to offer the things he offers Like for example he says in the article above he will guarantee everyone has a job when they get out of college How can he guarantee that honestly Is he personally going to hire you  And also promising a job doesn t promise much you may be able to find a job once you get out of college at McDonald s  On the other hand I don t really feel like Obama is promising me unrealistic shit He is pro education and funding government assistance for education meaning it will be easier for people to go to school and be qualified in order to get those better jobs but that is different from his personally promising a job will be available after college He is basically saying well I won t PROMISE you a job but I ll give you the best tools possible to find one That seems more realistic and speaks to me more than Romney s sales pitch  Edit    Not the best source for the quote but this article lists it and the video although edited also has Mitt Romney saying he wants everyone to be   I know it s an edited clip so I don t know what he says before or after it but regardless of the context he is still making grandiose claims to appeal to people s selfishness and greed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Por que no los dos 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where do either of them say that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am arguing for redistributing your own income as much as you like not somebody else s by force  In my experience having this discussion I have only heard one other person argue in favor of wealth distribution from a self interest perspective Everyone else makes the moral argument against self interest without realizing that an argument against self interest is an argument in favor of altruism which none of them practice themselves  People riot for stupid reasons You gain no moral authority through destruction If you destroy an innocent person s property then you deserve to be shot And if it was my property I would happily pull the trigger myself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Romney vows to repeal Obamacare but other than that I can t think of many radical differences I think Romney would be willing to work with a partisan legislator more effectively than Obama has if his record as governor has anything to show for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,In my opinion the people more likely to get out their guns and fight are either hyper libertarians or christian fundamentalists They re the people that see government healthcare or separation of church and state  etc as true evils and are more quick to dehumanize the other side This is a major generalization of course but I stand by it  in general  Regardless nobody is going to be starting any revolutions anytime soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,they re compiled in  this   article if you do want to listen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Less hard to be poor because more jobs for middle class more tax cuts for middle class higher taxes on the rich pro tip Higher taxes on the rich will lower the national debt so there will be more room to pay for other things like healthcare for the sick and the poor etc   I m okay with raising taxes if it means benefitting the least fortunate and middle class So yeah that rich guy might not be able to take that th vacation to Hawaii  his th visit but a few hundred sick poor will be able to eat or get their meds or go to doctor There s nothing wrong with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I think too I d rather have a guy tell me something modestly disappointing such as  I won t make you rich but I will promote middle class tax cuts and jobs that pay okay so you re not poor and if you are poor at least you ll be able to see a doctor and eat  than some asshole lie to me and tell me that  YES you too can be in the    JUST VOTE FOR ME   
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t listened to anything  I kind of avoid any audio visual news in favor of transcripts or articles  but I did read an article that mentioned Treyvon s father initially saying that the screaming wasn t his son but then later saying it was  after some audio clean up iirc   But I really don t know that there d be any appreciable difference between a teenager and an adult  Once the voice has cracked I think they d have pretty much the same possible range 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I never seen any Dem candidates on the CNN MSNBC payroll  Chris Mathews ran for the House in  as a Democrat  and lost  worked for Carter  D  worked for Tip O Neill  D  Al Sharpton former D presidential candidate  Larry O Donnell worked for Senator Moynihan  D  
PoliticalDiscussion, France collapsed so swiftly because its people had no heart for the war  as every observer had remarked even through the censorship from the beginning of the war And they had no heart for the war because the bourgeois ideologies by which they were appealed to no longer had power to move their hearts Men are prepared to be heroes for very foolish and unworthy ideals but they must at least believe in those ideals   James Burnham
PoliticalDiscussion,The thing is  self defense is a plea entered against charges  Assume for the sake of illustration it was all some big misunderstanding  Zimmerman was just going to ask Treyvon a few questions but Treyvon felt threatened and took a swing  If that was as far as it escalated then when Treyvon was charged with Assault he d plea  Not Guilty by reason of Justified Self Defense via the Standing Ground rule or something like that  But if Zimmerman were not intending aggression at that point Treyvon attacking him would trigger his own right to Stand his Ground  So it s not so much that the law only protects one of them as that self defense is only something that even comes up in response to charges being filed  While knowing would still impact Zimmerman s charges trial it s obviously rather hard to establish a mental state in a deceased person 
PoliticalDiscussion,I listened to a couple that were attached to an nytimes com article In one of them you could hear terrified screaming before a shot My mind may have been interpreting things given that I know the outcome but it sounded more like the scream of a teenager than the scream of an adult 
PoliticalDiscussion,You realize that  years ago the world was on the verge of a nuclear war between the half of the world that was communist and the half of the world that was capitalist That is was accepted as an unfortunate reality that we had to fight wars in all corners of the world to fight the spread of communism  years ago the only way we came together to solve problems was by joining together with other capitalist countries was to warn them to agree with us lest we perform a CIA backed coup to replace their leader with a totalitarian dictator   Things are drastically more stable in almost every part of the world 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt white  I thought he was Hispanic  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh the irony   We need more critical introspection and less finger pointing    which is why I am pointing the finger at Fox  NEWS for not attacking Republicans enough 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I feel that we do not possess that same destructive qualities of the baby boomers  No just different destructive qualities 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do they  The one detailed article about them just indicated that things were very inconclusive and that numerous people s stories were changing as time went on 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m feeling a touch cheeky here but making it less hard to be poor is far more plausible then making everyone rich particularly in a capitalist system 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Mitt Romney seems to be telling Americans he will make us all rich if we vote for him  Umm what  Please explain how you reached the conclusion that Romney is promising Americans that he will make them rich   gt Obama seems to be telling Americans he won t make us rich but he will make it less hard to be poor  By sending all of us into crippling debt 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush was president when TARP passed but it passed because Obama endorsed it  Do you remember   Bush was so defunct he might as well have been hiding in a closet 
PoliticalDiscussion,HA
PoliticalDiscussion, gt not because they weren t angry with our political system but because they felt that  occupying was just too darn peaceful for them   Do you make a habit of hanging out with revolutionary anarchists 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I think you are   Since you don t have any other real arguments 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d agree that there is a fine line between lawful conduct and assault I think that would be best decided by a court based on the circumstances of the particular case However it s not  necessarily assault It s possible to follow someone and ask them questions  even at night  in a lawful manner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox does mention the bad of the candidates on occasion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Following someone is not initiating conflict Asking questions is not initiating conflict  I disagree Doing this late at night to somebody you find suspicious is initiating conflict in my opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not at all Honestly I don t know how you could construe your situation to be  self defense at all  Perhaps I worded it poorly My point was that putting yourself in a dangerous position is not tantamount to giving up your right to defend yourself If you see someone breaking into a store and shout  hey thief stop  and the guy comes at you you can still defend yourself You don t lose your rights to life and limb because you  initiated conflict  That said it is a profoundly stupid thing to do  Likewise following a suspected thief burglar whatever and shouting  hey kid what are you doing here  is not a tacit invitation to get your face beaten 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes those things do not directly relate to your situation but if we all only looked out for our own interests rather than the interests that are in line with our Constitution then how different would our country be right now  The thing is why do I have to compromise my belief on one right for others  I only vote GOP because I m stuck between two choices and the lesser of two evils  An ideal candidate is a libertarian but fat chance ever seeing one of those go far   except the few that have   gt  But really if hypocrisy were your core issue and not just the issue of gun laws then wouldn t voting Republican be more appalling to you than voting Democrat   Yes  But then again it s difficult for me to trade one of my rights away for the possibility of someone else gaining theirs  My gun rights are just as stomped on as your right to smoke pot or to marry or to give your sister mom their freedom to choose what they want for their uterus  But it shouldn t be a trade off   Take a look at it from my shoes let s say a candidate were pro abortion pro gun pro legalization but wanted to ban all gay marriage  or restrict it reasonably  would you vote for them  Or the other guy who fervently supports your gay rights and nominally supports other ones  And let s say that s your choice every single election  You know voting for the other guy may advance others rights but detract the one which strikes home  But you know the other guy will protect yours  The problem isn t choosing it s the hypocrisy on both parties  You re fucked either way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope but what great theater I would happily donate to his campaign if he had a possibility of winning the GOP nod 
PoliticalDiscussion,The whole Fox vs MSNBC thing has been done to death  Yes they are both partisan arguing which has a greater denial of fact goes nowhere since we rarely can even agree on what is a fact these days  I find CNN just to be a joke in itself  Their drive for  hours news coverage has driven the quantity vs quality ratio into the ground They don t seem in the tank for either side just whatever promotes their need to keep reporting drivel badly  If you want to have a MSNBC vs Fox superbowl CNN is the gang of retarded officials that blow the coin toss  I m generally more annoyed at how many blatant lies regardless of the logo on the screen are pushed under the guise of news 
PoliticalDiscussion,So poorly trained recent highschool graduates can should be able to search your asshole your  year old daughters your  year old autistic childs and feel up your wife gf because you implicitly give them permission to do so if you dare wish to board a plane bus or boat As well as take naked pictures of all the above including children and that is ok in your mind because alternative means of travel exist And thus  searches are perfectly reasonable That  is a fair summation of what you are saying right You honestly don t see any problem or issues in any of the above   For a society that that is so hysteric about pedophiles and child abuse it is remarkable that TSA agents are allowed to violate all these  sacred norms as a matter of course just to preserve an illusion of security  I already pointed out based upon their own studies that they conclude that security is similar under the TSA as it was before  read relatively poor  despite the billions of additional investment 
PoliticalDiscussion,What does being pushed sound like exactly  In all honesty there isn t much detail to the call at all  She wasn t there and for all we know Martin acted first     gt Whether it s provable at this point is another matter entirely of course  It s not what you know it s what you can prove  That is ALL that matters  Everything else is just chatter and speculation  Everything here on Reddit is simply speculation based on impartial facts  If the District Attorney can make a case before the Grand Jury then we ll see this go to trial  But seeing as the local DA and the state AG passed on this   
PoliticalDiscussion,Crime of passion  That wouldn t fit the bill  Maybe manslaughter but the current story as the Courts see it  Zimmerman was attacked  At this point with the current evidence witness testimony and details it appears the State does not have legal grounds to charge him with anything  We ll see how the Grand Jury sees it  If they feel there is a case to bring to trial then it ll go to trial  If not then he ll go free 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting link  I wonder why we haven t heard anything more from the anonymous witness quoted in this story  The story is from  days ago 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sure but her word that Trayvon knew he was being followed and was trying to get away isn t inherently less trustworthy than Zimmerman s claim that Trayvon snuck up and attacked him from behind and is going to make much more sense to the vast majority of the general public from a  what would I do in Trayvon s shoes if some creepy guy was tailing me after dark  perspective     and if he waited in ambush or attacked Zimmerman without reason   gt  Probably being the key word Do we know Do the police They ought to have taken it as evidence in the first place Also from what I ve heard Zimmerman s injuries were never officially examined so we don t know exactly what they were or how serious  It s his gun  What do they need it for  What can Zimmerman possibly do to destroy evidence there 
PoliticalDiscussion,But how would anyone know sounds to me like the perfect crime as long as you can kill all the witnesses and feign a threatened demeanor 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t have a bloody revolution without plenty of meatbags to burst As long as the middle class is the most numerous and complacent there won t be enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the fact Zimmerman admits to following Trayvon coupled with the  asshole comment is enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was the aggressor If a sound tech can definitively prove it wasn t Zimmerman screaming for help it ll be pretty open and shut  One thing that does have me curious if Trayvon did try to confront Zimmerman  as Zimmerman claims  wouldn t Trayvon be within his legal rights to do so under the  Stand Your Ground law since he was being stalked by a grown man with a weapon Wouldn t this preempt Zimmerman s claim of self defense  
PoliticalDiscussion,Not to the  it doesn t They don t give a shit about the poor And like it or not unless there s a people s revolution the  will continue to run this country And the middle class and the poor will continue to have to beg for scraps from the  job creators  
PoliticalDiscussion,Following someone is not initiating conflict Asking questions is not initiating conflict If Zimmerman physically attacked Martin that s a completely different matter I don t think that is what happened though because Zimmerman was armed Why would an armed individual try to fight someone unarmed It just doesn t make sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are three sources of revenue for private prisons as far as I know   The state pays the company to take the prisoners   The prisoners often work manufacturing jobs with wages comparable to that of developing countries   The prison charges the prisoners unusually high prices for goods and services like phone use vending machines cigarettes  There may be other sources I am not an expert  Beyond that it is just about cutting costs as much as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You can t waive your right to self defense Making a stupid decision doesn t commit you to being pummeled At the point that Martin decided to attack Zimmerman had a right to defend himself with as Florida law states deadly force  So as a hypothetical you re saying that I can come up to you on the street shove you against into a wall punch you a couple times and when you fight back I can shoot you dead and claim self defense     Edit  Let me answer that for you I found a comment I saw in r law earlier quoting the part of Florida law that will be tough for Zimmerman to overcome   gt  Use of force by aggressor  The justification described in the preceding sections of this chapter is   not available to a person who     gt   Is attempting to commit committing or escaping after the commission of a forcible felony or   gt     Initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself unless     gt  a Such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he or she has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant or    gt  b In good faith the person withdraws from physical contact with the assailant and indicates clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to withdraw and terminate the use of force but the assailant continues or resumes the use of force  Emphasis above is mine original comment  here     Doesn t sound like a or b will apply That could change of course Have you seen anything to indicate that Zimmerman will be able to claim defense by way of a or b   What was the size difference between the two like    some odd pounds with a gun versus   year old  lb kid 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are so cute when you are angry   but you could use a thesaurus Don t you have an ER to browse for customers 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dunno about that  While the negotiation and background of the purchase were suspect the purchase was still ratified by Congress  If you really wanna see things go downhill just look at Alexander Hamilton who created the concept of  implied powers to create the First Bank of the United States 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t be afraid you re  correct  FDR set the precedent that large government and high taxation was acceptable  Almost  years later we re beginning to feel the weight of such government as the US economy becomes more globalized and the States Federal gov t become increasingly indebted providing services that were once promised  pensions healthcare etc    It s unsustainable  If you want to read more I recommend the Essays by Walter Russell Mead called  Beyond the Blue  and how the big government programs that dominated the th century are unsuitable for the global national realities of the st century   
PoliticalDiscussion,Prisoners have all these things 
PoliticalDiscussion,Without freedom the other things don t matter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Two wrongs don t make a right  Especially if you re the one who pointed out Bush s flaws and proceeded to repeat them 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s treason because it s presumed you are battling a democratic republican system which represents the people  It s naturally assumed that this process if intact should be the desired route of revolt  In all honesty the Founding Father probably didn t expect us to get this far 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not getting shot at  too frequently  
PoliticalDiscussion,In all honesty it s because of the delegate process in the Republican primaries  While Paul may not have won many states he has racked up a decent number of delegates who support him giving him some clout in the primaries  I m not sure he can use this leverage to get Romney to agree to some of his less controversial ideas or if he simply wants the VP position  But I don t think Romney or anyone would accept Paul as a VP so they may search for someone else who isn t in the race 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is ultimately punishment vs rehabilitation  America is a very pro punishment nation which believes prisons are giant boxes of misery to stick everyone in to from the dude pinched with a certain amount of narcotic to the pedobear to the axe murderer  Reform is almost completely unheard of and the treatment of convicts following their term pretty much guarantees a revolving door society of crooks rapists and thieves  The private prison system simply benefits from this cycle as it s cheaper to lock a guy up than it is to try and reform them into functional members of society  But because of our nations religious roots and unwillingness to fund reform programs means we see a lot of repeat offenders   Commit crime  dealing drugs  Get arrested  Go to jail  Get out of jail  Can t get job  Deals drugs  Goes back to jail  repeat
PoliticalDiscussion,No though he has some on both sides of the political spectrum his supporters lean more Republican than Democratic It s unclear how great the effect would be but it would almost certainly hurt Romney worse than Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,I imagine that each individual participant s criteria is different just as with any other ideal  I suppose that ultimately all liberal progressives won t be happy until everyone is taken care of equally something that will never happen  In contrast Conservatives seem to either want infinite war or total world domination and specifically the GOP seems like they would like the world to be wiped of all ethnicity that is different than the White  Merican  It s a classic problem of piling on more bureaucracy in an attempt to try to please everyone despite everyone wanting wildly different things and ending up pleasing nobody  In addition people get butt hurt when things don t always go their way and take these feeling to the extreme  Under Bush s presidency we saw the latter from the Democrats and now that Obama s in office there s a War on Christianity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is that absolutely true though   I feel Paul would also take many independents from Obama or at least deny them to both Romney and BHO   
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama is going to let the Bush tax cuts expire Romney would push heavily for their extension  I d argue this is the biggest domestic policy difference between the two of them as that decision will affect billions upon trillions of potential revenue the government might take in in the coming decade or two 
PoliticalDiscussion,As others have said he could But he won t Running as an independent would mean an automatic win for Obama basically as Ron Paul would siphon votes from the Republican candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the Supreme Court ruled that picketing a dead soldiers funeral while holding up signs that read  God Loves IEDS is protected speech while voicing your opinion against an elected leader could result in a  year prison term and isn t free speech Got it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically yes But frankly running as a third party is futile unless maybe if you have an assload of money to throw around Even then really the only effect of a somewhat significant third party is to take votes away from some other party  He might get some attention which I feel like is what he wants right now more than anything but it s probably not worth it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul is legally allowed to run as an independent but he has already promised that he won t and he has shown no indication that he wants to 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no reason he couldn t run as an independent and many people have suggested the possibility  Paul himself has said there is absolutely no chance he will run as an independent however so it is a moot point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cooperation unity the general welfare of us all of we the people who have joined together  
PoliticalDiscussion,And now I do not wish to converse with you You d have to be a child to think anything is going the right direction in this country  This statement was the epitome of your maturity level during this conversation  CHANGE ROFL I SO FUNNEE HERP DEERP  So please try not to preach do as I say not as I do You come off sounding like Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron is currently running for Vice President at best    Gingrich is running as a  Kingmaker  kind of like  give me whatever high ranking position in government that I choose and I will give you all my delegates so you can get the nomination and I will not make your administration a living hell  
PoliticalDiscussion,Dude chill Sleep occurs for some people But yes Obama did make promises he did not keep   I m not quite sure how reliable Politifact is but here s a list of a few promises Obama failed along with some he kept      I m not saying that the GOP doesn t do the same but you cannot ignore one side s failings yet embrace the other s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not necessarily you those are just some complaints that I hear a lot from young people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your thesis is huge Whether or not things are overall better or worse now than  years ago   I mean some things are worse but a lot of things are better How do you quantify  overall improvement  We don t have a draft we don t have a cold war we don t have a world war the world is generally freer   
PoliticalDiscussion,Your tax system is pretty standard other wise it would be regressive which is proven to be a poor standard for an economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our Rights were always symbolic  They are given to  most of us during times of social peace  History show that when things got messy our rights were taken away  every single time  This time is no different    When things calm down we can have our symbolic rights given back to  most of us 
PoliticalDiscussion,chicken nuggets
PoliticalDiscussion,The police have reported that they found Zimmerman with cuts bruises and grass stains     gt By the time police arrived Martin was dead with a gunshot wound in the chest Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose and the back of the head and had wet grass stains on his red jacket He claimed self defense telling police he had stepped out of his truck to check the name of the street he was on when Trayvon attacked him from behind as he walked back to his truck He said he fired the semiautomatic handgun because he feared for his life    Police arrival  We also have the witness that says they saw Martin on top of Zimmerman beating him     gt  The guy on the bottom who had a red sweater on was yelling to me  Help Help  and I told him to stop and I was calling   said the witness who asked to be identified only by his first name John     ixzzpkkzSEbL 
PoliticalDiscussion,No 
PoliticalDiscussion,No not really He kind of panders to the Republican hawks with statements like Iran needs to be  dealt with  but he doesn t call for military action like Santorum or even Gingrich To say that Romney is more likely to take us to war than Obama is an unsupported claim 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Once again there is not even a  supposed attack from behind I have no idea where you are getting this from  Zimmerman s account  We don t know when the query happened and when the attack happened  Could be seconds apart or minutes apart 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There are phone records that support this version of the story  Not from what I heard  The only phone record we have is Trayvon thinking someone was following him and the line going dead   gt Why are you trying to spin this as a calamity of errors when it was cold blooded murder  Why are you trying to spin it into cold blooded murder when the evidence shows it self defense  When police found Zimmerman he had cuts and bruises and grass stains indicating he was attacked 
PoliticalDiscussion,Food  Clean water  Shelter  Clothing  Healthcare 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing comes to mind 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where have you observed this   I WISH there were more people who identified as center The   vast majority  of people I talk to identify as either left liberal or right conservative 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok NO ONE IS SAYING FOX NEWS IS GREAT JOURNALISM NOBODY WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF THEY PUT OUT THAT ISN T THE FUCKING POINT 
PoliticalDiscussion,So basically your philosophy is harm prevention oriented utilitarianism not human or civil rights deontology 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am Distributist with some Libertarian tendencies and thus G K Chesterton An Outline to Sanity   Hilaire Belloc The Servile State  I figure the opposite would be some kind of state socialism  state capitalism   that would make Marx 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I do not wish to converse with you as you re comment was childish and did not contribute to the debate in any way  Like when you say  Romney is a liar and Obama is telling the truth  
PoliticalDiscussion,How much did Obama s campaign pay you to write that  Sheesh 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it is more these tensions exist all the time but as long as person is reasonably succesful materially he tends to focus on that   I can tell you I really dislike a great many ideas and people but I love my SO more than I dislike them so as long as things are going OK I will focus on finding the perfect house for her and earning the money for it than on me being angry on other folks One this drifts out of reach this changes fast 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I realize this is probably a pointless question since it involves religious beliefs and rational thought isn t exactly a mainstay there  Religion can be pretty rational actually And the answer is that sex is good because it creates life Being asexual is bad because it doesn t However sex can be sacrificed for a higher spiritual good and only in this case only it is good to be celibate Same way as suicide is bad but dying for a worthy cause is good   And I am not even religious just reading everything    
PoliticalDiscussion,Yours conveys the image of an ironic hipster which is arguably worse so you should not challenge people on their nicknames   
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is a too much  actual politics  too much legislation oriented view There are very important philosophical differences Conservatives for example tend to think people should get stuff so that it provides good incentives rewards good behavior and punishes a bad one while liberals tend to think people should get things according to their needs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Traditionalist vs progressive  Classicist vs modernist
PoliticalDiscussion,It s populism not conservatism  genuine conservatism is always aristocratic and thus cannot really survive for long in a democratic demotic culture 
PoliticalDiscussion,The whole problem with the privatize VS nationalised prison is an unfortunate debate because prisons are a bad way of dealing with crime Yes it is absolutely USEFUL for removing individuals from society that should not be in society  but it creates criminals  In Scotland there are private prisons I remember watching a documentary on prisons which showed that while both systems were poor state led prisons are better In private prisons guards were awful to the inmates conditions were terrible security was lax etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,  You have friends all over  Reddit Activist Network   
PoliticalDiscussion,   IMO this is a tragedy due to mis cues on both involved  Zimmerman followed Trayvon on foot  Trayvon thought he lost Zimmerman and then Zimmerman caught up to him on foot and shot Trayvon dead  There are phone records that support this version of the story  You can hear Trayvon screaming for help right before he was shot dead  Why are you trying to spin this as a calamity of errors when it was cold blooded murder  
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly someone will always have to sweep the streets clean the toilets make that fucking sandwich at subway  If they could do that without worrying about going bankrupt from having to take a trip to the emergency room that will make their lives easier 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot that the Private Prison Industry also lobbies and gives large campaign donations to judges and lawmakers to make sure their cells stay full 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s sort of like somebody saying  Everybody is going to have a private jet versus someone else saying  Nobody will be unable to get a bus pass   Most people can already afford a bus pass in fact they have a car and feel that they don t need to take the bus ever so they don t think the second speaker will do anything that would benefit them at all  They aren t stupid they know it s not possible for everybody to have a private jet but they do give some credence to notion that a handful of people will be enabled to have a private jet that otherwise wouldn t have and that they  juuust might manage to be one of them if they support the first candidate  They see it as a small possibly fake argument but in their minds there s a chance that they might get something out of it  It s really alot like the psychology motivating people to play the lottery  The issue to me isn t so much ignorance on the part of the voters it s a message problem by the second candidate and his supporters  People don t need to be told that they aren t that likely to get super rich one day they can very easily accept that already  They don t need to be told that the candidate that supports the super rich won t help the poor at all they accept that too  The case that has to be made to them is how it would benefit them if everybody had a bus pass  You can t make it an appeal to charity or altruism  It has to be enlightened self interest  And you can do that pretty easily  Steal the language of the first candidate but instead of making poor people the enemy make poor ness the enemy  Take the image of the welfare recipient pulling money out of their pockets and flip it on it s head  If you can give that recipient a bus pass now they can get to their job  If you give them access to daycare they can get a job  If you give them medical care they won t get sick and lose that job  Change the debate so that the problem isn t social services and welfare it s the half assed nature of them  If you only give people enough to barely get by and not enough to get ahead and improve their situation then they will be totally reliant on taxpayers to stay afloat with no end in sight  The republican message works well because it taps into a sense of self interested self reliance that appeals to people  To subvert that message you have to tap into those same sensibilities and subtly tweak the message so that the way to fix the situation is by doing things properly for a change 
PoliticalDiscussion,Chief Bill Lee of the Sanford Police Department on Thursday evening said the account given by Martin s family and attorney is correct that Zimmerman saw the young man walking home from the store He said that Zimmerman did indeed call  and report a suspicious person and that he was told not to follow him   For some reason he felt that Trayvon the way that he was walking or appeared seemed suspicious to him  Lee said  He called this in and at one part of this initial call  the dispatcher recommends him not to follow Trayvon A police officer is on the way at that point   Lee said that Zimmerman instead followed Martin   I believe that Mr Zimmerman was trying to by his account find an address to give the officers and also trying to keep Trayvon in eyesight   Zimmerman told the police that Martin noticed that he was being followed and asked  what s your problem    Once again there is not even a  supposed attack from behind  I have no idea where you are getting this from 
PoliticalDiscussion,tl dr
PoliticalDiscussion,Oversimplifying With a text block that size  I just tldr ed it 
PoliticalDiscussion,We don t know any of that  You have no evidence much less proof that Zimmerman was  scratched and cut up with wounds on his back   For someone preaching that people should be speaking with certainty and waiting for the facts you are sure making up a lot of facts to support your hypothesis 
PoliticalDiscussion,I noticed that too but interestingly you can actually parse it in a way that makes sense   making it less hard to be poor   gt  making it lesser harder to be  to exist  when you re poor   Basically you ll still be poor but you ll have a better life because of the social safety net 
PoliticalDiscussion, If someone asks you  Hey do you live here  is it OK for you to jump on them and beat the crap out of somebody  Lee said  It s not   Read more here   storylink cpy  This does not jive with Zimmerman being attacked from behind  This is the police chief talking  I would think he has more knowledge of the evidence that the police do have than anyone commenting here  Zimmerman should have to take the stand under oath to make his case for self defense  
PoliticalDiscussion, Such as         On the other hand     
PoliticalDiscussion,Fear will keep the remaining states in line 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our fear that one day Iran might have nuclear weapons pales in comparison to the fact that the Soviet Union had even more nuclear weapons than us for most of the cold war and was at many times dangerously close to using them   Strain on health services exists because we set up a system of free health care for the elderly after a massive population burst and then the population stopped growing so fast so now a small young population has to support a massive old population This is a temporary problem because that boom is now dying and will soon be entirely dead That is a problem that is in the process of solving itself  Global warming climate change and oil security are in many respects related to the same core issues so I will address all three together Global warming and climate change are made significantly less serious by the inevitability of rising prices of oil from lack of supply Our current use will not be feasible when the supply of oil relative to the still growing demand continues to shrink even faster thanks to China   Population control is enabled by the massive increases in food production that have occurred in recent decades Because we can  sort of sustain more people there are more people The fact that increased food production just leads to greater numbers of starving people existing instead of leading to the elimination of starvation is a good argument against technological efforts to decrease food prices  since it just causes more people to exist thus making the problem even worse   As for poverty I don t see what you are getting at How is poverty in developed nations a significantly more serious issue than it was  years ago Wouldn t you say that in developed nations education food supply medical care and economic equality between races and genders is far better than it was  years ago  I realize that there are still very serious issues facing the world today My point is not that there are no issues but that the flaws of our society today are vastly preferable to the flaws of society as it existed  years ago Some things such as global warming are not even society problems at all but rather unfortunate effects of decisions made over a century ago This cannot be blamed on either period as it predated both our society and the society that existed  years ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,This law makes it illegal for any person who is present and acting in a sense that is less than  orderly in front of a restricted building or protected person a federal crime This means we now have legislature that makes it Illegal to protest the president or on the white house lawn There is a thin line between a protest and a Riot A protest must be loud it must impede government and it must be disruptive for it to work how it is supposed to This is being an active part of democracy and it should disturb the peace but this Act means they can  restrict where you can practice free speech and that is something to speak up about  Edit rephrased
PoliticalDiscussion, gt His argument is that free markets less regulation and minimal government interference in the lives of citizens generally results in people being able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps instead of receiving entitlements from the government  When Adam Smith wrote about free markets it worked like a caste system politicians were all noblemen the wealthy were individuals that lived and died by their own merits and the lower class or poor were never forced to work and could live off the land This  pull yourself up by your bootstraps nonsense is completely unsubstantiated rhetoric  To me it all seems to come down to what someone is willing to label as an  entitlements  Is a modern society not required to feed the starving Is that really an entitlement Do you not benefit from not having starving people littering the streets the foul stench of their rotting flesh and protruding bellies inhabiting your senses Because we end up back in th century Europe in a heartbeat   gt What should be addressed is how to enlarge the middle and high classes not how to distribute their wealth All politics and emotions aside I believe a non interventionist environment that fosters economic growth where people can provide for their own services is a much better solution than distributing those services through the government  So you can imagine when Romney says  I don t care about the very poor and means that they have a safety net so that he need not be concerned with their wellbeing that is taken to mean he does not seek to provide a path from poverty into the middle class He thinks that deregulation will accomplish this transition on its own and there s no evidence to suggest that it will The wishful thinking of trickle down economists doesn t count as evidence Cheney s era of deregulation yielded  years of a steadily increasing income disparity and wealth consolidation Government while admittedly heavy handed at times has historically yielded positive results when used with temperance and caution 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is this different from disturbing the peace

PoliticalDiscussion, gt all raising taxes does is entrench classes  I don t understand how you can make this claim when the greatest expansion and flourishing of the middle class  in the history of the world  happened during an era of much higher tax rates from   yet as taxes have been progressively lowered since  the median income of middle class households has stagnated and barely grown at all while the wealth accumulated by the top richest segment of the population has exploded  I m fairly liberal but I would be all for Romney s  victory of the unfettered free markets and a low tax paradise to make things better for everyone  message if I was surrounded by evidence that it had worked so far  the reality just seems to be the exact opposite I m not morally opposed to keeping taxes low I m just following the evidence that seems to suggest it has done nothing but disadvantaged the middle class and weakened the state of the the entitlement system while benefiting a select few 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s an amazing bubble you live in 
PoliticalDiscussion,If hell freezes over we will elect an actual vulture capitalist that made the majority of his money buying up companies on credit that he loaded the debt for onto the company he bought selling of all the companies assets and bankrupting the company and all the shareholders and destroying all the jobs  Ya Mr Rmoney sounds like the  perfect republican candidate    
PoliticalDiscussion,Nice attempt at political discourse Gnome Sane thanks for letting everyone know exactly just how much respect we should give your opinions 
PoliticalDiscussion, I can t deny my statement  societies with greater wealth redistribution have a higher standard of living   is simply wrong in plenty of cases  Where would you rather live  Hong Kong  Singapore  Sweden or Finland  Based on what I know of those places I d rather live in Scandinavia  Maybe you would prefer Singapore but that s a value judgement    As to your question When was the freest and most philanthropic period of American history  I m guessing you and I aren t going to approach this in the same manner  After thinking about it for  minutes I decided the freest period of American history was the second half of the  s  the sexual revolution and the civil rights era had left lasting changes on society for women and minorities but the arrest and incarceration rates for drug use hadn t ramped up to  s levels  The draft ended in   Obviously nobody was dealing with the counter terrorism erosion of constitutional rights bullshit we have today    As for the most philanthropic period of American history  To the best of my knowledge that would be the present  My understanding is that Charitable giving is very high for Americans both in Raw dollars and per capita  
PoliticalDiscussion,Relevant  link    According to this they differ on issues such as the Bush Tax cuts the role of regulators Obama is pro choice while Romney is pro life Overall though I think both would have similar presidencies in that they would be moderate and willing to compromise at the cost of pissing off their base once in a while  something I believe has already happened to both candidates  
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like you re thinking short term Yes one can say that we can raise taxes today and tomorrow we can address the problems of the sick uninsured and uneducated The only problem with this is that it could potentially create an entire class of people that become dependent on government intervention in their lives giving them no incentives to work any harder when they can live their current life that they re mildly satisfied with  Here s one thing I know our government is in an insane amount of debt and taxes won t erase it Our government just almost shut down over budget disputes and it won t be the last time we go through a scare like that My goal is that if when the government does finally shut down or implement massive spending cuts that I won t personally be affected I hope I don t get reliant on government handouts because those are things I have no control over That s the basis of contemporary fiscal conservatism  that the economic environment should be such that people can thrive on their own  Most scholars will tell you that the president actually has little to do with how the economy works and shouldn t The times in our nation s history when we ve had the lowest levels of unemployment were because of trends developed in the private sector  and indirectly because the government had no authority over the private sector  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re oversimplifying Romney s message His argument is that free markets less regulation and minimal government interference in the lives of citizens generally results in people being able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps instead of receiving entitlements from the government  I suppose a large part of this comes down to tax rates A lot of people argue that it s unfair that a relatively small amount of individuals hold so much of the wealth in this country and as a result ought to pay higher taxes to fund entitlements they ll never see However that doesn t fix the structural problem that allows only a few people to benefit from the financial system in the first place  all raising taxes does is entrench classes  What should be addressed is how to enlarge the middle and high classes not how to distribute their wealth All politics and emotions aside I believe a non interventionist environment that fosters economic growth where people can provide for their own services is a much better solution than distributing those services through the government 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Societies with more redistribution of income have higher standards of living  You might want to qualify that statement because countries like North Korea have a very high redistribution of income How is the standard of living there Small homogenous societies of like minded gentle white people have been able to execute socialism fairly well In most other cases it does not work There are also counter examples to your statement such as Hong Kong and Singapore which have the freest markets in the world and high standards of living   gt Economic progress is not a zero sum game  However the relationship between force and rights is You cant use force without violating someone s rights When was the freest and most philanthropic period of American history  If you want to redistribute wealth redistribute your own If you want to redistribute someone else s then dont complain when they find ways of stopping you

PoliticalDiscussion,What threats  Global warming A weak real estate market The  threats we face today are so minor compared to the issues we faced  years ago it is unfair to even use the word  threats  because the existence if civilization is not under any serious threat  which was not true  years ago  Let s take a random example  Greece Greece is in turmoil right now and is a symbol for the financial instability of the world s debt based system  years ago Greece was ruled with an iron fist by a right wing military junta 
PoliticalDiscussion,sounds like a terrible example of humanity to be honest
PoliticalDiscussion,Feel free to look at our conversation that kelustu and I had and how good his arguments are when confronted   Beautifully done by the way Gnome Sane just like always 
PoliticalDiscussion,and how are we handling the current threats we face today 
PoliticalDiscussion,It wasn t funny I was being sarcastic I do not wish to converse with you as you re comment was childish and did not contribute to the debate in any way All you did was make a stupid joke about  CHANGE ROFL I SO FUNNEE HERP DEERP  I for one think Obama has done and hope he will continue to steer the country in the right direction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Has Romney made statements to this effect I know Obama has downplayed a lot of the talk of war and called out Republicans on war mongering talk but was Romney one of the ones calling for war 
PoliticalDiscussion,Such as what
PoliticalDiscussion,Wuh How is one a liar and the other is not Obama made campaign promises that he blatantly has not kept 
PoliticalDiscussion,Funny or not I wasn t lying 
PoliticalDiscussion,There we go I was hoping for a valuable post This is what I love to see a two sided view on the subject offered   The only thing I can ask is why do you think Romney wants to  bring everyone up  As far as I have understood it he still wants to keep Bush s tax cuts and to continue a tax system preferable for the  higher valued tax payers   I agree that he wants capitalism to work but that s pretty standard I don t think many candidates in the US political system wouldn t want to see growth and capitalism to work out   As for Obama spreading the wealth seems pretty standard for his views which is fine It sounds great but I ll agree with you that it just won t work in the long run I wouldn t say that the democratic party has taken a complete stance on financial equality but rather on social equality Instead they have taken the stance of  fair taxing  which is a debatable term instead of a regressive tax which we currently have  I hope I kept this post as unbiased as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,fair enough I realize the Cold War was awful  and I wasn t alive during that time  The main message of my post was that the people running the world today are not doing their part to ensure the best future for the next generation of leaders and citizens
PoliticalDiscussion,Congress passes legislation not the president Things work out a lot better when the president works with congress rather than fighting them every step of the way Just ask Clinton 
PoliticalDiscussion,War with Iran is much more likely if Romney wins

PoliticalDiscussion,Against No matter what my state will go red It makes voting for anyone other than a Republican a purely symbolic act Solution Popular national vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,The definition of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No but it fits the version of the story Zimmerman is telling and doesn t fit the story that he chased Martin down and killed him in cold blood Certainly it contradicts many claims being made about the incident and is an important piece of information to consider 
PoliticalDiscussion, Ross Perot supports your response 
PoliticalDiscussion,Healthcare though is a perfect example The idea in America seems to be a service cannot exist unless someone is going to be making a huge profit on it which I think is total bullshit and Americans seem to think we can t have a small mix of government provided services education prisons healthcare social programs and still have a booming bustling private sector Basically what I m saying is that the conflict we have with healthcare is this it is hard for an insurance company to profit off of your sick mother so what do they want to do when she gets sick They waant to eliminate her coverage right They want to deny her their service because it isn t profitable to them That should not happen In our country if we continue to have private sector health insurance it will continue to be a failing business model because they simply won t be able to provide their services at a decent cost and still make a profit for shareholders So instead of propagating this kind of sham we should just nationalize it and if anyone takes the hit it can be the government A government should not be a profit making industry so providing services that the private sector cannot should be the first priority of government That can exist alongside a regular capitalist market it doesn t have to be either eveything is government run or nothing is in fact a healthy mix would probably do a huge world of good for America  I am not saying gas stations and grocery stores and clothing stores also should be ran by government obviously THAT would have a negative effect on the economy but freeing up a failing business model that cannot succeed in a non profit capacity like healthcare would more or less be cutting off a diseased limb from our national tree branch and allow it to grow stronger  I believe it is a misconception propagated by the media that it cannot be both ways Americans seem to think nothing can be provided by the government without everything being provided by the government but this isn t true and I m not saying that but we CAN have our cake and eat it too in this resect We CAN allow the government to take a more essential role in our country without our country suddenly becoming a third word communist society It s just our government officials receiving all kinds of kick backs from their corporate owner friends who want to continue to overcharge you for health services so they can continue to reap profits from a non profit based business model that is telling you otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting link  I wonder what s happened to  John since     if the authorities have spoken to him again since whenever it was that he told the newspaper that he talked to them  It still doesn t say that Zimmerman was attacked from behind though  
PoliticalDiscussion,Water is universal to human life freedom is a complex concept that is not at all universal to human life 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think a much more reasonable assumption would be that the man attempted to detain the kid and the kid fought back  But without any conclusive evidence of that it s just an assumption    gt my belief is that if you chase me down a dark ally and try to detain me you are committing assault and I am free to defend myself  That s fine but without any evidence that Zimmerman tried to physically detain the kid it s all speculation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Water is not universal to life Freedom is more than a political state 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That s just an absurd amount of speculation You could never prove murder or manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt without some evidence that Zimmerman actually initiated an illegal physical confrontation  Assault is not physical battery is I think the chase amounts to Assault    gt And I could see a jury thinking that is a plausible enough explanation to introduce reasonable doubt   I think a much more reasonable assumption would be that the man attempted to detain the kid and the kid fought back The evidence certainly point to that The man said  these assholes always get away  he clearly pursued the kid and the woman on the phone with the kid at the time says that the man stopped him and that the kid felt threatened  IANAL but my belief is that if you chase me down a dark ally and try to detain me you are committing assault and I am free to defend myself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it s a false dilemma obviously but I would choose Orwell  I think freedom loses a lot of its appeal when you have nothing at your disposal  The ability to prosper to pursue  happiness  depends on an infrastructure being in place to allow that to happen  You re talking about a situation where you re barely able to achieve life let alone happiness

PoliticalDiscussion,Here is how it will look different from Day   From Mitt s campaign      When Mitt Romney says that fostering job creation through economic growth will be his top priority from his first day in office he means it While some elements of his plan will take time to set in motion much can be done from a running start On Inauguration Day he will submit a jobs package to Congress consisting of at least five major proposals and will demand that Congress act on the package within  days using every power at his disposal to ensure its passage He will also take immediate and specific steps within his sole authority as president by issuing a series of executive orders that gets the U S government out of the economy s way The goal restore America to the path of robust economic growth necessary to create jobs    Five Bills for Day One  The American Competitiveness Act  Reduces the corporate income tax rate to  percent The Open Markets Act  Reinstates the president s Trade Promotion Authority to facilitate negotiation of new trade agreements The Domestic Energy Act  Directs the Department of the Interior to undertake a comprehensive survey of American energy reserves in partnership with exploration companies and initiates leasing in all areas currently approved for exploration The Retraining Reform Act  Consolidates the sprawl of federal retraining programs and returns funding and responsibility for these programs to the states The Down Payment on Fiscal Sanity Act  Immediately cuts non security discretionary spending by  percent reducing the annual federal budget by  billion    Five Executive Orders for Day One   An Order to Pave the Way to End Obamacare  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and all relevant federal officials to return the maximum possible authority to the states to innovate and design health care solutions that work best for them An Order to Cut Red Tape  Directs all agencies to immediately initiate the elimination of Obama era regulations that unduly burden the economy or job creation and then caps annual increases in regulatory costs at zero dollars An Order to Boost Domestic Energy Production  Directs the Department of the Interior to implement a process for rapid issuance of drilling permits to developers with established safety records seeking to use pre approved techniques in pre approved areas An Order to Sanction China for Unfair Trade Practices  Directs the Department of the Treasury to list China as a currency manipulator in its biannual report and directs the Department of Commerce to assess countervailing duties on Chinese imports if China does not quickly move to float its currency An Order to Empower American Businesses and Workers  Reverses the executive orders issued by President Obama that tilt the playing field in favor of organized labor including the one encouraging the use of union labor on major government construction projects
PoliticalDiscussion,In response to your answer to the axe murderer example an alternative to lying to  protect the common good that I like is not to lie to the axe murderer per se  Obviously you don t indulge his question but you still tell the truth by saying  Even if I knew I wouldn t tell you and if you ask again your answer will be a bullet   
PoliticalDiscussion,You obviously have no sense of bird law I m clearly the one who s right here 
PoliticalDiscussion,But then you are assuming that it is beneficial for a government to provide services to the people instead of the people providing it for each other If you have a state that has monopolies over multiple industries because they are providing for the people then you have a loss of innovation due to loss of competition   In a global environment a nation acting in this way would be required to compete internationally or put up trade barriers I personally see an isolationist viewpoint as an unsuccessful one but that s just me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh How about  an eyewitness  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt if Trayvon did try to confront Zimmerman  as Zimmerman claims  wouldn t Trayvon be within his legal rights to do so under the  Stand Your Ground law since he was being stalked by a grown man with a weapon  No he can t physically confront Zimmerman for those reasons alone because Zimmerman was not committing any unlawful behavior 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends on circumstance and situation Freedom is important but it s not always the most or only important thing to consider Security and safety are also high on the list and sometimes those matter more than liberty Sometimes the opposite is true as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay tell all the people who are suggesting water and oxygen then They re missing the point of the question I was pointing out the flaw in the kinds of answers they have been giving  For me freedom is more important than any other ideal I view any form of slavery servitude as repugnant and demeaning

PoliticalDiscussion,I do find the corporation joke somewhat valid we do tend to criticize big corps but still purchase their products   I feel the reason young people don t get involved in politics is because they don t know much about it and the effect it has on society It isn t really taught in high school and unless you study social sciences in college people just don t become that familiar with the political process  or at least enough to become passionate about it It is only once people enter the  real world that politics seem more connected to everyday life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure  Here   
PoliticalDiscussion,Like I have said earlier in this thread I would rather someone tell me a disappointing truth than a blatant lie Romney isn t going to make anyone rich neither is Obama but at least Obama isn t the one saying that type of shit
PoliticalDiscussion,I mentioned in an above comment that our current concerns may be less confrontational in the violent sense  at least in the st world  But many of our problems now require the international community to actually work together instead of one part of society defeating another part  The world is  freer  I see what you are saying but do you feel that is due to the people who control the political  economic sphere or is it more due to recent grassroots uprisings around the world of which a large contingent are younger people who want to change the status quo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where exactly is that proven I have never heard of such a thing what I do know is that countries with a strong taxing policy on it s citizens also are able to rovide the most services to the people services that the private sector cannot provide without a profit margin involved like health care In my mind this does an economy a great service it gives the citizens something they need at a fair cost and takes a failing business strategy out of the private sector It gives the citizens the ability to focus on other aspects of spending instead of those citizens paying a huge chunk of money into a private insurance company that is struggling to turn a profit by assisting medical problems illness whatever they are able to take those funds and spend it elsewhere   How can you say the tax system we have in the US is regressive when it has been proven that more taxes  more government spending  a more solid economy Anyone knows economies with the highest taxes Australia Canada Northern Europe all have more stable economies than the US and have for a long time  
PoliticalDiscussion,No  the basic necessities of life are a given You really cannot think in a political context if you cannot breath What ideal What goal is more important for man to strive for than freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Clearly he had every intention of apprehending the kid and that act the act of apprehension is the  first punch that lands him squarely on the side of the aggressor and thus unable to use the self defense argument  That s just an absurd amount of speculation You could never prove murder or manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt without some evidence that Zimmerman actually initiated an illegal physical confrontation   gt You seem to be making the assumption that this man chased the kid down at which point the kid stopped and they both had a conversation and then the kid punched him I can t see that happening  Really I could And I could see a jury thinking that is a plausible enough explanation to introduce reasonable doubt   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well hypothetical ethical quandaries are seldom praised for their realistic premises  Again if it were up to you to make the decision I doubt you would be so sure about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I enjoy growing my own food specifically tomatoes I grow many varieties of heirloom tomatoes I can hundreds of quarts every summer It s one thing that I truly love I would trade many of my rights away so that I could continue doing this thing I love I would rather be able to grow a garden than own a gun for example I d rather spend an afternoon making red sauce than protesting some injustice  I would gladly forgo voting to spend that time staking and weeding around my plants A lot of people are like this They have things that they do that are more important to them than the more philosophical rights they possess as free americans In  years I ll be dead I d rather die happy than free 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our current concerns may be less confrontational in the violent sense  at least in the st world  But many of our problems now require the international community to actually work together instead of one part of society defeating another part  Our ability to work together to solve problems has been laughable even withing our own communities and nations The prospects of our global community working together seems even more dim 
PoliticalDiscussion,he would take some  in the perspective we are talking about he would not take many
PoliticalDiscussion,They are part of what insures our individual freedoms  Without this  freedom is just a momentary state dependent on ones might and or absence of danger   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The initial escalation of force whereby Zimmerman directly disobeyed a directive from the police officer to stand down and not give chase warrants a breach from any application of stand your ground law  Sounds like armchair lawyering to me The news report I watched specifically stated that dispatchers advice to not follow Trayvon was only a suggestion and there was nothing in the law stating he could not continue to follow I ll see if I can find it for you but they were very specific on the point that the police could not compel Zimmerman to break off chase

PoliticalDiscussion,The emotion or do you know a stripper 
PoliticalDiscussion,The freedom to starve is no freedom at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,So these things are not choices for you but requirements 
PoliticalDiscussion,To a lot of people security matters more than freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion,I figured it was a choice between  guaranteed food water healthcare clothing vs Freedom  Freedom is the assumption that you take the risk of starving dying of thirst exposure or sickness  But not necessarily a complete lack of access  With your choices it s more like  Food or death   Healthcare or death   water or death  
PoliticalDiscussion,This isn t about what you can say it s about where and when you can say it From   Snyder v Phelps     gt The church had notified the authorities in advance of its intent to picket at the time of the funeral and the picketers complied with police instructions in staging their demonstration  The picketing took place within a  by  foot plot of public  land adjacent to a public street behind a temporary fence  That plot  was approximately  feet from the church  where the funeral was held  Several buildings separated  the picket site from the church The Westboro picketers displayed their signs for about  minutes before the  funeral began and sang hymns and recited Bible verses  None of the picketers entered  church property or went to the cemetery   They did not yell or use  profanity and there was no violence associated with the picketing   gt The funeral procession passed within  to  feet of the picket  site   Although Snyder testified that he could see the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral he did not see what was written  on the signs until later that night while watching a news broadcast covering the event  No one was contesting that there were time and place restrictions on free speech in that case it was about the distinction between public private speech and whether you could sue for emotional damages  Edit From   Ward v Rock Against Racism    which bears a much closer resemblance to this law   gt Lest any confusion on the point remain we reaffirm today that a regulation of the time place or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government s legitimate content neutral interests but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so Rather the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied  so long as the    regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation   So to argue against this regulation you would have to argue that it doesn t serve a legitimate purpose that it s not content neutral that it s narrowly tailored or that it doesn t leave other avenues of complaint open  this is the four part test  I don t personally agree that this law violates any part of that four part test but I d be open to arguments that say otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Secondly nobody ever seems to notice this but one thing that probably will never happen is that our national debt will never be as low as it used to be this is because over time more people are born the nation grows population increases etc   While I agree with much of your analysis this part in particular is wrong  We are at or near zero population growth when you discount immigration  When immigration is included we are at  growth rate annually 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I do wonder though  if we had a serious food shortage so that say  of the population would die of starvation in the next year unless the other  were to cut back on their food consumption would you agree to let the government tell you how much you can eat so that more people can survive or would you say that s an unreasonable infrigement on freedom Would you say the same thing if you were in the vulnerable    Yes I would remain consistent  But only because I feel this scenario is a bit of a false premise  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s supposed to be a hypothetical that condenses the choice to  food or freedom or  healthcare or freedom or  water or freedom  It s not meant to be realistic which is why it leaves no room for food outside this society 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You live in the wilderness and are starving and thirsty and will die of sickness or hunger or thirst You cannot and will not find any of the above in the wilderness  That s a false premise  I can find ever one of those things save for  healthcare however ambiguous that may be   gt You have the option to join a community and live in prison like conditions but have access to sufficient healthcare and nutrition and hydration Do you do it  No  What is life without freedom  I d rather take my chances with my wits and strength than live in a box being told what to do  
PoliticalDiscussion,He could certainly He wouldn t have a chance which is probably why he didn t do it the first place That and he still thinks of himself as a Republican  For a Presidential candidate to have a chance of success he  or she must have a nation wide network of well organized people who can campaign for them fundraise for them publicize for them and everything else collectively known as  Getting Out The Vote    The two major parties have this network in place from top to bottom from precinct committeemen to local and state politicians to Senators and Representatives all of whom have  plug my party s presidential candidate in their job description  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I think we ve agreed to stipulate that you d at least be giving up your freedom of choice since I am assuming you would rather have government rations than nothing at all  I m speaking in the context of a pure libertarian society that necessarily leaves some people destitute on the street because of how the free market works  This would be a safety net  I do wonder though  if we had a serious food shortage so that say  of the population would die of starvation in the next year unless the other  were to cut back on their food consumption would you agree to let the government tell you how much you can eat so that more people can survive or would you say that s an unreasonable infrigement on freedom  Would you say the same thing if you were in the vulnerable   
PoliticalDiscussion,To add to this a friend of mine in the military commented to me that the US military teaches them that the purpose of government is to have a monopoly on violence  They teach that this is required both internally and externally as they teach it 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a stupid question  Obviously everything is on a sliding scale  Certain freedoms are worth less than certain other things  I m okay with losing my freedom to purchase nuclear bombs in return for living in a world where lunatics can t buy nuclear bombs  I m okay with losing the freedom to keep  of the salary I receive in return for certain government services provided to me  Obviously there are limits to those preferences but the answer depends on the specifics what exactly am I losing and what exactly am I gaining in return 
PoliticalDiscussion,You live in the wilderness and are starving and thirsty and will die of sickness or hunger or thirst You cannot and will not find any of the above in the wilderness You have the option to join a community and live in prison like conditions but have access to sufficient healthcare and nutrition and hydration Do you do it What if you have water and are healthy but no food Pick  of these three and tell me you won t join that community  You have to freedom to choose what you eat You get the bare minimum to drink and the bare minimum in healthcare You must do what they tell you to do but you have the freedom to leave and go to the wilderness again 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Democracy is a system of government  Not in the way most people think of government these days Democracy is decision making by the people 
PoliticalDiscussion, The one time this poll was done    that I know of  Ron Paul was taking significantly more votes from Romney Santorum than President Obama  Edit  Another more recent poll from Pew     One from NBC WSJ   from November They all say the same thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,He wants to fix the Republican Party not ruin them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t believe anyone is defending this piece of shit Zimmerman
PoliticalDiscussion,Sometimes prison is a pretty dumb punishment It s not entirely unheard of to have someone commit a crime on purpose to get into prison for the food shelter etc Sounds stupid but it happens 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also all  the polling   shows that he would get crushed and hand the election to Obama That s somewhat dated but I doubt it s changed in the past three months 
PoliticalDiscussion,Comparing social organization  freedom slavery etc  and biological necessities  food water shelter etc  is comparing apples to oranges Otherwise we can go reductio ad absurdum You know what s more important than water Electrostatic force which holds atoms together More important than electrostatic force Physical existence reality 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of things   I d rather be a slave on a tomato farm than free in a place where I can t grow tomatoes
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh Obama was the  anti war candidate in  and look how that turned out His foreign policy has really been no different than the president before him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Freedom from government in regards to anything economic matters less to me than freedom from corporations 
PoliticalDiscussion,If these things matter more than freedom then that means my freedom can be curtailed in order to have those things   Food  Does this mean I can choose what food and where I get it from  Or is it going to be some Gov t provided pink meat slime with a side of green algae slime because it s what they determined to be best for me and the environment   Clean water Again   gov t provided  Rationed to a few liters a day     Shelter Do I have a choice in shelter  Or am I shoved into a housing project like so much cattle   Clothing Do I get freedom to choose my clothing  Or is it one size fits all designed to conserve resources and be bland   Healthcare  This can go a long way   do they control my food  When I sleep  When I poop    I guess when you put it the way you did I assumed those things were more important than having Freedom so I viewed them in the context of giving up my freedom to have them  
PoliticalDiscussion,Being alive 
PoliticalDiscussion,without life freedom is unattainable Clearly water is more important than freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indeed Even a libertarian would concede that prisons can and should be maintained to punish murderers and rapists but I doubt they would argue that prisons should be devoid of water food and health care 
PoliticalDiscussion,Joy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I asked my dad about this a few weeks ago  who is quite logical and skeptical  and he assuaged my anxiety about this bill by informing me that apparently never have we had the right to protest in front of protected buildings This bill was passed to tighten up the wording of the original bill because the first one only restricted protesting if someone KNEW they were in a restricted area now it doesn t matter if you know or not But essentially we have the same amount of freedom as before minus the freedom to be ignorant of the law 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uh I m not sure where you get your info from but Obama has indicated he has no intention of letting the Bush tax cuts expire in their entirety The only place Romney and Obama differ is in letting the cuts expire for income earners over  k  To give you a picture here letting the tax cuts expire for the wealthy would only give us about  billion in revenue in the next decade If they expired for everyone  which no one is proposing  it would be    trillion in additional revenue over the next decade In comparison we re seeing a  billion increase in our deficit  this year alone due to Obama s payroll tax cut and unemployment benefit extension leaving the projected  deficit at   trillion     Source    But this is really a debate of another topic so I ll digress   The point is if the biggest difference between these two guys is  billion in tax cuts over the next  years when we re looking at   trillion in debt by then even  if they expire then I d say there pretty much the same guy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that strengthens my point since we re willing to take away someone s freedom  of movement anyway  but not their basic necessities 
PoliticalDiscussion,I doubt that very much  I d like to see you prove me wrong  It s much easier to say these things than it is to follow through  Also I didn t know we were talking about actual enslavement or person ownership  Maybe we should agree on where the line is between free and not free before having this discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul is not really running for president  He just wants to influence the Republican party and political discourse in general  so that his issues are front and center  Running as an independent would be less effective since it would make him easier to ignore 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Republican convention is in August I believe  At that point it would be too late to get an independent party on the ballot in enough states to make a difference   This is just one of the ways the rules are rigged to fight third party candidates 
PoliticalDiscussion,But to say that a republican party presidential victory is more likely to bring us to war is valid as the Obama administration has warned against military action in Iran 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well being happiness and satisfaction  Progress 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only people Romney will be making rich is the   who are funding his campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d rather be free and be sick dying homeless then be a well taken care of pet slave  But that s just me  
PoliticalDiscussion,I dunno man  Compare the world today with the world  years ago and today is infinitely better  In  World War I was raging economies were uncertain and conflict   real  conflict was brewing everywhere  Japan and Russia were at war Europe was on fire the Middle East was brewing  Heck even the US was dealing with terrorists like Pancho Villa who were attacking our Southern border  While all this didn t happen in  it was all in the same time period  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oxygen 
PoliticalDiscussion,A broad interpretation dilutes the meaning of the Constitution while a strict one narrows our rights  The key is consistency in interpretation  An example of an inconsistent broad interpretation revolves around the following   gt The nd Amendment was made in a time when guns took a minute to load and fired one shot therefor it s out dated and doesn t cover today s military arms  Whereas the same interpretation when used on a different Amendment   gt The st Amendment existed in a time when only printing presses were the primary form of media but it is reasonable to assume this protects the rights of internet television and radio outlets  So in one fell swoop one Amendment is expanded because of modern conveniences and one is diminished 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea that s unreadable Thanks though if I ever get out of work I ll look at it then  Edit I think this quote from the report says it all    gt   There is no comparable loss of support for Obama among either liberal or moderate and  conservative Democrats   
PoliticalDiscussion,Understood I know all the evidence is not in and in another post you enumerated a list of evidence that would make the circumstances surrounding the shooting much clearer  I will reserve my opinions as only opinions until I get all the facts   gt Not to knock you re expert testimony regarding audio and human vocalization but this is a big leap How a dude talks on a phone and how he screams when he is being attacked are two totally different things  Since he is of latino decent I imagine zimmerman yelling would sound more like Cheech Marin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Supreme court would should probably rule this unconstitutional as well
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obama is not telling anyone he will pay for their car their school or their mortgage and he certainly does not condone people  partying it up on welfare I am sure   Are you in another country or something                    Those links all reflect my Mortgage School loan and Car statements   gt This will probably be the last political post I ever make on reddit asinine backwards rednecks like yourself just really depress me  I literally only read the two lines I quoted I noticed this one and laughed Typical reddit obamaton Throws a tantrum and runs away   gt I hope Romney does win the election  Don t we all

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The wishful thinking of trickle down economists doesn t count as evidence Cheney s era of deregulation yielded  years of a steadily increasing income disparity and wealth consolidation Government while admittedly heavy handed at times has historically yielded positive results when used with temperance and caution   Thank you for pointing this out 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is no requirement for definite proof We need proof beyond a REASONABLE doubt The voice screaming was clearly not that of Zimmerman We heard Zimmerman s voice and he had a mature low adult male voice The voice of the screams had the high pitch cracks of a person still in puberty By high pitch I do not mean falsetto which can be ouputted by most fully mature male adults I mean ranging between alto and soprano which I would say that Zimmerman most likely cannot imitate given his register  Not to knock you re expert testimony regarding audio and human vocalization but this is a big leap  How a dude talks on a phone and how he screams when he is being attacked are two totally different things   gt Those few panicky people are called witnesses and their accounts were dismissed by the police According to you justifiably so I understand debating an issue and trying to maintain objectivity to reach a fair conclusion however you are not doing that You are just dismissing evidence in support of Zimmerman because you feel that he is some sort of victim   when in reality he stalked an murdered an unarmed youth    Yes because it s so clear cut  s
PoliticalDiscussion,Would private organizations like the Red Cross be more effective at helping those who cannot pay for services  EDIT I accidentally deleted the wrong double post You can see what I in it below 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow this is a brilliant reply thanks for vocalizing what I had failed to You are right about the communication being off for the latter candidiate his message is not as powerful because it does not offer anything in return That is actually what I think is really sad about society why do you have to get something in return Why is it that nobody should have a bus pass unless you need a bus pass Why can t we all just have bus passes in case we need them It s sad   
PoliticalDiscussion,Add bribing Judges to your list   Pa Judge Sentenced To  Years In Massive Juvenile Justice Bribery Scandal     gt Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella Jr was convicted of taking  million in bribes from developers of juvenile detention centers The judge then presided over cases that would send juveniles to those same centers The case came to be known as  kids for cash    gt The Pennsylvania Supreme Court tossed about  convictions issued by Ciavarella between  and  saying he violated the constitutional rights of the juveniles including the right to legal counsel and the right to intelligently enter a plea   gt Ciavarella  was tried and convicted of racketeering charges earlier this year His attorneys had asked for a  reasonable sentence in court papers saying in effect that he s already been punished enough

PoliticalDiscussion,get out of here we don t need your racist talk
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t  as part of accepting a tax base is knowing that I  and others can receive certain services even when i cannot pay for them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really you think my view is skewed And I say yours is skewed Obama is not telling anyone he will pay for their car their school or their mortgage and he certainly does not condone people  partying it up on welfare I am sure There is a difference between the President saying  I think school funding should be affordable to everyone and  I am going to pay for your school  Let s use this as an example What Obama has done with school loans was he removed the banks from the process so there are no extra fees to pay to banks and no middle man involved This lowers the amount of money that students pay for the loan and allows them to repay the debt directly to the government rather than a bank Romney would be opposed to this he would probably want to change this once in office and turn these type of loans back over to banks so that the banks are getting the interest on the loans as well as charging the student more in fees in order to create a larger profit margin for the bank shareholders I am opposed to that some things can be made to profit in business but certain aspects of our society should not be for profit models such as schools and healthcare So in regards to this example Obama is not only  teaching you to fish  he is also giving you the tools to do so and at a lower cost to yourself just by taking the banks out of the process So Romney may be teaching you to fish as well and also giving you the tools to do so but Obama is only charging  for a fishing pole because that is how much it costs to make a fishing pole Romney is charging you  for the fishing pole  for the cost  to pay an employee to make the fishing pole and  for the shareholders so they get a nice little profit from the deal And you re saying you d rather have Romney s fishing pole  Same fishing pole  just costs more with Romney   Obama and his supporters like myself are not for  taking the big man s fish just because they are too lazy to fish themselves and I think this is probably less true for Obama than anyone else the man has worked hard to get where he is today if you know anything about his personal history you would know that But if a guy has  billion fish and the road to the market he uses to sell his fish is crumbling there s nothing wrong with asking him to help pay to get the road fixed so he can make it to the market to sell his fish in order to make his billions in profit It would benefit him directly to do so and of course all the other people who also use the road to get to the market in order to buy the fish That is what taxes are about those who benefit from the economy of the United States paying back x amount in return for the privilege of being ABLE to take advantage of the economy and make a bunch of money in the first place  I am appalled that you think Romney is more supportive of the working man than Obama Obama IS  IS IS the working man Romney just came from a wealthy family He didn t have to do ANYTHING to get where he is today all he had to do was be born into wealth He didn t work extra hard in school to get into Ivy League his dad paid for it On the opposite Obama IS the byproduct of hard work and equality programs in the US He DID have to study hard to get good grades in order to qualify for loans and grants for his Ivy League schooling AND he had to work while he was doing it You think Romney had to do any of that  Fuck no You think Romney cares more about your bottom dollar than Obama  Fuck no Romney cares about Romney and he could give a shit less about you unless he could squeeze money from you somehow but hey if you think he s your buddy then well I was going to say  good for you but no instead I m just going to say I m sorry because that is sad   The mortgage business I also support banks fucked up big time and who suffered Not the banks the people who bought the loans So what s wrong with the government stepping in and saying hey sorry this bank over here fucked you instead we are going to do x y and z to help you so you DONT turn into a homeless fuck It was not their fault that their mortgages suddenly went from  a month to  a month   As far as the car thing all i know is there was that Cash for Clinkers business and his also supporting Detroit when it was about to go bankrupt and economists all around agree those were both successful actions that helped save Detroit and assisted in the economic recovery  This will probably be the last political post I ever make on reddit asinine backwards rednecks like yourself just really depress me You sit there and say my view is skewed and blah blah but in reality it seems like everyone who even comes on reddit and says anything about politics already has their mind made up and won t read a post with an open mind and think hmm thats a good point maybe that s really the way we should be looking at things instead they are just like STFU UR DELUSIONAL   I hope Romney does win the election and I hope he fucks over America so fucking bad that everyone realizes how good we had it with Obama in office
PoliticalDiscussion,Lincoln was unsuccessful with his businesses too and yet he s seen as one of our nation s greatest presidents An unsuccessful business is far more impressive than someone who sat in congress not taking a stance on practically anything Furthermore Fox didn t endlessly praise him Conservatives in general don t hold a high view of him and they certainly don t put him in the same tier as Reagan It s obvious you don t and didn t watch Fox News at all Many of the opinion shows would criticize him for things they thought he messed up on in speeches and things they felt that he messed up on throughout his presidency He did do some conservative actions so they agreed with those He was called an idiot despite having a far greater education than the vast majority of Americans and going to the same school as Obama He also became president when we experienced the worst terrorist attack and a natural disaster He was criticized by liberal media for not jumping up and screaming at kids about how people had just been killed when he was informed about   and as I understand it the Katrina problem was largely caused by the agencies that were handling it such as the issue with all the trailers they bought Not everything is directly attributed just as every bad thing that has happened in this country isn t placed solely on Obama   However when Obama goes out of his way to show support for things like Solyndra and to point fingers at other people then yes he receives a lot of criticism The difference is Obama knew what he was getting into he knew what was going on and made promises he couldn t keep Bush received plenty of criticism by Fox and other conservatives and he lost support from his base They haven t changed their beliefs even in regard to Obama They don t criticize him for keeping the fight going on in the middle east they criticize him for the way he addresses it and he has spoken in the past about the event The big anti fox movement got bigger once the elections began coming up because suddenly it wasn t just Bush and the occasional congressman they complained about 
PoliticalDiscussion,Back of the head on the back small difference  It does show he was being beaten which doesn t help the case of Trayvon Martin anymore than it hurts George Zimmerman 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But without any conclusive evidence of that it s just an assumption   Its an educated guess based on the words of Zimmerman and the role he was playing int he neighborhood One can infer that he started it

PoliticalDiscussion,So a rich rapist can rape all he wants as long as he can pay off the victims   We have no right to remove dangerous people from our lands  That s a scary thought 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have heard the argument that I should have no right to stop my  year old from walking out of the house and going to live under a bridge To allow me that right is to allow me to imprison my poor child   pure lunacy

PoliticalDiscussion,Romney does not say he will make anyone rich He says he will try to create an environment that is more friendly for business to hire and expand Will that create wealth in the population It should I agree But that is a far cry from Romney  making us rich He is teaching you to fish  Obama promises he will pay for your mortgage he will pay for  your school loans he will pay for your car  if it s the  right car    and we have a documentary video from the daughter of Nancy Pelosi with welfare recipients partying it up in line waiting for their  ObamaBucks    He doesn t give a shit if you know how to fish Obama will take the rich man s fish and hand it to you He promises And he does so because it is  fair   Your title is so skewed to the awesomeness of Obama s reasonableness and Obama s historical greatness that it is hard to take your question seriously You completely twist the reality of the situation in Obama s case and describe him as the opposite of what he is and you flat out lie about Romney trying to make it sound like he is selling snake oil in the wild west

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I never equated him to a dictator but his foreign policy positions belie the fact that we live in an interdependent world that necessitates regional and global involvement for every country Those that do not  or are not permitted to are doomed to fail  That s a terrible interpretation of his policies  There is a distinct difference between isolationism and non interventionism  What he wants to avoid is the typical US involvement we ve seen in   Bosnia  Iraq   Afghanistan  Furthermore with the Cold War being over and European Union being more organized is there a reason to maintain a troop presence there   gt Post script There s no reason to be so defensive he s a political candidate The thing that makes him the most like a North Korean dictator is this cult of personality  I figure most folks who enter the political spotlight and aspire to be more than a dog catcher tend to develop a cult of personality  Ron Paul is no different from the current sitting President in that regard or any other political leader

PoliticalDiscussion,Which don t give us much aside from a few panicky people some screams and a gun shot  Can you definitively prove the screams were Martin s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is that just conjecture on your part or is there evidence to back it up  The wiki article on the shooting gave a different view According to it witnesses gave testimony that Martin was on top of Zimmerman They corroborated Zimmerman s story that he didn t chase Martin but got out of the car to check what street he was on  although this witness later reversed her testimony so that s questionable   And Zimmerman was  bleeding  I should have been clearer about that Bleeding from the face and the back of the head suggests that he was hit while his head was against a wall or the ground as if someone were on top of him  
PoliticalDiscussion, My biggest difficulty in interpreting these results is that it doesn t tell me how many people fall into each cohort I don t know if there were more independents than Democrats for example so I can t tell if a bigger drop among liberal independents is of more or less significance  What it does give credence to is that as of the data collection  probably November based on a January poll  it s hard to navigate on my phone  there certainly were some single issue voters out there I have to think that a boom or bust or stagnant summer will sway these voters though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Constitutions need to be flexible and able to change over time which the American Constitution is however I don t personally believe that a Constitution is in anyway useful  For instance Snyder v Phelps in     Basically the Constitution allowed protesters to actively protest and aggravate a grieving family after the death of the soldier the Supreme Court held this right up by almost a unanimous decision The Constitution has often been used to rationalize morally unjustified conduct such as protesting at a soldiers funeral whilst I am anti war I also think it s disgraceful to allow that kind of conduct over a soldier who died protest at the politicians is fine protesting at private family affairs is not  The Constitution doesn t guarantee you rights it ranks your rights and allows the words from  to control actions today the right to abortion isn t guaranteed by the constitution yet the right to bear arms is  I personally wouldn t want a Constitution that legally accepts slaves as   s of a man specifically designates voting to middle to upperclass whites only and consigns women to a derogatory role  The Constitution of a country needs to be constantly evolving and so yes Obama may be  destroying the constitution but it doesn t mean it s necessarily a bad thing that he is changing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you even know what an  enlightened despot is Expanding your horizons is a good thing Mr Pen

PoliticalDiscussion,The Electoral College system is thoroughly outdated as is the delegate system for the Primaries if you are electing a single person then the Electoral College system tends to work most of the time but it can skew election results and forces a  Party system whilst the Electoral College system isn t necessarily a bad thing it certainly doesn t add anything to the current system apart from making it more expensive and possibly changing election results as in Bush v Gore  Main Reason for being against it is that it tends to give a huge amount of power to the swing states if a State is  Republican it doesn t matter that a  rd might be strongly Democrats as they will not get a say though this is the case for the majority of states for the few that swing each way every election it means the Presidency is basically dependant on those few states though being from a certain State can also be useful usually the home state of the candidate will vote for him no matter if they are democrat or Republican as was the case with Reagan and California  Basically the electoral college system is outdated and useless in its current form to improve it you would want proportional representation or better yet rely just on the national vote   Though in all honesty it s not a massive problem the actual electoral college has only ever changed an election result twice since  so it s not as big of a deal as is voter apathy a First Past the Post  or Winner take all system is

PoliticalDiscussion,Just because you do not follow traditional Christian morals and are against alternative family structures does not mean you are promoting a broken home or single parenting  The fact that you presume it does shows you have no opinions on this beyond simply what you ve been told 
PoliticalDiscussion,The purpose of that show was to try to get an understanding as to why a senior politician is disregarding scientific evidence and using incorrect notions of science to influence his politics The point was to discuss the fact that these politicians are disregarding what is actually settled science and acting in a manner contrary to what the scientific evidence has shown

PoliticalDiscussion,Not to mention that Obama is still a disappointment on the war front  He followed Bush s plan exactly in Iraq  after trying and failing to get an extension  and even after the drawdown in Afghanistan there ll be more troops than when he started 
PoliticalDiscussion, Here s a more recent one   from mid January by Pew  it s hard to get good polling because no one really thinks Ron Paul will run third party anymore  I think for liberals the key issues that would swing them to Paul are their opposition to drug laws their opposition to wars and their concern over the state of civil liberties The only one of those that has substantially changed is the war one and that s still a big concern because of worries about whether Obama would go to war with Iran or not 
PoliticalDiscussion, Wounds on his back  you made that up  Its not reported anywhere

PoliticalDiscussion,Against   gt Does the electoral college work  If by  work you mean distort the popular vote for no good reason then yes the EC works wonderfully   gt If you are against why  Every vote and voter should matter equally The EC makes it too easy for that not to be the case   gt What are some solutions  Optimally we would just get rid of the EC and elect the President by national popular vote But that would require a constitutional amendment which is a PITA  An easier reform is to keep the EC in place but just have  electoral votes worth of states agree to award their EVs to the national popular vote winner and that is exactly what some people are trying to do   lt    lt    lt 
PoliticalDiscussion,That right there is the crux of the problem my definition of freedom is way different from yours  So before we can get at what matters more we need to agree on terms  My notion of freedom is the unfettered ability to become all that I can be to realize my potential  This can be hindered by government by individuals and by business interests alike  
PoliticalDiscussion,The poll you posted above  I assume your source was taken late last autumn before troop reductions began in Afghanistan or  the drawdown in Iraq began in earnest I have to imagine that people who would have voted on this basis alone no longer have a reason to vote for Paul 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt To characterize him as simply anti nation building is grossly inaccurate  As is to characterize him as some close minded North Korean dictator   
PoliticalDiscussion,The White Savior Industrial Complex  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose and the   back of the head  and had wet grass stains on his red jacket    Police arrival  Yeah   really made that up   
PoliticalDiscussion,His isolationist views extend to foreign policy aid and trade To characterize him as simply anti nation building is grossly inaccurate 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt i e businesses must be color blind  Which is technically unconstitutional  The commerce clause did not exist for that reason but to ensure interstate commerce was unimpeded  Businesses are privately owned entities so why should they be forced to do business with those they do not wish to The Commerce Clause is one of the most abused aspects of our Constitution due to a broad interpretation of it s power     gt While I personally regard such a broad reading of the Constitution as a good thing in this case   This one tiny little good thing is not worth the additional power granted to the Gov t to allow it  Sorry but I d rather deal with businesses trying to exclude minorities than to allow the Gov t more power to control every little thing which may be considered  commerce   This is the kind of thing which allows crap like the War on Drugs to continue 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think avoiding things like  nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan necessarily equates to the type of isolationism we see in North Korea  That s a bit of a stretch in terms of your interpretation of Ron Paul s position don t you think 
PoliticalDiscussion,  WHITE HOUSE GHOST BELIEVED TO BE WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON TURNS OUT TO BE RON PAUL  
PoliticalDiscussion,True  But I ll have lived an interesting  albeit short existence while you live in a box for the rest of your days being told what to eat what to drink what to wear when take your pills  I ll take that chance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that makes totally sense because a name like mine is as inflammatory right off the bat as the original name that Cletus jor Roy or whatever his name is came up with before posting the thread Right on man 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you would barely scrape by in the wilderness for the rest of your life probably ending up dead long before your time  I think by and large people do still prefer oppression to savagery 
PoliticalDiscussion,While Ron Paul is hardly a Republican he still is one officially   RINO status  If he runs as an Independent it might be that he loses any privileges and status he enjoys within the GOP   In the end I don t think he s really out there to win This is really him using the nominating process as a soapbox If he had any intention of making a real run he would be out by now just like Jon Huntsman Sure Newt is still in but it s only to pester Romney and have some status at the Convention Paul will be in this to the very end No one with real aspirations would continue with the amount of delegates that Paul has 
PoliticalDiscussion,So really you re asking   What is more important than freedom excluding all the things that are more important than freedom  
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep up the good work friend
PoliticalDiscussion,The emotion I feel when I m with strippers 
PoliticalDiscussion,North Dakota It s gone blue once in the last  years and that was after JFK was assassinated McCain won there by  points in  Santorum got around   Voting for Obama there is a fruitless act which is completely meaningless Which is why I vote third party with a good conscious  D
PoliticalDiscussion,The polling data disagrees with you In fact if you go talk to the people on  r ronpaul many of them say that they would otherwise be voting for a Democrat Now if you said that Santorum would be stealing votes exclusively from the GOP nominee then I might agree with you But I don t believe that to be the case for Ron Paul both from talking to his supporters and from looking at the polls that have been done 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sounds familiar     
PoliticalDiscussion,His only appeal to a liberal mindset is a diminished  or nonexistent role globally for the US  including its military   This equally turns people off because of how myopic a view this is of the US contribution to the world and ignores the fact that no country can survive in the modern world as a closed system  see North Korea  
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see how he s trying to do either He has no more political capital with his own party as he does with the other You can count the number of bills he s sponsored which have passed in recent memory on one hand 
PoliticalDiscussion,HonorAmongSteves made the  same point  
PoliticalDiscussion,No one is waffling between President Obama and any of the Republican candidates If any of the GOP candidates ran as independent he d be stealing voters from the nominated GOP candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion,That isn t true Self defense like insanity is called an  affirmative defense  meaning that the facts of the case are not in dispute When such is the case the defendant bears most of the burden of proof barring some obvious exculpatory evidence  the dead person was running at you with a knife for example  
PoliticalDiscussion,Anyone have a better idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure that s fine But there will obviously be situations where that wont be possible like if you don t have a gun  also Kant would argue that you can t kill anyone because of the categorical imperative and therefore if you threaten to kill him you are either lying by threatening something you will not do or you re threatening to violate the categorical imperative regardless  so why not lie   I think the goal should be to come up with a blanket statement that can apply to as many cases as possible In this case I think it would be    As a general rule telling the truth is the right thing to do However there are circumstances that can make lying the right thing to do   If you accept that statement as fact then from that point on all that remains is to enumerate the circumstances that make lying okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,candidates not presidents    Bush was a bumbling  buffoon who was unsuccessful with EVERY business in his life and had to read everything he said    but they made it seem like he was a  leader yet Obama is just a community leader and teleprompter president Unbelievable  GWB didn t even finish his fucking National Guard duty Imagine if that was OBAMA    
PoliticalDiscussion,So no wounds on his back  Just kind of made that part up did you after all this pontificating about what people do and don t know   
PoliticalDiscussion,Go to  r economics  r economics and this topic has been discussed at length While we scoff at these  sweatshops there is a reason why workers flock to these jobs Namely they offer far better pay and working conditions than other employment opportunities available in these areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d say the  rule of government matters more when the government restricts individual freedoms in order to   Establish Justice  Insure Domestic Tranquility  Provide For The Common Defence  Promote The General Welfare  Secure The Blessings Of Liberty To Ourselves And Our Posterity
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the shooter will be convicted of murder in a criminal court  I think the family has a good chance of winning a wrongful death lawsuit though 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s another totally different case What I m asking here is whether keeping people from protesting in certain places   Serves a legitimate state interest  Is content neutral  Is narrowly tailored to meet the legitimate state interest  Does not prohibit other forms of expression  The case you linked   Reichle v Howards  is a different issue from the time place manner restrictions question that will be answered if this protest law goes to court  In  Bivens it was established that you can sue federal agents for violating your constitutional rights even if they re not breaking a law The question to be answered in  Reichle is whether you can still do that if they have probable cause  which the courts have said that Reichle did in this instance  That question has already been settled in other realms but the nature of Secret Service is that they have to make split second decisions and would be less effective if they were worried about getting sued A more thorough overview of the case  can be found here   As this case hasn t been ruled on yet I can t say whether I agree with the court s decision though if I were on the Supreme Court I would probably rule in favor of Howards 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are not being open to another opinion viewpoint I will be stopping this argument as it is not in the spirit of this subreddit 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A broad interpretation dilutes the meaning of the Constitution while a strict one narrows our rights  This isn t exactly true as it is through the Commerce Clause that Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of   under Johnson  That Congress has the power to force private businesses  even those owned and operated within a single state such as a restaurant to abide by the Civil Rights Act In   Heart of Atlanta Motel v United States   a broad interpretation of the Constitution established the principle of equal rights in business  i e businesses must be color blind  While I personally regard such a broad reading of the Constitution as a good thing in this case  there are other cases notably   Kelo v City of New London   that many people  including myself  view as examples of overreach by the Court and by the elected bodies that use the Court s ruling to justify their actions 
PoliticalDiscussion,For it I like that California and New York can t completely control everything You need like  more states though so I m not sure how much better that is 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would he He s clearly right wing Might as well try to cash in from republican voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Against  I m totally behind  this plan   It d be simple be a true national popular vote  at least for the required electoral majority  fair and there is no reason it d be found to be illegal as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,As Does Pat Buchannan in   along with confused elderly Floridians 
PoliticalDiscussion, In some cases It s unfair to let a murderer go free It s unfair to let a stranger beat a young child 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am for it for the same reasons I am for each state getting two senators regardless of population  Without these provisions we will be adversely ruled by the sections of the nation that are densely populated  These two provisions provide check   balance against that 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you d take a boot to the face for the rest of your life rather than trying on your own  Interesting   
PoliticalDiscussion,Is freedom unfair 
PoliticalDiscussion,They were both jokes One got far more attention than the other 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem then becomes that certain prisons gain a reputation for being the  easiest to break out of  IE bribe the prison get a free trip to the border  The incentive is to convict as many people as possible then offer them an easy escape for a price This could easily be done under the table and who s going to stop them The government Not under your system The convicts Why give up their easy ticket to freedom The employees Why risk their job and who are they going to report to Eventually because all the convicts are choosing these corrupt prisons over others they will be all that s left 
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually Bush did the TARP plan   well somebody under his administration did   sorta   
PoliticalDiscussion,Many of them do not say they will be voting for a democrat Some do but not many 
PoliticalDiscussion,He has not promised he would not 
PoliticalDiscussion,He did not end the war in iraq The agreement was sign under bush 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think ottawadeveloper is arguing that power is to be taken away from the individual and given to the collective but rather that it is to be distributed between both and that giving it solely to individuals can have pretty serious consequences It s also misleading to say that the majority in this country pay no federal income tax since there are many other taxes collected that are regressive and not progressive  e g sales gas state and local taxes  and it doesn t consider their current well being Maybe it says more about income distribution than it does about people s avoidance of federal income tax  Regarding your example with your neighbors I understand the argument but am interested to know if policies similar to that have been implemented anywhere and what results they had You say that your neighbors could elect to sue you so am I to assume that the court system that we have now is currently in place Courts seem to be a historically slow process  although incredibly important in determining legality  so it would seem redundant for a court to hear multiple cases regarding people starting a polluting factory in their backyard Perhaps they would make laws surrounding it Regardless if there was a court somebody would have to enforce the ruling since we can safely assume that a powerless court would not change anybody s actions So it seems to me that by implicitly arguing that your neighbors can sue you there must be at least judicial and executive  in the sense of enforcing the law systems if you assume that the judicial system also legislates If you don t then we have these three branches and we get back to the argument of scope 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt education reform   Is that why half of the adults in Detroit are  functionally illiterate      gt and altruism in government   Good grief 
PoliticalDiscussion,The skit seemed primarily designed to make fun of members of the audience It s hard to place in context but I did hear  this is as much diversity as we ll ever get at  lt this school gt    Surely you see the difference between this and calling some random college student a slut and a prostitute because she had the gall to try to testify before congress   Compare with all of the stupid jokes that don t get a big fuss 
PoliticalDiscussion, Congress doesnt pass legislature Congress IS the legislature Congress passes  legislation    No the right to protest does not mean the right to block an entrance disrupt someone s business or otherwise be a dick You should and will get arrested for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,You preferred the Cuyahoga river when it was occasionally catching on fire from all the crap that unregulated businesses dumped and pumped into it  You prefer your skies to be permanently smog colored    You re hilarious 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh what a surprise pulling a bunch of random links from anti liberal major media all propaganda bullshit
PoliticalDiscussion,I just wanted to let you know I posted a pro liberty prison response in this thread in case you are interested It s actually a little less complex then our current system as well cheers  Private vs Free Market Prisons  
PoliticalDiscussion,Rush calling Ms Fluke a slut was a joke in poor taste We all see how big of a deal that was  Bill Maher calling Sarah Palin a cunt was not a big deal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you saying nobody should vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,conscience   
PoliticalDiscussion,Ideologically equality matters as much as freedom Thinking of a world where people are perfectly free  you can do whatever you want versus a world that is perfectly equal  you can only do as much as anyone else can be fun   Political nerding  
PoliticalDiscussion,I knew the Florida population was old but I didn t know they were  years old   
PoliticalDiscussion,I am also in the center  A large part of what he has done in my mind is to try to get both sides of the aisle to work together Obviously he was elected President so he will push his agenda but he has been willing to compromise This is not an easy task especially when the other side has zero respect for you 
PoliticalDiscussion, Al Green   
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you mean liberalism as in economic liberalism  free trade or liberalism in the American sense which people today essentially equate with left wing ideology 
PoliticalDiscussion,True or lies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like how you ve written that question as if you re literally asking for permission   p 
PoliticalDiscussion,Either or I see too many resources spent on states that have enough  to deal with their own  relatively minuscule problems Since they are selfish don t give them that power Equal power per person Power concentrated where the people are 
PoliticalDiscussion,First off  you took my second quote out of context which I don t appreciate You ll notice I gave an example immediately following the Civil Rights Act  which you don t think is a good thing  of what I perceive to be overreach  Second businesses operate within the society that we  the citizens and the Constitution lays out Without society and law no business would be able to operate no matter how  private they declare themselves to be 
PoliticalDiscussion,if you actually WATCH the video you can see tom hanks is EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE with the blackface guy wandering around  calls him  Bill Oreilly NOT as a compliment and the jokes and even says  Hey  Easy  about the sensitivity training joke etc to try to nicely shut them down  He goes on with the auction because he is the MC but he CLEARLY tries to dampen the whole blackface stuff and comments  He say s  ouch at further tasteless jokes and tries to talk over the other guy with the blackface man making all the jokes It s ridiculous to say Tom Hanks supported the activity in ANY WAY He clearly tried to dampen it and play it down and physically distanced himself from the obnoxious pair making the jokes  starts at  on video     ooid VscwNDprpBprPdpVVHKcLTn MkXY
PoliticalDiscussion,I think some people are afraid and or ignorant 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem when considering free market prison systems is modern  private prisons skewed the perception about how  true free market prison systems would work Remember business is  all about incentive so lets observe the two systems   Modern Private System The incentive in this system is to lock up as many people as possible as punishment they get more money for the  greater number of people they hold That is  very bad because it leads to problems we have today   Free Market Prison System Remember only non aggressive force is legal in this system and the Government  is not involved in  any form The incentive will then become producing the  most rehabilitated detainees Individuals that have committed a crime would be required to pay for their stay themselves  through insurance fair wage labor etc  What we will then see is prisons actually  competing to entice prisons to come their prison while having detainees is important producing  positive results is more important because prisoners can  choose where to go  There is a stark contrast between the systems if you have any questions please feel free to ask 
PoliticalDiscussion,Modern liberals have given us the welfare state the regulatory state and the nanny state How anyone could consider any of that a  good thing is beyond my comprehension 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you afraid that given your scenario all political power will be concentrated in the densely populated states leaving the rest without any real representation     
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama has passed health care reform a monumental task that has eluded Presidents since Nixon  He ended the war in Iraq  He reversed Don t Ask Don t Tell  He saved the US auto industry  He arguably prevented a depression  He killed Osama bin Laden  Plus he sang a credible Marvin Gaye Cover onstage at the Apollo 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am against it for the same reasons I am against each state getting two senators regardless of population With these provisions we are  adversely ruled by the sections of the nation that  have no people  Minority rule Yea 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what happens when there are great natural resources and nobody wants to live there because of the weather  Nobody needs help we can all do it on our own 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives do the same thing to liberals with little or no controversy   This was a joke in poor taste not a big deal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Federal Government isn t always the best at allocating resources but I don t think we should be afraid to let them use tax revenue to fund important non profit programs doing a service for our society When you combine that money with private donations you can have really robust efficient services  I completely agree we need programs to help society But government isn t  able to run these programs no matter how moral and just the end goal it just isn t possible Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were extremely moral causes yet it was inherently flawed as a program because the system isn t restricted by market forces   gt The benefits of living in a functioning society with a safety net and basic services like disaster relief preparation is more then worth it to me I might object to other spending but that s the problem with living in a society with other people You don t always get to decide but at the end of the day everyone is better off  Is everyone really better off in our present society though Sure we have comfortable lives but couldn t there be  better ways to help everyone   gt Taxes aren t a new concept and we have a system of representation even if it s an imperfect one My bigger problem with the tax system is the loopholes and exemptions created to appease various interest groups and corporations It s overly complicated for a reason If you slashed those exemptions you could easily lower taxes in the US  You are touching at the problem indirectly but we have a lot of common ground here I just take it a little further Not only should we cut exemptions we should eliminate  mandatory taxation altogether We know that Government cannot solve problems  efficiently OR  effectively  wouldn t it be more effective to spend our own money to solve problems locally from the ground up 
PoliticalDiscussion,This shit again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Equal rights are a good thing but liberty   The condition of being free from restriction or control    is impossible in a society greater than one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fucking great  I have a short attention span how many are there What s the best 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure I m parsing your conclusion correctly  I suspect a great deal of voter apathy is caused by the Electoral College I started voting in Maryland and like you say  my vote for president did not matter at all I voted but I m sure more people would have if they thought their votes counted 
PoliticalDiscussion,The difference is they for example could say that democrats want to legalize stealing if you are below a certain income Clearing a lie But no one has the standing to sue they can always just say  Oh not THAT democrat But some democrats  It would be a blatant lie about the news that they d never go to court over 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Federal Government isn t always the best at allocating resources but I don t think we should be afraid to let them use tax revenue to fund important non profit programs doing a service for our society When you combine that money with private donations you can have really robust efficient services   The benefits of living in a functioning society with a safety net and basic services like disaster relief preparation is more then worth it to me I might object to other spending but that s the problem with living in a society with other people You don t always get to decide but at the end of the day everyone is better off  Taxes aren t a new concept and we have a system of representation to make our voice heard even if it s an imperfect one My bigger problem with the tax system is the various loopholes and exemptions created to appease various interest groups and corporations It s overly complicated and leads to unfair taxation based on lobbying ability rather then legitimate economic social interests If you slashed those exemptions you could easily lower taxes in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,It appears to be the same logic that allows for the targeting of specific Americans overseas as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Life 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t agree with this In  he was doing that but this time the intent behind the campaign is definitely to make him president as is shown by the strategy to go after delegates where he can get them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s kind of a win win situation for President Obama either way   If the individual mandate is upheld then the conservatives who have spent the last  years calling it unconstitutional look like idiots or liars It s also a reaffirmation of a major accomplishment for the President I think many Americans like capable leaders more than they like the political substance of what they accomplish Simply that he was able to take on such a huge issue successfully casts him in a positive light among some independent voters who don t really have strong feelings either way about the legislation I also think it plays into the Obama campaign strategy of targeting women voters in November No matter what Obama does he has lost the white un educated voters who are primarily the ones against his HCR legislation If you take them out of the equation the majority of female minority and educated whites support it  If the individual mandate is struck down then we re going to have a debate over health care reform again and from what I can tell the Republicans still don t have any credible alternative to offer They will have to take the responsibility for undoing the provisions of HCR that everyone seems to like  pre existing conditions extended coverage for young adults no medical spending caps etc which is not going to be politically popular among a pretty wide swath of voters Again this goes back to pleasing the un educated white males who were going to be voting Republican either way I also believe it will do a lot to solidify the President s base support The political narrative of selfish Republicans taking away people s health care benefits plays pretty well among the base even if they don t love all the details of the President s HCR legislation  
PoliticalDiscussion,I completely understand your argument I am just posing hypotheticals to encourage debate  Is government using force against its population worth the benefits it produces 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why the hell are comments like this downvoted It s a political discussion subreddit 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s awfully condescending for someone that doesn t understand the premise here  The question is what would happen if Paul ran as a rd party candidate in addition to a Republican nominee in a race against Obama  not what would happen if Paul were the GOP nominee 
PoliticalDiscussion,CIA rules What are you talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion,Terrorists are not political leaders  They are categorized as enemy combatants  Therefore drone strikes are not assassinations but rather legitimate military action against hostile enemy forces  That s what the DOJ has argued anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This means that during economic cycles the ability to provide healthcare  or any service will not depend on people s voluntary contributions but rather be provided in the implicit social contract from living in a nation  Isn t the concept of the Social Contract similar to the concept of Divine Right The Government has been given the power over the land by  the people  King Louie was given power over the land by  god  In either situation why is it  they who get the power over the land and the people within that land Might it be more effective to give every individual power over  only themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,You keep saying that we don t know what happened and then making up facts that support your case as if any juror with common sense won t know who went out that night looking for trouble because of all the spooky scary black men in his mind and who was out buying a bag of skittles a can of ice tea and walking home 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like liberalism I don t like modern liberalism though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve had this argument before I ll just say that any reduction in taxes would go to a number of different resources People don t typically get a tax break and then donate the entire thing directly to a charity They look at their finances and try to plan for their future while giving what they think is reasonable to their favorite charities  There s already a very robust charity non profit sector in the US that does a lot of good things for our society and people are already willing to donate with taxes as they are right now The main thing hurting the non profit sector is the aftershock of the recession and job insecurity   not taxes In all my time fundraising for different organizations I have never heard anyone mention taxes   Red Cross themselves said the main thing hurting their fundraising is the lack of natural disasters and the misconception about their operations People want to give money to disaster relief   they don t want to donate money so some administrator can work full time ensuring arrangements are in place Preparation is a worthy investment but it s more difficult to sell   Public Private partnerships are a much more realistic starting point because they allow the Federal Government to supplement critical operations during times of economic recession when private donations fall 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it is acceptable Are they allowed to sure Should they no   If a conservative did that to liberals it would be replaying   on most news networks and would be upvoted in  r politics I doubt the same will happen except fox may replay it a few times 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s difficult to use the word objective I think you have an entirely too rosy picture of life without regulation  I don t assume to paint a picture of life that is rosy I am stating that regulation is the  direct cause of the problem not free markets Economies are far too complex for any individual or groups of individuals to control and when it is attempted it  always fails     gt I don t see the benefit to having Google take over roads That is a nightmarish scenario IMHO The free market would never have integrated lunch counters nor given us the  hour work week nor broken up monopolies  Again  government causes the problem of monopolies it doesn t solve it And beyond that government is a monopoly itself  They are the only ones entitled to use force But beyond that Imagine if Government had entered the cellphone market back in  and determined that they would give everyone cellphone they were big and clunked but everyone got one However since it was a Government program there was no incentive to innovate so that clunky cheap cellphone stuck around until  That isn t what happened though and now look what we have more power in your hand then what desktop stations had  years ago    gt The sole reason corporations exist is to transfer wealth from their customers to their shareholders The only way we can trust them enough to provide services to us is through banding together to make rules and regulations on what they can and can t do  Free markets  inherently have these protections built into them it doesn t need a rd party trying to  fix it  Might we necessarily describe our freedom to choose whom we have romantic relationships with a  free market for dating  Every individual is free to seek relationships with whomever they wish and most people seem happy I don t think I have heard of a  regulate dating movement either There is zero government interaction between consenting adults persuing a private relationship and both parties are better off as a result We also do not see one man or woman really  monopolizing the dating market  This idea extends into other industries deregulated industries because the fundamental premise of voluntary interaction remains Eliminating the monopolization on the use of  aggressive force also eliminates the mechanism with which one individual might use legitimate aggressive force against another individual Once that mechanism is gone and the playing field is leveled violence simply becomes unnecessary and more importantly  unproductive and unprofitable  Lobbying to secure legitimized aggressive force is productive but you cannot lobby what does not exist   
PoliticalDiscussion,If you don t care about personal convictions lets talk about national reasons to vote  and get rid of the EC   I specifically voted for Nader in  because my state was so  blue it went for gore anyway my first election to send a statement with full confidence that  my guy was going to win anyway But then gore who won the national majority lost  because of a few hundred votes in Florida an arbitrary  re partisan ending to the recount and Florida specific policies about who was allowed to vote which ended up turning away more people on polling day than Bush won by to begin with  specifically no convicts from florida and texas there might have been other disenfranchisement factors I no longer remember   So even if this clusterfuck only happens once a generation   bleeding Kansas also comes to mind  and even if it only affects the th largest state and even if if your vote is only   of the deciding numbers  just like florida in   the stakes are still very very high for voting and the system needs to be changed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who invokes the violation What do they support 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  good reason for distorting the popular vote is that we re the United States  a federation of states rather than a nation in and of itself There was a big debate back during the founding of the country about the balance of power between the small states and the big states which is why every state gets two senators  arguably a bigger distortion than the electoral college   I personally think that we should rewrite the Constitution so that we remove the fiction of federalism because that s just not how we operate anymore and it s harmful to operate under rules that pretend that But there  was a good reason for distortion of the popular vote even if it no longer applies 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be honest I don t know the advantage with respect to government is  ideally for the most part guaranteed access to these services    I personally do not know who would be most effective at providing service x  Be that health care police jail operation welfare or any government service  And arguing one way or another on this topic is very difficult as there are examples and counterexamples for each  I am far from a specialist  Taxation and forms of mandated service provisions ensure a revenue stream towards services that a society deems necessary  This means that during economic cycles the ability to provide healthcare  or any service will not depend on people s voluntary contributions but rather be provided in the implicit social contract from living in a nation  
PoliticalDiscussion,There s liberalism in America  Where 
PoliticalDiscussion, Stefan Molyneux   video link     has done some amazing work on the topic if you are interesting in how children and liberty mesh    Murray Rothbard   also has some great thoughts on how to handle children in a contract society  No sane person wants children to get hurt or to hurt 
PoliticalDiscussion,If he ran as an independent he would have to spend more of the money people have donated to him instead of laundering it through his  non profit organizations After he does this he can spend the money in ways that campaign finance laws would prevent He did it in  so there s no reason to believe he won t do it again in  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s difficult to use the word objective I think you have an entirely too rosy picture of life without regulation   I don t see the benefit to having Google take over roads That is a nightmarish scenario IMHO The free market would never have integrated lunch counters nor given us the  hour work week nor broken up monopolies   The sole reason corporations exist is to transfer wealth from their customers to their shareholders The only way we can trust them enough to provide services to us is through banding together to make rules and regulations on what they can and can t do  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m just saying that if it comes down to Obama or Romney I d vote Romney   Then you are on board   with a life jacket on ready to jump off at a moments notice    e s
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not on board He s not even the nominee as of yet I m just saying that if it comes down to Obama or Romney I d vote Romney 
PoliticalDiscussion,If every one of the  million US citizens were allowed to keep   more of their wealth would people be more likely to donate to charities and other non profit organizations 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am not trying to be nihistic about it  I am just saying the chance of his vote counting doesn t go up at all by putting it on the national stage  His vote still has almost no chance at  all of counting  I completely agree I vote for those personal reasons  However those personal reasons are irrelevant to his argument  They exist whether or not he is voting in North Dakota or in a giant national election pool  It doesn t change anything  As for recounts and buffering margins of error  The chance of one vote different triggering a recount is equally unlikely and really the thing we are talking about is if after whatever recounts occur happen if this one vote would make a difference  It is completely and impossibly unlikely that one vote will matter in a presidential election  You should still vote but kingvitaman s vote will not count in either system  The argument is about which system makes politicians running for office run in the way we think is healthier for the country  I tend to agree with kingvitaman  But I think the electoral college is bad because of the stranglehold it gives Florida Ohio Pensylvania and a handful of other swing states have over political discourse is unhealthy not because it makes my vote count 
PoliticalDiscussion,EC votes are granted according to state s population already Your thinking of Senators not the presidency   Besides which upstate NY is   of the states population   is rural  the rural part of NY is still larger than most states but has almost completely different interests than the metro area which is composed of  entirely different states 
PoliticalDiscussion,All of those functions are certainly possible without government   gt How exactly would a privatized police department work Would the rich get the  Executive package while the poor get a  Pay as you go plan I don t necessarily like the way we handle national defense but it certainly beats a McMilitary   Market for Security  Bob Murphy   This video is a basic discussion of how it would work and it also discusses many of the possible questions you might have  wouldn t the richest people take over warlords etc    gt Not to mention talking about roads  Have you ever been to Walt Disney World Though it isn t a perfect example  as Disney is the sole proprietor of the property but multiple property owners wouldn t change the premise  it does show how how much  better roads would be if they were privatized Also consider all the other technologies we would have on roads if they were privatized Picture companies like Google and Apple taking over roads I think that would be AWESOME   gt environmental protection or the myriad regulations necessary to form society  If we eliminate the ability for businesses to lobby Government for  regulations  we eliminate the mechanism  aggressive force which allows businesses to prevent competition in their industry That mechanism is what is causing the plethora economic problems in the World right now businesses that should have gone bankrupt didn t competition in many markets is forbidden securing the necessary licenses to start businesses raises market entry costs to prohibitively high levels  its malinvestment and monopolization across the board  All I am saying is when we take an  objective look at the way Government attempts to solve problems we see inefficiency but more importantly  ineffectiveness  We as a society need a more  effective way to organize society one that actually helps the poor by removing the power hierarchy the rich rely on to maintain their wealth We need a society that does not grant a small minority that right to legitimate use of force against peaceful individuals If we as a society accept using aggressive force against peaceful individuals is acceptable we are building a society that  suppresses rights instead of  protecting rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox News is subject to the same libel  written and slander  spoken laws that everybody else is  Thus your analogy doesn t hold  
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing matters if you want to be nihilistic about it but voting matters a great deal on a personal level to a great many people   Besides  considering the sad state of our nation s polling ability recounts happen   a buffering margin of error often matters very much 
PoliticalDiscussion,Glad to have you aboard 
PoliticalDiscussion, Panders to the Republican hawks     I remember when Mitt Romney got on national TV and told the Iranians that  America isn t bluffing   Because that might be construed as pandering to Republican hawks   
PoliticalDiscussion,Hate to break it to you but your vote is kind of a symbolic act no matter what  The chance of your individual vote mattering is so tiny that it almost never occurs  Even the tightest and closest elections where it is down to just a dozen votes your vote still doesn t matter because with one less one more vote it would either be a victory by  or   Your individual vote is always just a symbolic action 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you re interested in Con Law I d imagine MIT might post a course but in short the Executive Branch has broad discretion in forming foreign policy  intelligence trade policy State Dep t etc   The President couldn t withdraw the country from the UN without Congress for example but could diminish America s role and frustrate the efforts of others He could enact trade regulation as protectionist as GATT will allow He could withdraw trade officials and embassy officials in addition to troops and intelligence officials from anywhere in the world   As for the latter half of your comment I assume once R TX  is no longer in the public eye and subject to criticism that the defense will stop I don t care who the subject is though going to someone s defense as a reflex is lunacy One ends up defending acts or positions that are indefensible 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea of having states do it independently sounds good until Texas realizes its electoral votes are going towards a democrat or California realizes there s are going to a republican and the legislature changes their election law back after the election  I don t know if it would happen soon but you gotta admit that it is a pretty janky system if one or a coalition of state legislature can go back on the agreement and change the results That is worse than Bush v Gore because in that instance you have candidates that campaigned thinking the rules were one way and then everything shifts due to post election politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d vote for him just on the premise of ending Obama s healthcare law A lot of the other stuff I disagree with but not enough that it stacks up against that stupid bill 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Gingrich is running as a  Kingmaker  kind of like  give me whatever high ranking position in government that I choose and I will give you all my delegates so you can get the nomination and I will not make your administration a living hell   Maybe but he also has that rich donor behind him and he thinks  and I think that he has a better chance of beating Obama than Santorum does so I think his real plan is to outlast Santorum monetarily and pressure Santorum into throwing his delegates behind him to beat Romney with the promise that as a younger man Santorum will be able to run again in  or   if not as VP this year  In Gingrich s mind the only man who should be president is Gingrich and I think he d rather Obama stay in office than Romney win 
PoliticalDiscussion,Kind of true  The thing is over half of Paul supporters  including me will not vote for the Republican candidate anyway  When Romney comes up  points short against Obama even without Paul running third part Paul supporters will have the last laugh and say I told you so  We ve been ignored but the party cannot win without us 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How about have an aid sit down and read while he quietly says something simple and leaves the room Some fucking leader   to sit there like an idiot while Rome burns   I believe he was waiting for them to bring the car around There s no immediate action he could take anyways Had he of saved  minutes what would have happened Nothing The planes hit he gets hit with tremendous news and has a million things running through his mind No one knew what to do when this happened they were all scrambling Bush gave up golfing after   Obama has been proud to repeatedly take separate jets on constant vacations    gt Bush gutted FEMA and via Crony capitalism appointed  Heck of a Job Brownie   Once again Bush doesn t have absolute control over everything He didn t select every action for FEMA to take he didn t buy the wasted items It was a disaster it should have been handled better but it s not like he was overseeing everything personally    gt How about a fucking dozen solyndras while poisoning and killing our troops Halliburton billed gov for meals not served ran empty trucks across Iraq under US guard for profit provided untreated water even electrocuted our troops in showers Not to mention Forced them to eat  a day at the same time which the insurgency used to mortar our mess halls and kill our troops multiple times  Cost Plus over  BIllion approaching  Trillion in fraud   How does that equal a dozen solyndras Solyndra was an absolute failure that got absolutely nothing accomplished but waste money It wasn t even a reasonable investment It just wasted money on technology that we knew wasn t and wouldn t be ready for use There are risks with every investment but everyone knew this was a bad one Bush didn t personally sponsor Haliburton he didn t go up to bat for them and talk about how great they were Obama went out of his way to sponsor Solyndra and he made on investment like that after he warned us about how important and imperative it was that we absolutely got the stimulus bills He took a bad economic situation and instead of helping the poor he constantly claims to represent he gave some money away that would in no way help them at all   There were plenty of reasons to dislike what Bush did but you re just a mimic olbermann Fox is bad and  bias only because you don t agree with them Other news programs can do the exact same or even worse and yet they get a pass Not to mention stations like MSNBC have a clear motive for hating Fox Fox is their biggest competitor and is everything they were supposed to be You don t call Fox bias because they tell you  sides of a story because they do You call O rielly bias because you don t like his opinion on it I don t like O rielly he s often wrong on his opinion but I get a far greater sense of what happened in situations by watching him than I would on competitor opinion shows You re full of double standards and practically every post you make is about how evil Fox is and how it s the end all 
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t fly with his own party either Even if you support some of his policies he s painfully inefficient at making them come to fruition It s crazy how the  Tea Party adopted this man who kicked around for decades as their figurehead

PoliticalDiscussion,Against Do you have any idea how long it takes for a wagon to reach the capital in New York from Northern New Hampshire or Kentucky The balots are exposed to attacks by sabatours or natives We must keep elections localized to preserve the democratic process 
PoliticalDiscussion,well it s kind of funny to see the only other commenter here is a serial troll but he s back down to less than  comment points so maybe it s a tiny step  clarence thomas should recuse himself from this case for a slew of reasons that are all over print and online media but he probably won t none of the rightwing justices seem to worry about their conflict of interest in the healthcare case or a few other recent ones   Thomas s family has already taken money from the same lobbyists working to defeat healthcare bill

PoliticalDiscussion, gt What you re characterizing as  non interventionism leaves out the fact that Paul opposes not just intervention   but involvement in the world   That is in fact isolationism I m not interested at going back and forth with rhetoric suffice it to say that I think you have a blind spot and you don t believe that you do  How can a President even do that  Even in America s most isolationist period we still interacted with the world through trade  Yeesh   gt   As for the cult of personality I m hard pressed to find knee jerk Obama apologists or defenders outside of his own party   and he suffers a hell of a lot more criticism than the current sitting Representative from Texas and for a hell of a lot less And yet any criticism of than the current sitting Representative from Texas and the defenders and apologists come to his defense like he was their grandfather I can t understand such strident adherence to any person take the policies you like acknowledge the ones you don t and make a choice on who to vote for Anything beyond that is just madness  WHAT   Just go to  r politics for awhile   In all honesty those Ron Paul folks will fade away until the next libertarian candidate comes around  They re pissed because they feel much maligned by their own party as much as by the Democrats  It s called a  siege mentality  
PoliticalDiscussion,First off it is hard to just use that one portion of the Declaration of Independence Thoughts as sound bites is a relatively new phenomenon The next sentence in the Declaration that you did  not quote reads   Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed      They then go and list  examples of why the governance of the king  became destructive to these ends  the ends being self evident truths that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed   SO    Hypothetically if there were a domestic group of radicals bent on abolishing the government they  would be treated as terrorists because our government is not  destructive to these ends  That would be  according to the constitution only a  Just revolution if they can point to similar reasons and lay out their path to  rectify the issue They would be treasonous if for example they were just a bunch of anarchists who wanted no government Or if they were a group of radical fundamentalists who wanted to revert to a monarchy system and abandon  the consent of the governed    or  as Honest Abe Lincoln saw it they wanted to create a caste system of slavery that would make men unequal 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you re characterizing as  non interventionism leaves out the fact that Paul opposes not just intervention but involvement in the world That is in fact  isolationism   I m not interested at going back and forth with rhetoric suffice it to say that I think you have a blind spot and you don t believe that you do  As for the cult of personality I m hard pressed to find knee jerk Obama apologists or defenders outside of his own party and he suffers a hell of a lot more criticism than the current sitting Representative from Texas and for a hell of a lot less And yet any criticism of than the current sitting Representative from Texas and the defenders and apologists come to his defense like he was their grandfather I can t understand such strident adherence to any person take the policies you like acknowledge the ones you don t and make a choice on who to vote for Anything beyond that is just madness 
PoliticalDiscussion,Could It has already happened 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s an excellent question I can t wait to see the answer I can see it going either way a repudiation of Obama could turn into a loss of votes for Obama  EDIT and democrats    OR a repudiation of Obama could get sold as  THOSE RACIST AMERIKKK REPUBLICANS ARE EVIL DON T BE RACIST VOTE OBAMA    and it could work  EDIT for Obama and democrats     Can t wait to see the results 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pertinent section of Florida s stand your ground statute     A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony   Entire thing here     I wonder how the police  and if this goes to trial a jury define  attacked   Does that only include physical contact  Or could an attack be defined as being threatened and verbally assaulted by a stranger who s following you  
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the correct answer   gt You need like  more states though so I m not sure how much better that is   Other states should start increasing their populations if they do not want to get steamrolled   
PoliticalDiscussion,Even before Obama took office conservatives were crying about  moral hazard even though the financial companies had already placed their massive bets and it was too late to prevent the crash  
PoliticalDiscussion,Doesn t matter which way you lean but Rush Limbaugh calling Fluke a slut to  million listeners on sponsored air time is a bit different than Maher calling Palin the C word while doing stand up in a private club in front of  people    Also the first amendment protects the most vile speech especially criticism of those in power of which both men are guilty of The big difference is Rush has sponsors who don t want to support him anymore this is not censorship but rather the will of the free market   no 
PoliticalDiscussion,A fellow redditor created an entire subreddit devoted to cataloging what president Obama has done and sorted by chapter category     
PoliticalDiscussion, I do care about personal convictions  In fact what I said was that personal convictions are the ONLY reason to vote because your vote actually mattering either as actually effecting the vote or as a signalling action is incredibly small     I agree with you that vote signalling is a good way to vote by voting for Nader you were telling democrats that the left is unsatisfied and that they need to embrace some of the ideas of the left wing of their party if they are going to keep them voting for democrats  I agree that this is a very sound thing to do if your state is not in a close election   And I said this already too but I also agree that popular vote is better than the electoral college however I think that you are oversimplifying how much better  Your example of close state elections and potential corruption in recounts is not something I think going to a popular vote fixes in fact it can exacerbate these problems significantly  What happens if we were to have a national popular vote and it came out really really close within just  votes or so  When it is only one state that is close they follow their own recount rules and sometimes they are sketchy and weird but they follow their rules and manage their own elections  unless the supreme court buts in with what it says is a non precedent setting decision and in a completely unprincipled fashion halts a state recount   This process makes a recount normally fairly practical and reasonable and somewhat overseeable   If this occurred with a national popular vote you would need to recount every state potentially every county or every precinct  Every state would be doing recounts and all following their different laws and different standards at once  With one state with a recount every journalist lawyer and media person available is covering and working on it  On a national level there just can t be that kind of oversight  The chance for corruption goes up dramatically  Just simple vote packing becomes effective where as before if Illinois vote packed a bunch and did some corrupt stuff it would just effect their electoral votes now it effects a national pool  This would be a nightmare scenario worse than Bush v Gore and fairly possible  That said I do support a national popular vote still  I just don t think that it will help prevent this scenario you are worried about  So what are the systemic reasons that resonate with me for why a national popular vote is better  I think the big one is that there are lots of significant voting blocks that are not regional  I think you would see presidential candidates start looking at vote courting in a much more subculturalized way  They would want the techie vote or the environmentalist vote  And this process wouldn t be based on which states were swing states but rather based on which demographics can you gain the most support in while pissing off the others the least  This is a fairly different way of choosing what campaign issues to talk about and what groups to court This is a double edged sword but it will also reduce regional issues from forming national policy as much  Florida clearly defines US Cuba policy   The way we talk about jobs and manufacturing is in large part because of Ohio and Pensylvania  We are such a presidentially focussed and obsessed culture that this rhetoric trickles down to races in other states where it makes less sense however voters are primarily exposed to politics through the way candidates court these states  Over time I think you would see this rhetoric change substantially    American Politics is all about Getting Out The Vote  This means rallying your base and to a lesser extent rallying moderates  The trick is to use the issues that mobilize your side but not your opponents  This metric is drastically different on the national stage than it is when looking at the core values of swing states 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see why someone would but I never thought the world depicted in  Brave New World was all that distopian 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama has accomplished a lot of things that I believe are good for the country As with any representative democracy you take the good with the bad and you take the good watered down but I think that under obamas administration a significant amount of good is still left over which is more than I can say about many presidents 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you changed society in the right ways it could work perfectly with any political philosophy munfortunately we don t have that luxury We have to do what is best for society as it exists now and while we can take into account changes that are likely I the fututre we can t rely on specific changes taking place even if we do try and make it happen through policy as we shape the way we govern ourselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah we could do that too The problem is that federalism has been dealt several major blows that make it much less tenable The Civil War was proof that you couldn t really get out of the Union if you wanted to not unless you were willing to sacrifice a huge number of lives  and had superior firepower  which because of our standing peacetime armies controlled by the federal government is never going to happen We also passed the th Amendment which baked some anti federalist ideas into the Constitution itself and opened up the way for lots of federal governance World War II was another one when Americans were all thrust together and a national identity was pushed as a way to help motivate the population and win the war Finally the advent of a large number of technologies made the world much smaller all Americans share the same internet the same television the same music the same movies etc Regional media specialties have been pushed to the fringe which means that the distinction between states has gotten much weaker than it once was  I don t really have a preference one way or another about whether we operate as a federation or as a single nation what I  do care about is that the base rules for how government is run actually work Under this current hybrid system with the rules laying out a federation and the government operating as a nation this is not the case so one thing or another should be changed For the reasons outlined above I think it would probably be easier better for the Constitution to be rewritten  though of course in today s political climate that would be a disaster

PoliticalDiscussion,Ford wouldn t have gone under necessarily but the loss of GM and Chrylser would have put so much strain on their suppliers that there would have been mass layoffs autoparts manufacturers going out of business right and left and those left would have to ratchet up their prices so high that Ford would have been forced to move a huge portion of its manufacring over seas meaning further job losses ford is strong enough in foreign markets that they would stay alive  thanks mostly to the mondeo but the blow to the US job market would have been so hard that they might as well have gone out of business 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  Rockefeller Republicans are now basically the Democratic establishment  Clinton From and the New Democrat Coalition figured the best way to beat the Reagan Republicans was to take those ideas and make form them into the  new Democratic Party  They ve largely been successful in that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes of course They love the myth of Reagan 
PoliticalDiscussion,His opposition Coakley did not get the support she needed from the Democratic party  Given that she was the crucial supermajority vote you d think somebody in DC would have been paying attention  Unless the Democrats didn t really WANT the responsibility of actually   you know changing things 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you have to realize is that this was already a very bloody civil war before we entered We did not start it However we had both a humanitarian and a strategic interest I the region so we intervened Sure it was probably more due too our strategic interests oil getting rid of ghadafi etc  but the intervention brought about an end to the conflict much sooner then it would have arrived otherwise plus we toppled a dictator hated by the majority of his people  not just reportedly hated by the US media but truly hated enough to justify a revolution  with almost no losses to US forces while also acting in the strategic interest of the country that Obama was elected to serve 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just so you know Obama did promise to expand the war in Afghanistan when he was running for office People voted for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  actual Reagan not the myth 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hah I think I am although I m certainly not an idealogical purist like most of them I think for environmental policy for example the government should intervene although in the simplest way possible But for a lot of issues it s difficult for me I think if society were to change some culturally Libertarianism could be a fantastic ideology You just have to change this culture away from its obsession with the self If there was more solidarity and people helped one another more then I think Libertarianism would work astonishingly well But that takes time and it takes education and it takes will 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know that all is bad but better the occasional illegal drone strike than the occaisional illegal war If we have to fight the GWOT  which I m not certain we do but th majority of the country is which in a democracy means we have to than this is really the best way to do it  Also as others have mentioned he did not start the war in Libya but his intervention is largely responsible for ending it shortly after it begun  by the standards of africancivil wars   You have to loose lives to save lives Thats what soldiers are for   Gen James Gavin
PoliticalDiscussion,Forget Eisenhower the Tea Party would hate Reagan for being way too left wing 
PoliticalDiscussion,he did not kill osama bin laden in fact he had almost nothing to do with it seal team six killed osama bin laden
PoliticalDiscussion,the thing is neither Honda or Toyata needed a bailout at the time and even if they had neither were American owned at the time so we would have had much less to loose whereas Chrysler did need a bailout and was at the time american owned The bailout kept them alive long enough to ensure their future survival which even if it did mean a foreign buyout saved a lot of jobs and will mean that if there is a next time  hopefully there won t and there certainly won t be in the foreseable future  it will be less imperative for us to bail them out  Also one of the reasons ford didn t need the bailout was because it was so much stronger in other markets than GM and Chrysler  And even if ford does make some of their cars oversees they still pay taxes in the us and contribute to our GNP the same is true I believe of Chrysler though I m not sure of the specifics of their deal with Fiat which might change that somewhat And both do  or are supposed to pay taxes in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll just leave this here      You have no idea what you are talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion,ford was fine only after GM got bailed out Ford and GM have many of the same parts suppliers therefore the survival of GM was critical to ford as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,ford would have gone under within a week of GM their supply chains are too interconnected  just realized I replied to you twice oh well
PoliticalDiscussion,I see what you re getting at and thanks for the responses but here s what confuses me   We are not  at war because there was no formal declaration of war  unless it s in Afghanistan but even then did Congress ever formally declare  war     What defines an  unlawful combatant  Doesn t this mean we can deem any hostile regime as unlawful combatants   Does this apply to operations against combatants who are hidden in foreign countries If the US were to send in teams to take out leaders hiding out in say Canada would this still be legal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why bother trying to change it The only election where it really affected the outcome was Adams v Jackson and caused the candidate with fewer popular votes to win and it has since been tinkered with to avoid what happened then to happen again The reason Bush won over Gore was because of the Supreme Court not the electoral college The thought of this country making major changes to the constitution in the current political climate are insane 
PoliticalDiscussion,They may not have saved the US auto industry wholesale but it certainly saved what we know today as the US auto industry and the remaining company would be a bit of a monopoly as far as the US is concerned   Of course you are right that Honda and Toyota do manufacture I the US which is a good thing but just because they manufacture some of their products domestically doesn t make them a major part of the US Auto industry Certainly a major player in the US market and a huge part of the auto industry as a whole but I would not consider them part of the US auto industry at least not nearly as much of a part as GM Chrysler and Ford  With your last comment you may have a point but this was not a situation in which there were a lot of options We either had to bail them out allowing them to become the biggest in the world again or we let them fall potentially so far that they could have gone out of business all together which would have been much worse  Edit fixed a few autocorrect mistakes  typed on iphone 
PoliticalDiscussion,The reality is that today Eisenhower would likely consider himself more aligned with the Democrats So his opinion of a group that is considered far to the right probably would not be too high 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Eisenhower wing of the Republican Party doesn t exist anymore It was built in  by Thomas Dewey and Earl Warren after they realized Robert Taft led them to defeat in  It was dethroned in  by Goldwater Buckley types  who were the heirs to the Taft legacy and then by Nixon during this time Nelson Rockefeller led the moderate wing In  the same group from  came back with Reagan as their standard bearer Moderate Eisenhower types were thereafter marked men See Senator Jacob Javits for a great example   Now if you want to go really far out the John Birch Society called Ike a communist even  while he was president

PoliticalDiscussion,No not at all I always vote  I am saying you shouldn t vote because you think your vote will make a difference because that is statistically incredibly incredibly unlikely  You should vote because you think it is a good thing to do or because you care about the issues  But if those are the reasons you are voting it doesn t matter if your vote is a symbolic act and I would argue because your vote will never ever make a difference your vote is always just a symbolic act 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Killed tens of thousands of people and thousands of innocent civilians That was a war Why isn t this    Are you comparing the Gulf War to the Nato Intervention in Libya There is a huge difference A  massive difference We didn t just  bomb Iraq There were troops on the ground and we entered Iraq This was a declaration of war against a  relatively stable nation not against a rag tag group of mercenaries and unorganized loyalists You know because they  invaded our ally    Bombing one side in a civil war is completely different Most Libyans applauded our efforts The revolutionaries totally did    gt Dropping bombs on people is an act of war  This is unfortunately where the semantics come in In many cases an act of war must be declared against the definitive government of a country Really this is all silly Yes it was a war in the colloquial sense But ask NATO UN and US officials and the intervention itself was not an act or declaration of war but it was an aspect of the Libyan Civil War There was no definitive ruling government in Libya and I don t remember any agreements being made when the conflict was over Though I could be wrong on that last part   Really it s irrelevant though I don t know why I brought it up Sorry     gt In any case when you invade or otherwise institute regime change in  countries since  you re bound to have a few where you actually do something right If you think about it it s useful strategically as well You get to perpetuate the myth that you re fighting for freedom democracy and all those other vaunted goals Then you can use that reasoning later even when it shouldn t apply  Very true but your anti American biases make it difficult for me to see objectivity in your statements While there is always an underlying agenda to say that there is no intent of democracy is ridiculous Just for the record I was and still am against both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan I take a mostly isolationist point of view when it comes to foreign policy But hindsight is   History has not closed its chapters on either conflict in the middle east Some good may come of it in the long run It wouldn t be the first time

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Of course it works But it also causes technology to stagnant and over quality of care to decrease Government programs do not get better over time Goods and services provided by the market do  At no point did I say private companies shouldn t exist Private companies have their place and that place is improving competition But why should we abandon the government entirely just because the market exists Companies are never out for your best interest but for making money Why should something that should be a core right  healthcare be tied in with money making That just encourages profiteering off of other s suffering  see American insurance companies  Why should the governmental alternative not be there for those who can t afford something like healthcare Why are Americans suffering from crippling medical bills while I can walk in and get my condition looked at at no cost to me That s simply not fair and not the way it should be    gt This is an entirely false statement  The Articles of Confederation gave the original states more or less sovereign power  state rights  Over it was quickly discovered that each individual state was too weak in its own right So the states came together and formed the constitution and establish the Federal government   gt It s not just the US It is government in general Have they proved  capable of managing the economy Absolutely not Every time the government intervenes in the market they waste resources and decrease the overall wealth of the society Every time the government acts it harms everyone in the long run  Why is it then that European countries with strict government regulations are much more economically stable than the US Why is it that after eight years of de regulation under Bush that the economy decided to collapse It crashed because banks decided they could now get away with faulty loans that they knew would crash Under harsher regulations that sort of nonsense wouldn t cut it In fact the government here in Canada saw it coming and implemented legislation before they could do it That s why we recovered so quickly from the recession   gt I fail to see the point you are making Free markets and technological innovation exploded as a result of a next to unregulated market  What I m trying to say is that solving problems locally isn t as good of an idea as it way fifty years ago We can instantly communicate with each other and transport can be done in under a day Why would we need to solve all our problems locally If the pacific northwest is hit by the big earthquake we ve been expecting for a while why wouldn t we ask the rest of the nation for help instead of solving our problems locally People often argue you can solve problems quickly by keeping them local but with improving technology response time has become much less of an issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Definitely a weaker criticism than the other citations but it s still apt Dropping bombs on people is an act of war If you re going to cite it being a NATO mission or it s lack of ground troops that s pretty weak I mean Iraq in  was a  humanitarian mission under the UN and NATO We bombed that country for  weeks or whatever Killed tens of thousands of people and thousands of innocent civilians That was a war Why isn t this  In any case when you invade or otherwise institute regime change in  countries since  you re bound to have a few where you actually do something right If you think about it it s useful strategically as well You get to perpetuate the myth that you re fighting for freedom democracy and all those other vaunted goals Then you can use that reasoning later even when it shouldn t apply 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are Toyota and Honda American owned No But nether is Chrysler now so if that s going to be requirement to be part of the  US auto industry then Chrysler should be excluded from that   Toyota and Honda manufacture in the US as do a lot of other  foreign automakers Strange how something like the Ford Fiesta designed in Europe and built in Mexico is considered American while the American designed and built Toyota Venza is considered an import foreign car 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or we could try to operate according to federalism We re a big country  different strokes for different folks

PoliticalDiscussion,Toyota honda aren t american and Ford was in a better position going in so they could afford not to take bailout money GM and Chrysler needed it Chrysler surely would have gone under and GM would be in a lot worse shape that they are now A lot more of their brands would have gone under and their situation would probably continue to decay to the point that they may eventually have gone under as well They would probably not be the biggest car manufacturer in the world right now either 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t put it past him Or Romney 
PoliticalDiscussion,healthcare bill was good stimulus is controversial but it stopped the small graphic design firm my mom owns from going under so I m inclined to say it s good to A lot of people say that it stopped the recession from getting worse but wasn t enough to improve anything The first part is true but the second partnisn t because it was enough it was because it was too short term None of the grants were long term investments short term stimulus only They prevented decay but they fell short of leading to eventual growth Auto bailout wasn t decided upon by him I don t think but he did manage it and while conservatives will say it s socialism which I guess is a legitimate concern depending on your definition of socialism it did kind of save the industry which is now not only growing but still a free market enterprise OBL was big Not as huge as people think or some of his other foreign policy decisions  Libya was handled ver well from a strategic point of view as well as an operational point of view  Also I think the world respects us  slightly more after three years under his administration 
PoliticalDiscussion,He really does want to but it requires desire on both sides  In his eagerness to accommodate conservatives he has thrown many of the more liberal principles  ones that I value a great deal by the way under the bus  He has gotten jack shit for his trouble except for an erosion of support from the left

PoliticalDiscussion,Targeted killing is not assassination Assassination is generally defined as  gt to murder  a usually prominent person by a sudden and or secret attack often for political reasons  The targeted killing of unlawful combatants who are taking part in an armed conflict against a state have been ruled to not be protected by the Third Geneva convention Killing them is seen as an act of self defense in the same way that sending an F to bomb some Taliban is   It s really a cold war executive order that says that the US is against murdering people for their political beliefs You d be forgiven for thinking that this might mean that the US is against killing people outside of a warzone or what have you but that s not really a belief grounded in fact or law The US is perfectly happy to kill people and it s legal for them to do so especially in a war which is what the US Government and legal system believes they are in

PoliticalDiscussion,Regulatory states and nanny states aren t real concepts they exist neithe Ron practice nor theory only in rhetoric As for the welfare state you re going to need to be more specific There are several different models of welfare state that exist in most modern countriesnn some from or another in most modern western nations None of them are called well fare states because people there are given welfare the name comes from the concept that the governments priority should be the welfare of the people The Nordic model tends to be the most effective although the continental model has also been very effective  Canada uses a similar model although it has been most effective in Germany  The Anglo Saxon model the first modern welfare state succeeded in making British baby boomers the wealthiest generation on average in the countries history despite the fact that it now longer had an empire to sap the wealth from However it was diluted greatly during the thatcher years when that generation decided they d rather not invest that money in the next generation The modern generation may be richer despite this  I m not sure  because even though the majority have not advanced they haven t gone backwards at all while a privileged minority  which in fairness was always there has risen in affluence The Mediterranean and American models just straight up suck The Mediterranean because these countries don t have the industries for a GDP big enough to support it and the American what because it is just a safety net which is too low and not very taught This is why we associate welfarestate with welfare checks stateside

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I completely agree we need programs to help society But government isn t able to run these programs no matter how moral and just the end goal it just isn t possible    It does so right now as we speak There are good and bad examples but they exist and they are run by the federal government I can give you a list of hundreds of valuable government programs and grants that go toward necessary services and are run efficiently   Most hospitals receive government subsidies to function   especially hospitals in areas with large numbers of uninsured patients If you think private donations will cover these costs you are sorely mistaken Even major healthcare systems that branch out into wealthier neighborhoods would collapse under the weight of the uninsured   especially if Medicare and Medicaid were eliminated Most of our healthcare system would close up shop  The good and necessary programs tend to be overlooked The media s primary function is to root out corruption and report on destructive public policy so that s what we hear about Examples of well spent Federal grants to non profits are rarely mentioned That s why you thought that organizations like the Red Cross were privately funded when they rely on both public and private money to exist  The fannie freddie disaster was bad government policy It wasn t really moral because it created a housing bubble that nearly destroyed our economy They certainly had some good intentions but it s not an example of a pragmatic government intervention It drove up home prices and acted as a subsidy to the housing banking industry    gt Is everyone really better off in our present society though Sure we have comfortable lives but couldn t there be better ways to help everyone  In comparison to a society with no government or taxation   yes I think we are better off We have a legal system that can potentially mediate disputes We have laws to protect people s property We have government regulation to prevent environmental disasters and promote public health  I don t think you recognize what life would be like in a society without functioning inclusive institutions Life would be much worse     There will always be people manipulating the system You can t eliminate the government just because it s imperfect The phrase cutting off your nose to spite your face comes to mind   gt wouldn t it be more effective to spend our own money to solve problems locally from the ground up  Not in all cases It depends on what you are trying to do and the scale necessary to do it If you ve ever actually worked with a local organizations to solve problems you ll understand how difficult it is to raise money maintain participation and meet goals Local institutions are extremely democratic and unwieldly At times even the smallest projects can seem daunting   The Federal Government has the money and power to allocate resources and mandate change across the entire country There are bad and good examples but it s existence is what allows our society to exist in its current state Many hospitals would shut down millions of people would be thrown into poverty food poisoning would increase environmental disasters would permanently eliminate parts of our country and global trade throughout the world would become extremely dangerous   I think you want to frame everything in terms of an ideology about the immorality of taxes but I m only really interested in what we can do realistically within our current framework I d rather focus on increasing transparency and reforming where we can We need to have realistic goals to make a better society Hypothetical discussions about different systems is fun but at the end of the day it has to work There aren t any large scale nations operating on a voluntarily tax model for some pretty obvious reasons

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I completely agree we need programs to help society But government isn t able to run these programs no matter how moral and just the end goal it just isn t possible Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were extremely moral causes yet it was inherently flawed as a program because the system isn t restricted by market forces  See every other first world nation besides the US for plenty of effective social programs run by the government Hell you CANNOT fight against UHC against any country that has it because you will not get re elected if you do   gt Is everyone really better off in our present society though Sure we have comfortable lives but couldn t there be better ways to help everyone  Sure there could be better ways to help everyone You progress by being Progressive not regressive Half the ideas Liberatrians want to impliment have already been tried and failed  Articles of Confederation State Rights gold standard etc    gt You are touching at the problem indirectly but we have a lot of common ground here I just take it a little further Not only should we cut exemptions we should eliminate mandatory taxation altogether We know that Government cannot solve problems efficiently OR effectively wouldn t it be more effective to spend our own money to solve problems locally from the ground up  See my first response Government is extremely capabale in every other first world nation why not the US Just because the US government is incapable doesn t mean all government is incapable Additionally we re not living in the s anymore As technology expands and transportation information travels quicker there isn t much of a difference between working locally and at a distance We can instantly send out a message across a continent within several microseconds Why would we abandon that and instead hope that local people are feeling generous today

PoliticalDiscussion,The health care reform came up short but to call it  nothing is ridiculous  it has made a lot of fucked up situations better 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you re selfish 
PoliticalDiscussion,On paper Barack Obama has had what supporters might call  accomplishments  However these tend to focus on name s rather than substance That is to say a supporter will state that Obama passed health care reform In reality the bill did nothing to solve the health care problem The same goes for financial reform  Lets look a bit deeper  With Health Care reform Obama threw away popular policies that ran into opposition from lobbyists or special interests For example government negotiation of drug prices w  big pharma was something favored by  of the population So naturally in a democracy one might expect this to have entered into any  reform of the healthcare system Well when the healthcare industry came out in opposition to this Obama and his party dropped it  The debate about the public option was similar Widely favored particularly among the unions that had strongly supported Obama s run This was betrayed as key lobbyists throughout Washington denied support   With financial reform you will see something similar In early discussions talk concerning the so called  Volcker Rule was widespread This would have repealed a key component of Glass Steagall which called for the separation of investment of investment banks and commercial banks This would have greatly stabilized the financial system preventing banks from becoming inundated with unmanageable systemic risk However it was naturally opposed by Wall Street as it would have sacrificed profitability Wall Street therefore strongly pressured Obama and other governmental figures to drop the Volcker Rule Naturally it was ensuring that the financial reform package would provide no meaningful reform   The list goes on Democrats will claim that Obama ended the war in Iraq Well if you look at it this was mere happenstance In reality Obama just followed along with George W Bush s timetables Meanwhile he greatly expanded the disastrous war in Afghanistan as well as illegal bombing in Yemen and Pakistan   In contrast with Bush who tortured suspected  enemies of the state  Barack Obama simply has them killed This is perhaps another  accomplishment  
PoliticalDiscussion,THis question is very broad not only because of the various different definitions of liberalism that people have brought up but also due to the fact that it is a very profound ideology in that it encompasses so many different political positions Personally I like believing that government can be a powerful force for good  even if it isn t very active or effective in that role as it exists right now but I guess I m just not a very negative person 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about land grant universities Those turned out to be a decent idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,That was not the only factor in the recovery  A major component was the stimulus bill and that was all Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush had to agree to that it was mandated by Iraq and It was in  Obama actually managed the pullout and got us out of Iraq

PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with both points I enjoy getting glimpses of the subtle political intelligence that Obama s administration employs Allowing the overtly tangible benefits of the bill  pre existing youth coverage to immediately take effect while postponing the rather cumbersome portions of the bill to loom past an elections is a creative bait to tie down a number of the bills opponents I m worried however that if the court allows the bill to stand this will solidify the opponents as they will have a rallying cry for an essential all hands on deck situation to vote out every supporter of the bill they can The politics of taking away health care would not play well however as it almost is the message and spin will be dominated by the right as their mouths almost always appear larger than the lefts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very quickly you go from pretty reasonable statements  people tend to promote and preserve their own interests to absolute nonsense  history shows us there are probably nefarious circles a the heights of power pushing a hidden agenda on an unsuspecting world  This is fantasy  Corruption exists Cronyism exists Corporations serve the interests of shareholders rather than the public good Elected officials like to keep their jobs Frankly I m not troubled by these facts   I have a hard time believing in conspiracies when a black guy from an underprivileged background beats the wife of an ex president and the son of an admiral to become the most powerful man in the world  TL DR try  r conspiracy if you want to talk about things outside the confines of reality 
PoliticalDiscussion,r conspiracy
PoliticalDiscussion,Interestingly I m finding the crux of the opponents legal argument to rest on the notion that the bill is forcing commerce hence the supposed unconstitutionality of the bill I believe this argument rests upon the presumption that the common taxpayer does not wish to have health insurance thus their reason for not having any in the first place While this may apply to a small percentage of the population I think a strong argument could be made in support of the idea that as a majority uninsured Americans would prefer to be insured Seems that providing an avenue into commerce that is desired is not forcing the transaction There also seems to be a preliminary dispute as to whether the penalty is a tax if it is then the justices may have a rather peaceful means of avoiding the case all together under the guise of not considering an argument against a tax until it takes affect I believe neither side wants this to happen as both have filed briefs against that measure however it would be a refreshing change to see the Supreme Court gracefully bow out of influencing presidential elections This measure would certainly leave the topic in limbo however it seems that allowing it to remain a pivotal factor in the next elections would allow the country to effect an electoral recall of the legislature and president if they as a majority truly disagree with the bill I would prefer to see the issue resolved in an election rather than a supreme court case as such I would prefer if the court were able to parse the issue and sidestep a monumental decision which could prove premature in consideration of the upcoming election

PoliticalDiscussion,  CIA could have killed JFK    Not like they definitely did or anything but the official explanation of that event always smelled a little fishy to me  Add in the fact that JFK was the last president who seriously tried to limit the power of the CIA and you have something that while there s not necessarily a fire there s a whole lot of smoke   Along a similar line   The MLK assassination   Ever notice that all through the Civil Rights movement he was never killed by any white supremacists klan members  As soon as he was starting the  poor people s campaign for economic justice boom dead   On top of that it is now well known that at the time the government was busy infiltrating leftist political movements with agents intending to collapse them and generally treating left leaning political organizations protesters like  ambiguous label for people it s okay to mistreat kill  terrorists now communists at the time  
PoliticalDiscussion,I know its free speech I said that earlier I am just pointing out the double standards I know the audience was different but I don t remember it getting anywhere as much news coverage as Rush Also I dislike both of there beliefs They were stupid and said stupid stuff  Also Bill Maher never apologized while Rush did 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well in all honesty I thought that in the midst of a major recession taking on Healthcare reform was poorly timed  Plus it shifted a lot of extra costs on Middle Class families and made their situations a lot worse  I know since the  reform happened my costs have increased quite a bit  So while it did help out of work college kids and those with pre existing conditions it did hurt people who were already over burdened  One of the big things healthcare reform was supposed to accomplish was to control costs   and it didn t do that for the average family As for GM   How far are the taxpayers in the hole for that one  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Volcker Rule hasn t been dropped  Most of the rest of your complaints are that Obama has to operate in a corrupt system with a Congress that can be bought Not sure what exactly he can do about that Obama cannot dictate something  it s got to pass Congress And to pass Congress it s got to get enough votes And lobbyists can legally say  We don t like gov t negotiating drug rates Displease us and you will not get our future financial support for your re election campaigns   Am I disappointed that the ACA is not as good as it could have been That there s no public option Absolutely In some cases due to my stance to the left of the President I wish he had beat on centrist Dems to show some spine on this and reap the rewards later at the ballot box But I recognize that you can t simply wish away the realities of our political system no matter how toxic those realities are  I have complaints about Obama sure But the idea that he s  done nothing is flat wrong and IMO he s  clearly a better alternative than all the GOP candidates

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m an American that sees things objectively  I would posit that if you see no functional difference between the Gulf War and NATO intervention in Libya  or the one in Bosnia  then you aren t nearly as objective as you think you are  For starters we provided some air support to a NATO operation in Libya We were not leading the effort nor did we spend the largest sum of money of the participating nations Contrast that with GWI where it was  not a NATO or UN mission with American leadership at the top it was an American effort with various other countries acting in ancillary subordinate roles The scope was dramatically different too  I don t like using the phrase  anti American for someone willing to criticize the State Department  or any other functional unit of the government  as I think all citizens should turn a skeptical eye towards government We are after all  the boss

PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t Kissinger win his Peace Prize many years down the line  Obama got his   for what  Appearing on Al Jazeera as his first televised broadcast  I never understood why the Nobel Prize people gave it to him he didn t accomplish anything yet as he just became President a month or two before 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ugh what a joke  From what I ve read this actually hurt poor people by eliminating cheaper used cars for them to buy  Nonetheless my family took advantage of it though even though we didn t really need it   and bought foreign

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Free markets inherently have these protections built into them it doesn t need a rd party trying to fix it  I suppose you re talking about consumers factoring in those preferences in their choice of where to spend their money  But that assumes that the cost associated with that process is minimal  Let s say a consumer would prefer  dollar free range beef cheeseburger over a  factory farmed beef cheeseburger  But if collecting the necessary information and finding and travelling to an appropriate producer would cost   they will instead make the sub optimal  choice  Even a system in which private rating agencies provide such information would face a number of limitations that would prevent it from facilitating an efficient implementation of the consumer utility function  And this is really the reason we started implementing laws and regulations in the first place  Some producer behaviors that have extremely high consumer utility value are nevertheless very resistant to the standard profit incentive due to market inefficiencies  Even a court system runs into limitations that are inherent to a system that tries to resolve grievances after the fact  For an extreme example take global warming  Assume for a moment that what climate scientists say is correct  that developed nations are dumping greenhouse gases into the air which will cause massive problems for developing nations in  years   How would the free market or a system of courts rectify that  Are developing nations going to go to an international court system  years from now and receive compensation for damages inflicted upon them by people who have long since died  And what possible deterrence effect could that have  That s why certain behaviors with high costs to society have to be prevented from ever happening in the first place  And the only institution capable to doing that is government

PoliticalDiscussion, gt First off  you took my second quote out of context which I don t appreciate You ll notice I gave an example immediately following the Civil Rights Act  which you don t think is a good thing  of what I perceive to be overreach  I guess the point I m trying to make is through the use of the Commerce Clause the gov t has vastly overstepped it s bounds in ways that it shouldn t have  Just because it  may have done one good thing with the Civil Rights Act doesn t mean it s worth all the bad that came with that     gt Second businesses operate within the society that we  the citizens and the Constitution lays out Without society and law no business would be able to operate no matter how  private they declare themselves to be  I disagree  While the gov t may regulate businesses in the sense of taxation and safety forcing them to do business with people they don t want to do business is grossly overstepping their power  A business is a private entity that consists of private property  The Gov t using the commerce clause to inject itself there is just wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,That juror would probably wouldn t be selected if they think that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If you re interested in Con Law I d imagine MIT might post a course but in short the Executive Branch has broad discretion in forming foreign policy  intelligence trade policy State Dep t etc   The President couldn t withdraw the country from the UN without Congress for example but could diminish America s role and frustrate the efforts of others He could enact trade regulation as protectionist as GATT will allow He could withdraw trade officials and embassy officials in addition to troops and intelligence officials from anywhere in the world  He could do all that by why would he  Like I said from what I ve heard there is a big difference between pulling out our embassy personnel and pulling troops out of countries where we shouldn t be in anymore  At least that s what I always thought RP s position to be in regards to foreign intervention stop being the world s policeman   gt As for the latter half of your comment I assume once R TX  is no longer in the public eye and subject to criticism that the defense will stop I don t care who the subject is though going to someone s defense as a reflex is lunacy One ends up defending acts or positions that are indefensible  The problem is that it seems both political parties seemed to have it out for the guy hence the siege mentality among the supporters  These are people who really believe in the Libertarian viewpoints and are tired of the  politics as usual   In their minds if not Ron Paul s views then proceed on the current path that had given us so much good and also so much bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see it as a gradual improvement that has been continuing for thousands of years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Health care reform Bank Fiance Reform    Or for the friends of yours  like some of mine that only respond to Bumper Sticker Statements    Osama Bin Laden is Dead and GM is Alive   Well  
PoliticalDiscussion,Decision making by the people is decision making by the people Democracy gives those decisions the authority of government 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It makes voting for anyone other than a Republican a purely symbolic act  I m curious why you think voting Republican wouldn t be a purely symbolic act as well They re going to win anyway right 
PoliticalDiscussion, lt 
PoliticalDiscussion,He may have contradicted himself but he is not a troll Im so fucking tired of the knee jerk troll accusation Its like calling someone a nazi You feign incredulity over something that was not THAT controversial then claim the only explanation is that they must be intentionally fucking with you when that isnt clear AT ALL and then pretend that there is nothing to be gained from the discussion and shut them out Youre a fucking cunt if you do that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your vote for president wouldn t  count more in a popular vote You re ineffectual regardless The way you view the Maryland vote now would just be the way you view the national vote in the future  EDIT I love how anyone who says this is automatically downvoted despite the fact that there s exactly nothing you can say to challenge the idea that your vote doesn t have causal effect No counter argument exists Not one If you personally had any say in whether the president got re elected he d be on the phone with you more often 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey if you can t make an argument yourself I guess you could always appeal to authority 
PoliticalDiscussion,War is messy We are there because they could not control their own government who fucked with the wrong people Either they organize their own modern system themselves or we do it for them If you choose the former you have to be willing to die for your cause If you choose the latter then occassionally one of our soldiers is going to snap and murder civilians  Harsh I know but the truth We bombed civilians in Germany and Japan too and if you dont understand why youre naive   People have some responsibility for who they allow to govern them   
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox News Claims Hitler was an Atheist 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s true but we had quite a bit fewer people then and people were willing to pay for their programs  as evidenced by the much higher tax rates especially for the wealthy  
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you think voting is a  good thing to do  If so why 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess I need a new record book  Mine still says Henry Kissinger 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not as if those goals are at all mutually exclusive
PoliticalDiscussion,his name s you mad i feel like he wants to be inflammatory 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul s current policy proposals are based off trying to cut as much as possible from our currently enormous federal government however the libertarian movement he currently represents in mainstream politics was around in the  s and definitely didn t approve of most of Ike s policies I point this out because your comment implies tea party voters should see Ike as favoring small government however he expanded the role of government during his presidency and would likely do so were he president today 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have never understood this attitude A sitting President is the Commander in Chief of the armed forces He decides what course of action to take in regards to military action During the weeks prior to the Osama bin Laden raid President Obama was heavily involved in deciding what form the attack would take and it was his decision not to include Pakistan in the planning And as Commander in Chief it was still his order that caused the operation to be conducted just as President Bush s order was what caused us to invade Iraq  You can choose whom to assign credit for but to actively ignore the role that someone plays just because you don t like their politics is petty shallow and frankly not very intelligent 
PoliticalDiscussion,While every program he lists is as ineffectual as it is immoral I agree that it s easiest to see why farm laws are bad arguably tied with social security 
PoliticalDiscussion,As someone who has been to several tea parties  although my politics are significantly to the right of the average person at those I m extremely critical of president Eisenhower and I imagine he would be of us He entangled us with Iran among other things for which we are still seeing consequences Of course as a minarchist there are very few US presidents about whom I m not extremely critical 
PoliticalDiscussion,most of the stuff on that website is true the problem is it s bragging about almost exclusively bad things he s done so far
PoliticalDiscussion,No most government services are not easily replaceable by private entities 
PoliticalDiscussion, Yes    is why I think in modern times it must be ironic 
PoliticalDiscussion,I personally beleive that politics and government are to big in most cases and am rather annoyed at the constant bickering witnessed during political arguments the point of politics in my opinion is to find an issue defend different sides of the issue and put it forwards to government to be sorted out Definition of politics poli many tics annoying parasites that populate animal fur hair Therefore politicians are a bunch of annoying parasites 
PoliticalDiscussion, When the safety or well being of others close to you is in danger and can only be prevented by that of deceit 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s set a world record for most violence authorized by a recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize and become the first President to authorize the assassination of an American citizen without due process   braces for downvotes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well with a username like his   I d go with yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,He ran as a Libertarian in  and then as a Republican in   The reason why he doesn t run as an Independent is because third Party candidates in general are basically shunned in national politics and campaigns Even for better known candidates like Ralph Nader they really struggle to gain any kind of coverage from the Mainstream Media Paul stated a few times that there s not enough Democracy in America to allow a third Party candidate any chance in the election  If he did run as an Independent he wouldn t be receiving any media attention at all The only reason he has gotten the coverage he has now is because he has the ability to participate in Republican debates 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree Europe is having lots of problems with them You could try and sound like less of an asshole next time Also make your post more for discussion instead of an inflammatory statement 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,  FOX NEWS CLAIMS EISENHOWER WAS A DEMOCRAT  
PoliticalDiscussion,  PEOPLE STILL SURPRISED TO FIND OUT OBAMA IS NOT A MUSLIM  
PoliticalDiscussion,When I said  we should rewrite the Constitution I meant more  the Constitution needs to be rewritten  I have no idea who would be doing the rewriting and it pretty much goes without saying that if the current crop of politicians were doing it we would end up with a mess 
PoliticalDiscussion,Those were Republicans I could respect    Yes with a capitol R 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is the real crux of the issue at play Most Democrats love to highlight the fact that Obama and the Democrats were held hostage by Republican obstructionists They forget the reality that Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate as well as the executive after Obama s election Were the Republicans obstructionists Sure of course they were that s how Republicans have acted for half a century Did the Democrats fail to fight for what they wanted in any meaningful way Yes I hear it time and time again Obama  had to sign the NDAA Obama  had to forget about a public option and government negotiated prices for pharmaceuticals Obama  couldn t close Guantanamo Bay and the list goes on I would be interested in knowing one instance where the Democrats actually fought for one of the major issues they ran on in  Don t have a super majority fine Make the Republicans fillibuster don t just give up even when the dems still hold a majority vote The Republicans would never act like this and that s why under G Bush II the Republicans got virtually everything they wanted even when they were the minority party 
PoliticalDiscussion,A wonderful idea Why not begin right now I call on MSNBC and huffington post and salon com to begin   With Obama   I m sure their rise in credibility would result in increased market share and force Fox to follow suit when we have a different president 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup and deporting them would destroy USa 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we  whoever that would be some sort of constitutional congress I would guess were to rewrite the constitution today I shudder to think of what we would come up with  Better the devil we know   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well Cheney tried to kill a man Got an apology out of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ditto your explanation and your conclusion I only add that to change this requires a constitutional amendment   So don t hold your breath 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s been one of the best compromisers and steadiest voices in the entire political dialogue for the past four years His agenda hasn t been completed but that s what re election is for If we were going to get every single thing a president ever had on his docket three years into his first term no one would ever run for re election  Oh and he s literally the only person in the entire political arena who doesn t want to start another big long expensive war Every Republican from here to Hades has been clambering to bomb Iran just as we got out of our last quagmire war They ll never learn 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dude are you fucking joking 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ford got a line of credit just in time  if it hadn t of happened they would have need assistance as well   Also both Honda and Toyota asked for assistance from the Japanese government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here you go  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Civil War was proof that you couldn t really get out of the Union if you wanted to not unless you were willing to sacrifice a huge number of lives and had superior firepower  which because of our standing peacetime armies controlled by the federal government is never going to happen  Agreed   gt We also passed the th Amendment which baked some anti federalist ideas into the Constitution itself and opened up the way for lots of federal governance  I think the th Amendment wouldn t be so anti federalist if certain Supreme Court rulings were overturned I can t tell you which ones right now I just remember thinking that in my Constitutional Law class    gt World War II was another one when Americans were all thrust together and a national identity was pushed as a way to help motivate the population and win the war  Is that necessarily a hindrance to federalism   gt Finally the advent of a large number of technologies made the world much smaller all Americans share the same internet the same television the same music the same movies etc Regional media specialties have been pushed to the fringe which means that the distinction between states has gotten much weaker than it once was  Very much agreed   gt I don t really have a preference one way or another about whether we operate as a federation or as a single nation what I do care about is that the base rules for how government is run actually work Under this current hybrid system with the rules laying out a federation and the government operating as a nation this is not the case so one thing or another should be changed   I have a preference toward federalism because I think trying to implement effective rules and implement them efficiently and fairly is generally more difficult at the national level At the national level the rules must be tailored to suit sometimes vastly different ways of life whereas at the state level the rules can be tailored more specifically toward certain groups    gt For the reasons outlined above I think it would probably be easier better for the Constitution to be rewritten  though of course in today s political climate that would be a disaster  That would be wonderful There are definitely areas of law that have not adapted well to new ways of life Looking at you criminal procedure and copyright Too bad people will just scream  Why do you hate  Murica   
PoliticalDiscussion,The mandate will most likely get struck down simply because it s unconstitutional Regardless of intentions or actual benefits an unconstitutional law is still unconstitutional This will deal a huge blow to people s perception of his credibility and competence as a constitutional law professor This could very likely lose him a second term Single payer was the way to go constitutionally speaking but he didn t want the label of having destroyed the health insurance industry especially with the economic and jobs situation at the time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the last third party candidate to win a presidential election was Abraham Lincoln 
PoliticalDiscussion,Listening to the far left isn t any better than listening to the far right  A huge majority of what the left will say Obama achieved is as much bullshit as the horrors the far right has said he s done  Unless you can get a reasonable person on the right to admit that Obama s actually achieved something it s probably not true The same goes for any political figure really and the adverse goes for criticisms   An example of a real success of his is Medical business He had a genuinely necessary and good plan even if it hasn t worked out by some counts I think his effort and vision here is extraordinary  For things he hasn t done I tend to take the example of the Iraq war which he  ended by bailing out only months before the scheduled withdrawal This wasn t an achievement he can really claim because of this  Basically I just think that going to the far left to escape the far right is as stupid as it is hypocritical Don t try to cancel out what you ve heard by going the other way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure if trolling   
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right that self defense is an affirmative defense under normal circumstances but I m pretty sure  precedent has been set in Florida   that this is not the case   gt Once a defendant makes a prima facie showing of self defense the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense The burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt including the burden of proving that a defendant did not act in self defense never shifts from the State   Here   and  here   are two more cases where this was established Of course I am not a lawyer so maybe I m reading those wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives in the democrat controlled congress were definitely flipping their shot over moral hazard but when they passed it despite the opposition Bush signed it which I give him credit for Given that we are talking about presidents current and through implication future I assumed when you we referring to conservatives you meant bush not congress I was just doing a bad job of agreeing   
PoliticalDiscussion,Eisenhower presided over a government that spent a  tiny fraction   of what the government currently spends on social welfare  If you called for a return to s policies you would make Ron Paul look like a moderate 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry to comment on three of your posts with in the span of  minutes but you made several interesting points and I wanted to adress each individually   My understanding of our government as it was intended is that it was set up this way to ensure that the will of the people is carried out by those who know what is in the best interest of those people Give the masses the power to do anything but fuck themselves Give them a voice not the definitive voice but enough of a voice to decide who gets the definite voice The idea was a compromise The government would usually be by the people but always for the people When the people didn t know what was in their own best interests the people they elected would know better When they had the right idea the people they elected would carry out that idea The problem is that we have career politicians elected by uninformed voters and who are in bed with special interests Too often we don t know what s in our best interest and so we elect people who either also don t know of just straight up don t care   Whenever something goes wrong in a representative democracy it s either because A The government is doing what the people elected it to do when the people didn t elect it to do the right things Or B officials aren t doing what they were elected to do even though they were elected to do the right things It s a cluster and I haven t explained it very well but hopefully people will get the picture 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cut taxes raised spending single handedly beat the Soviets armed Sadam with chemical weapons to use on Iranians Sold weapons to Iran to fund wars in nicaragua  secretly helped the taliban and al qaeda become the best trained terrorists in the world raised taxes ate jellybeans  What s not to like  I should probably source all that stuff but it s late and I m tired 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m an Obama supporter I don t consider myself a Democrat as much as an anti republican  Even I know that you can t label all Republicans based on one idiot who made a sticker and a couple of racists who buy it  On BOTH sides there are extremists bastards racists idiots etc  You can t define a party by it s worst members both sides will end up looking bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,So  People voted for Bush  That doesn t mean that  his wars were justified 
PoliticalDiscussion,The traditional concept of a declaration of war has been deemed to be more or less inadequate when dealing with terrorism With traditional war you had clearly defined sides and militaries But now you have a group  of a half dozen people living in a country planning on their own to act as a cell to attack the United States These people ignore borders rules of war and are extremely difficult to locate  The traditional attitude towards combat is outdated and it doesn t suffice We can t  declare war on a group of four people that the CIA learns about I m not saying I condone the actions of our leadership but I do firmly believe that drones and special strikes are the combat of the st century 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dunno about that  My healthcare costs were going up at a steady rate but after they passed the bill they really jumped up a lot and are still going up  
PoliticalDiscussion,WTF Just shut the fuck up Slavery was over  years ago no one alive today went through the tourtures and alienation of American slavery so calling someone a  nigger does not have the same effect like it did  years ago the N word is just like any other word Stop being so dramatical and grow a pair  First things first you need to understand people You don t seem to understand how life works  Everyone is equal everyone is born with the same natural rights as anyone else As you grow up you begin to change You adopt different thoughts than others different habits different beliefs As more time passes these differences sticks with you and it makes you who you are as an individual Your experience in life makes you the person you are today and till the end of your existence So there is a pattern We go from all being born the same to all dying different from one another Get it good let s move on  Now you talk about people being racist and how its a problem that should be addressed Let s start from the stop Who is racist is it white people black people Yellow people Red people purple people Could be anyone right So color of skin doesn t break it down lets cross that off  Maybe its where your from There are a lot of Southerners who say racist things maybe thats the problem  But there are a lot of them in the north too  and the west   and In China Shit chinese people are racist against other chinese people So it can t be where your from let s cross that off too   Let me cut to the chase Racism comes from experience When one has an experience whether good or bad it becomes generalized in the mind For example If i ate chinese food for the first time and I get sick Im associating chinese food with sickness So when someone asks me  Hey do you like chinese food  I would reply  no thats disgusting ew chinese food makes me sick   Another example When a black woman goes in for a job and the white manager tells her  Sorry we are not hiring at the moment She could be walking out thinking  fuck white people   If a white guy orders food at a restaurant and the black waiter brings the wrong dish He could be thinking  Damn this black guy is stupid  These are all extreme cases where one immediately goes to some sort of racist thought keep in mind the less educated you are the more likely these senario s are to occur  But in all serousness The real culprit of racism is not experience but lack of experience Majority of people you call racist have little to no experience with people their racist against The reason they have those thoughts is because of the people around them and the the things that make them who they are Lets take the stereotypical southern white male Grows up on a ranch goes to an all white school believes in the teachings of Jesus This guy hardly ever encounters a black man yet he s considered racist What could be influencing him Lets say this guy turns on the Tv and sees a rap video There are these guys earing huge gold chains large white tees baggy jeans below the waist talking about doings drugs and fucking bitches undoubtedly hes shocked He can t believe people can act like that it s so out the norm out of his comfort zone Later that week hes walking down the street and sees two black men wearing huge white tees and baggy jeans below their waist He would obviously feel uncomfortable from what he s seen on tv these guys must be associated with drugs and other sinful things As time goes on his opinion starts to solidify In his mind black people means feeling uncomfortable and no one likes feeling uncomfortable  Now we see peoples lack of experience makes them  racist What can we do to solve this Educate interaction positive imaging Educate is easy you just have to change whats taught in schools Interaction is rising since this country is the melting pot of the world we got people of all races and colors shapes genders sexual orientation As time goes one interaction between people is sure to increase   Now by what your saying I get the impression your relitively young You haven t been around much don t have much experience outside your comfort zone Most of your knowledge comes from highschool and various videos on the internet That s okay you still got a lot of time to live and learn outside the box 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There needs to be      an admission of the need for change in order to get past race being an issue  This is what I was arguing for Calling out the people over  don t re nig stickers and calling for change can be the first step just like you said   I regret giving off the implication that all republicans are racists  what I meant was that you can t just write it off as a few bad apples and not talk about it especially when said bad apples are aligning themselves with your cause   Republican leaders are in a position to create positive change and are yet to properly capitalize on this I think they should 
PoliticalDiscussion,Considering the government had a   failure rate in habeas corpus hearings for Gitmo detainees    meaning  of the people were released by order of a because there was not enough evidence to even hold them let alone try them  it s a pretty safe bet that not only are most of these people not terrorist leaders most of them are not even terrorists   The real answer to your question because the government says so  The other real answer to your question the legal memorandum allowing Awlaki  and US citizens in particular to be killed is still secret so the is unanswerable to anyone without a Top Secret clerance I am not sure if a legal memorandum to assassinate non US citizens has been released 
PoliticalDiscussion,And without the reforms they d be even higher  
PoliticalDiscussion,You asked for one   lol
PoliticalDiscussion,A little bit based on the  stake they had in Mazda at the time  But Mazda makes money off of Ford as well through the sale of parts and components  I would say that s a bit of a wash between the two companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m thinking of starting a thread asking for a little heavier moderation on obvious flame posts Is that something most of the community would go for 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a ridiculous assumption English is too deeply rooted in America it would be impossible to make a language switch on that big of a scale People will know English and Spanish but never replace one with the other 
PoliticalDiscussion,The things I hate about Obama are things that he s actually done  Like broker record arms sales launch wars without congressional approval assassinate US citizens and curtail civil liberties including the freedom of the press  I think those are legitimate reasons not to like a dude  Please stop making dumb generalizations about the opposition 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but it s much easier and much more fun to police other groups than it is to police your own Expecting an entire party to react to one guy selling racist bumper stickers is unrealistic  EDIT And normally I m all for beating the crap out of the GOP over hypocrisy but in this case it s just silly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh for fuck s sake 
PoliticalDiscussion,No some people hate Obama for a wild caricature  muslim black etc   most people hate him because he is a democrat Some actually hate him because they believe the policies he is following will lead to long term harm   Like most people hated bush for what he did but some people hated him for his  being a republican Also among the valid reasons of hate to bush was so surrounded in conspiracy theories that blew my mind  I find very little difference between the idiots who hate Obama for being an  other and the conspiracy theorists who hated Bush because he was part of the NWO or because he orchestrated    Are the right better at vocalizing their hate than the left sure but that is not the point People always hate the people on the other side    
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with SperminCain  We need to raise the level of discourse around here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Rand Paul 
PoliticalDiscussion,Duly noted  I didn t notice the up down voting ratio on this post when I made this comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good point  English is the most international language the world has ever seen  I don t see it going away any time soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please don t associate all of  r politicaldiscussion  r politicaldiscussion with one of reddit He s extremist and he posts this kind of shit all of the time I ve written the mods about him but got no response We re not all like him and he gives liberals a shitty name In fact I m still not convinced that he isn t trolling 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Health Care Reforms saved money  For who  My costs are way up following the  reform    
PoliticalDiscussion,I did that already in the above post please re read 
PoliticalDiscussion,Much worse things were done against Bush There were people burning him in effigy and threatening his daughters lives  The media never reports it because he s one of those stuffy ol republicans and he can take care of himself  However if you maintain the democratic sentiment that blacks are a totally separate group of people and need special protection  because they re so weak they can t handle themselves then yes we should be jumping to make sure nobody hurts the presidents feelings like this again 
PoliticalDiscussion,I should rephrase I think it is that but I don t think it s just that The fact that party politics change over time is not in and of itself noteworthy This isn t r history it s r politicaldiscussion OP necessarily means to say something else by it   He s making an argument of ideological inconsistency one couldn t accuse the Democratic Party of the same thing  unless you went way further back  It s a common form of argument for those on the left Note for example that  of the Daily Show consists not of attacking the merits of ideas but of point out hypocrisy   inconsistency of beliefs and actions  That s reflected in the way everyman Democrats make their arguments 
PoliticalDiscussion,People hated Bush for things he was actually doing   People hate Obama for a wild caricature of things that  the right says that he might do in the future  These seem different to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Name one sitting elected Republican other than Ron Paul who has voiced opposition to interference in Iran 
PoliticalDiscussion, The tolerant liberal suddenly becomes very intolerant when their official religion is challenged   Ann Coulter
PoliticalDiscussion,Healthcare needed fixing He tried to fix it I don t agree with how he did it or how it s worked but he did the right thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well he s at least asking what Eisenhower and today s political right  specifically the tea party would think of eachother The statement sort of implies they would be at odds with eachother but obviously not everyone drew that conclusion 
PoliticalDiscussion,life is still the most beautiful and precious thing to a human being without life there can be no other  freedom is like a very nice and addictive bonus like crack 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please stop with this utter rubbish While the marginal tax rates were higher the effective rates were much lower Bring back the deductions and you can make the tax rates whatever your little socialist heart desires 
PoliticalDiscussion, Sobre mi cad ver  as it were English is too widely known worldwide to ever fade in favor of Spanish even as the Hispanic population of North America continues to rise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just because they don t have a shot in winning the primary doesn t mean the entire political spectrum is devoid of them  There are plenty in Congress who feel the same way about Iran as you do in terms of avoiding another costly and useless war  I m just saying don t paint Obama as some sole voice of reason when it comes to Iran  There are plenty who believe similarly to he does 
PoliticalDiscussion,I dunno that s all just wishy washy  The Nobel prize committee broke decades of tradition when they awarded Obama   they played favorites instead of weighing the actual merits of the award  It was dumb and made them look bad  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And you re trying to turn one woman into a scapegoat for what is a serious issue regarding racism among the republican constituency  Just because most racists are Republicans doesn t mean most Republicans are racists But I agree that it s sad to see that not only did someone make this that people actually bought it and put it on their car   gt Perhaps it might be if white people were not the majority in American politics and there was a history of hundreds of years of oppression of whites of them getting fire hoses set on them when protesting for basic human rights of being owned whipped and raped of only counting as   of a fucking human But it isn t whites were the oppressors  Honkey pales in comparison to  nigger    I completely understand and I myself ascribe to Critical Race Theory but you also have to understand that racism is racism There aren t degrees of racism there s just racism And it goes both ways whites racist towards blacks blacks racist towards whites And you re right it needs to be addressed but I don t think politicians talking about race will do any good Political diatribes about racism wouldn t accomplish anything it might even hurt race relations There needs to be systemic change and an admission of the need for change in order to get past race being an issue 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it s either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Distant fucking cousins Some are th cousins multiple times removed Some more than that Humans are all related to each other if you go back enough This is NOT the basis for a conspiracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,The post wasn t  here s an eisenhower quote isn t it super true  He was pointing out a position Eisenhower held that would alienate him from today s right wingers 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt when you don t have to apologize for atrocities  Or you can be apolitical not vote etc and also not have to apologize for atrocities I mean if a Libertarian can wash his hands of what America does as a collective simply because they re not Repub Dem then certainly people who don t even vote are also free from sin 
PoliticalDiscussion,Link I d like to see how something so ridiculous could be enforced 
PoliticalDiscussion,Executive orders are not laws merely the instructions from the president to the executive branch  By definition the president can t violate them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That doesn t mean they are all impossible however  The lack of evidence doesn t make them impossible people s inability to keep secrets does There is no dark cabal that controls everything 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree but he expanded it from what was in many ways a much smaller base particularly with regard to entitlements  Returning to those levels is more even than Ron Paul talks about at least in some areas 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He may have contradicted himself but he is not a troll   I disagree It is humanly impossible for someone to hold that much cognitive dissonance   gt Its like calling someone a nazi  No it isn t Only a fucking cunt would compare the word  troll to a nazi 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is your head buried in the sand or someone elses ass 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s ridiculous to say Tom Hanks supported the activity in ANY WAY   If Tom Hanks put down his microphone and left   Said something like  I don t want any part of this   call me when you are done  and then went and got a drink or something    then I would agree with you Hemming and hawing and laughing it off is both cowardly  and disgusting in my book 
PoliticalDiscussion,Taxes weren t higher  Rates were higher but there were large exemptions  Taxes as  of GDP have been a rock solid  of GDP since ww regardless of nominal rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see what you did there   Where did I ever assert people on the left did not attack bush The distinction I was making was Fox machine refused to allow any light of day hit it s viewership s eyes that ANYONE could talk bad about Bush It was tantamount to wanting America to fail Treason and subject of disgust ridicule  Throw the libs in Gitmo kinda attitude   No one is pushing them out of the debate or calling them traitors  Shit The President s Birth Certificate is still up to debate on the right   how far we have come 
PoliticalDiscussion,Schemes to deliver equal results have failed and resulted in hundreds of millions of people suffering and dying While your thought experiment is a nice idea we know that in practice that it is a horror   The best that we can hope to do is to offer equal opportunity If a place can give a person that lands there with no money the opportunity to gain great wealth in their lifetime then that has proven to be the best system we have been able to put into practice 
PoliticalDiscussion,Plenty of people spoke out about Bush and how much they disliked him when he was President If you don t understand something don t assume You ll make an ass out of yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,People seem to be missing the point he made once and isn t bringing back up The GOP calls on Muslims to call out their extremists as such Mainstream GOP members aren t doing it for their own party   And there s a huge difference between attacking Bush for his intelligence and Obama for his race 
PoliticalDiscussion,Focusing on the few wingnuts in the room is a distraction for everybody    I thought  r politicaldiscussion was above this kind of stuff

PoliticalDiscussion,They are not making a deal The original versions of the Food Modern safety act outlawed backyard gardening and seed banking Those bills did not pass but the one that did gives the FDA the teeth to take away your gardening through regulation You can grow the food but it will be against the law for you to eat it save it sell it give it away or transport it out of the garden It s for your safety and mine I am so sorry  I did not realize that your nightmare was so close at hand when I asked the question 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re painting with too broad a brush  And you re trying to turn one woman into a scapegoat for what is a serious issue regarding racism among the republican constituency I do not want for this issue to glide by because it is the work of a  bad apple  The fact remains that there was a market People  bought them means that there is a community of racists aligning themselves with the party That s not cool   gt If a left leaning person made a bumper sticker that said  Don t vote Romney  the great white honkey and some left leaning people bought it the Democrats would have to apologize  I m sorry but this is not an appropriate comparison Perhaps it might be  if white people were not the majority in American politics and there was a history of hundreds of years of oppression of whites of them getting fire hoses set on them when protesting for basic human rights of being owned whipped and raped of only counting as   of a fucking human But it isn t whites were the oppressors  Honkey pales in comparison to  nigger    Now if in an alternate universe a black Republican president was up for re election and people started putting up  don t renig bumper stickers then YES I would be wanting  something done about it if only it being the Democratic party calling people out on it and apologizing Something must be done to show that this is NOT OKAY  It seems to me that in America we think we ve somehow  fixed racism and we don t want to talk about the elephant in the room It s still here it s still an issue It needs to be talked about and recognized in politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,I tend to agree with your first statement   Given incentive for and shreds of evidence pointing to a conspiracy some people will always try to believe that everything is normal   It s easier to believe that we have knowledge of everything that goes on in the world than to believe that we are being kept ignorant 
PoliticalDiscussion,Explain to me these  things   What is your different definition of freedom   How does an individual isolated from using the power of government hinder your freedom   How does a business interest isolated from using the power of government hinder your freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion,How s the kool aid Deluxepineapple is right you are as biased and knee jerky as the Republicans you assail 
PoliticalDiscussion,I never said I supported their decision I merely pointed out what I think was the logic behind it Yes it is flawed Yes it was politically motivated However I think can understand what they were thinking At the beginning of his term Obama had a lot of potential and this was a way to try and divert some of that towards preventing wars  The Peace Prize is given because Alfred Nobel felt guilty that his great invention  dynamite was used to kill people He intended it as a tool for miners The prize given to Obama may not have followed the letter of this prize but it certainly followed the spirit  This was a group of idealists giving a prize or an incentive or a bribe whatever you want to call it  to someone they thought can work for their benefits  case in point world peace  I have difficulty differentiating this from normal political lobbying Again whether it is suitable for the Nobel Peace Prize committee to engage in this kind of behavior is questionable On the other hand they have some degree of influence in the world and the late Mr Nobel would probably agree that the prize bearing his name is used to promote world peace This is not to say they succeeded in giving the prize to Obama but they definitely thought if had a chance 
PoliticalDiscussion,If oxygen water food shelter etc matter more than freedom that implies that you would abandon freedom if that was the only way to gain those things I would not Life as a slave in trade for the basic necessities is not a life worth living 
PoliticalDiscussion,ObamaCare is unpopular among independents as well as Republicans  It is a huge negative for Obama and the Dems at the voting booths  Dragging this issue back to the forefront of political discussion can only hurt Obama no matter which direction the ruling goes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Na I have many conservative views just sick of the National Enquirer that is Fox and GOP talking points The conservative brand has been hijacked by insane radicals that has no equivalence on the left no balance at all They run the show  We need real conservative men with integrity to take back the reigns or we are going over the cliff Mark my words Romney if elected will increase the debt and Fox will make apologies for it Just like after   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Let s keep the argument to this century  The point is that one person  or even part of a group doesn t automatically stain the rest of the group with their wackiness Temporal closeness is totally irrelevant    gt Guess you guys like wasting  troops and over  Trillion in debt to give Iran more control over the region but lose your shit if Obama spends  Million keeps his hands clean and topples a dictator  Reagan classified as a terrorist all while not hurting any US service men Not to mention letting the people in the country do by their own hands  Still stuck in the dichotomy eh Join us on the libertarian side It s so much easier to sleep when you don t have to apologize for atrocities 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you are saying your guy is better than their guy so they should not be mean to your guy  
PoliticalDiscussion,Plenty of mainstream Republicans speak out against the far right on a regular basis 
PoliticalDiscussion,Freedom does not mean a license to violate another s rights Freedom is the right to choose your own actions that do no harm to others How is a license to be a tyrant asshole implied in the word freedom Murder and child abuse is not freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion,and for good reason OBama is not half of what Fox makes him out to be while Bush did some terrible shit Invading a nation in a war of choice based on lies sending our troops without body armor Outting a CIA agent working on Iran WMD domestic wire tapping     Real damage to our nation but the right had no issue with most of that Obama can t hold a candle to Bush Cheney crime machine most of the shit about Obama is just straight up BS 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you might just be more biased than the folks you re talking about 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt GOP and Dem  Which GOP ones Certainly not any of the presidential candidates that have a shot in hell of winning the primary 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot actually Many people like Sean Hanity get threats continually GOP and Tea party people are not the same and neither of them want him assassinated with the exception of a few radicals which exist on both sides Some radical leftists wanted Bush dead too The thing about free speech is it is entitled to you as well as people you don t agree with that is what makes it great 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m aware  Perhaps you should try reminding the people in this thread using his drawdown from his surge to boost his anti war credibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tell that to the animals   How can I be sure my death is worthwhile and causes freedom if I m dead How can I be sure that the world is not an illusion until after that 
PoliticalDiscussion,If a left leaning person made a bumper sticker that said  Don t vote Romney  the great white honkey and some left leaning people bought it the Democrats would have to apologize You re painting with too broad a brush The person who made this and the people who bought them are obviously racist but to blame an entire political party over this is just non sensical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah fox news is a republican channel everyone knows that Politics is toxic in this country and everyone knows that  There were countless other people who said worse about bush publically the problem was that dixie chicks did it in London and they were a  country band It was not like you were not allowed to publically oppose bush millions and millions did including me The rhetoric against bush was not as awful as rhetoric against obama but it was very very evident and everywhere  
PoliticalDiscussion,But it s not really Many despots claim enlightenment of some sort 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s keep the argument to this century   Republicans claim Iraq was just and now champion it as a success  see Rove on Fox news but complain about Libya which was mountains of a success more than Iraq debacle    Guess you guys like wasting  troops and over  Trillion in debt to give Iran more control over the region but lose your shit if Obama spends  Million keeps his hands clean and topples  a dictator  Reagan classified as a terrorist all while not hurting any US service men Not to mention letting the people in the country do by their own hands    Obama didn t go on a  year campagin to invade whie his buddies made out in tens of Billions in no bid contracts   Yeah Bush Cheney were heros and Obama is a monster 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt when a black guy from an underprivileged background beats the wife of an ex president and the son of an admiral  What if I told you that  underprivileged black man was actually the son of a Kenyan government official and an anthropologist with relations to  previous presidents  Downvote the uncomfortable truth Obama s related to the Bushs AND Cheney His Kenyan family is powerful as well  Here s the wiki entry no bias d infowars bullshit  
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats claim they aren t racist yet FDR interned the Japanese Contradictions much Dems  s 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you were paying attention during the campaign you would realize Obama wanted to continue fighting the war in Afghanistan 
PoliticalDiscussion,      gt Dixie chicks were in trouble because their fan base were fans of bush   See the difference is then you were labeled a Traitor by the Fox news machine if you opposed Bush in any way Today if you don t want Obama assassinated you are not a GOP Tea Party member   The Dixie chicks have a right to their views without death threats How many death threats does Fox and crew get for spewing shit about Obama Or Ted Nugent for saying he wants to shoot Obama 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think elites have incentive to keep their activities hidden  They can have far more impact through established channels Think tanks industry lobbies political action committees etc All these regulated channels are far more effective than  secret societies  for modern democracies at least   After the breakup of the Soviet Union you have a scenario which almost fits what OP described Russian elites conspired to hand over former state enterprises to well connected private citizens with a quid pro quo understanding The difference is that this activity was blatantly obvious to anyone with half a brain 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t know if I m just stating the obvious but the Nobel prize was never about what he had done It was all about what he should do Obama s prize was given to him to state support of the ending of US involvement in Iran and Afganistan It was not a reward but an incentive  That s silly  It s a  prize   You win it for accomplishing something not planning to accomplish something  Do I get one for saying I m gonna invent free electricity   gt The people who decide who gets the Peace Prize are fairly smart They wanted  idealistically that by giving it to someone not yet worth it he would become worth it as a result Whether this has actually happened is very debatable  The logic is simply not there  And looks even dumber in hindsight  I would wager that our relations with the Islamic world haven t improved all that much in the last  years and may have gotten worse    gt This is not a statement of facts nor do I claim to know something others don t It is just a way for me to explain the logic behind this prize In the end which is better Rewarding someone who has ended wars in the past or giving someone reason to prevent them in the future  Umm ending wars in the past  By your logic teachers should give all students an A before they take their first exam because it will make them want to get A s  It s recursive and illogical How do you not see how silly of a decision it was of the Nobel committee to give a man a prize for accomplishing  nothing  at the time  when there were real people who did real things to improve peace in the world that actually deserved it  The decision was purely political and not based in any rhyme or reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,How dose cutting costs hurt an economic recovery Health Care Reforms saved money  
PoliticalDiscussion,Different times different governments  Back then the Federal Gov t was a fraction of the size it is today and had a fraction of the responsibilities  
PoliticalDiscussion,What people also forget is that in Bush v Gore the House of Representatives could have awarded the electoral votes as well  Seeing as in  it was a Red House the outcome would ve been the same  It s weird how Democrats just won t let this go   it was a rare occurrence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the Koch brothers like to support some out there causes The thing is everyone knows it The information is completely available to those who choose to look it up  They may have the ear of some like minded politicians  Scott Walker but you can t call that a conspiracy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Or Texas  Those states don t bother me too much in Presidential Elections because they re pretty set  I can reasonably predict that NY and CA will go Blue  Texas will go Red  In fact it s what makes politicking so planned   you go for the swing states because the others are in the bag  There is a whole science to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,And forgetful of their history   
PoliticalDiscussion,Because stupid  That s why 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then why even bother having those states  If you make a change like that you might as well give them a choice to stay or leave the United States  If I were Kentucky or any flyover state I d tell the coasts to go fuck themselves and walk away    
PoliticalDiscussion,     The design seems to have originated from a site called Stumpy s Stickers which has since been dismantled The site featured similar stickers for sale including a picture of an ape that reads  Obama   a drawing of the Confederate flag with the message  If this flag has offended you then it made my day   and another that features members of the Ku Klux Klan and reads  The Original Boys In The Hood   
PoliticalDiscussion,Source for don t renig being a bestseller  Are there racists republicans sure but majority of them are not  As for the bush years you had enough on the left call him hitler dumb papa s boy  monkey and much much more It was not a big deal mostly because it was told by people whose fan base were liberal or non political Dixie chicks were in trouble because their fan base were fans of bush 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Bumper Sticker more specifically says  Don t re NIG in  implying the word Nigger I don t know of the OP s source that this is a  best seller as I ve just seen a picture or two of this bumper sticker on a car  I believe the Slate Political Gabefest summed up the  racism best There will always be crazies on each side of the asile who will go to the lowest common demoninator Republicans who accuse Clintons of rape or assassination Democrats who accuse Bush of plotting   to drive up oil prices It just happens to be that with Obama they have a new low to go to I honestly wouldn t be surprised if a majority of the people who hold signs showing Obama as a monkey or a muslim aren t actually racist but just so infuriated by him that they will insult him with whatever they can 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not a history buff and i m not in politics mostly networking  But when people like  bigbabyjesus make weak induction e g  poor black becomes president NO CONSPIRACIES EXIST  I tend to think the people who vehemently disagree with conspiracy theories are being just as irrational    Is there anyone competent that can comment on previous conspiracies  theories that actually turned out to be true  idk maybe watergate or something  A conspiracy turned true would just be a  scandal right  I d like to hear some substantial evidence in history  
PoliticalDiscussion,See  Southern Strategy   
PoliticalDiscussion,Socially to protect rights  Economically to provide things that the free market won t or can t provide effectively  Breaking up or regulating monopolies is one of the big ones that I think it should do more of  Either break up monopolies and let competition keep the fucking over customers down or take control and make rules to keep the fucking over customers down 
PoliticalDiscussion,  of all English words derive from French  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not saying I agree with the mandate But that was done to keep people from gaming the system  basically it keeps people from not buying insurance then finding out they have cancer and hurrying to buy it knowing they can t be denied thus making the insurance company pay for it even though they haven t been paying in  My point in bringing it up was that it was a huge gift to them You were saying they did it out of self preservation I was saying they re not worried by all accounts that s going to be a huge increase in income  It was their own lobbyists fighting so hard for it for this very reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,Given that English is the lingua franca of most of the world I don t see this happening However what I have noticed is Spanish words or little phrases making their way into everyday conversation between English speakers I could see how a few generations from now there will be more billingualism and even some Spanish that becomes absorbed into English   Question for any Brits out there is this how it is in your country with French I m not familiar with what the dynamic is there 
PoliticalDiscussion,First let me clarify that these aren t necessarily my own opinions but how  I believe the US government views it all but    As Malcolm points out the traditional declaration of war is long dead The last formal declaration of war was World War  But you don t need to be officially at war to act like you re at war and that s what the government is doing Furthermore congress has authorised the use of military force against terrorism targets So the President has legal authorisation to use the armed forces for the self defense of the United States and it s citizens And that s the key distinguishing point here it s the armed forces engaged in fighting terrorism The establishment is of the mindset that it s in a military conflict and that any attempting or supporting terrorism is militarily attacking the United States In the same way no one attempted to arrest German soldiers in world war  the government thinks the same about terrorists    The Third Geneva Convention covering the treatment of Prisoners of war helped to define the concept of an  Unlawful combatant  mostly by defining what to do with lawful ones The US Congress defined an unlawful combatant in the  Military Commissions Act of    It s probably easier to talk about who lawful combatants are The Iraqi Army were lawful combatants because they fought for a state in hostilities against the United States Militias Volunteer Corps or organised resistance are lawful combatants as long as they are under responsible command wear a distinctive sign visible from a distance carry their arms openly and abide by the laws of war So you can see The Taliban fail this test because they often don t wear distinctive signs or carry their arms openly or abide by the laws of war Al Queda as well So because they are engaged in hostilities against the United States they are unlawful combatants and lose many of the rights that lawful combatants would gain Alien Unlawful Combatants also legally lose their right to Habeas Corpus in the same way captured Germans or Japanese did in World War  because though they are unlawful they are still military combatants   So it doesn t necessarily mean you can define any hostile regime as unlawful combatants For example you can t use targeted killing against Iran or her soldiers  legally at least  because they have a sovereign State and generally play by the rules  in public at least  Their tanks are marked their soldiers carry their guns openly and generally follow the laws of war    Technically you cannot violate another nations sovereignty But countries also have a right to self defense So it s not a clear cut area Most targetted killings are done with the co operation of the country the person is hiding in But when we talk about this the main concern of the US is not the legality International law isn t really as strong or as clear or as well followed as domestic laws after all There is no international police or parliament that is going to find you guilty so it often comes down to international opinion Most western nations aren t going to allow you to kill people without getting pissed so it s legality is really moot So yeah they could send a SEAL team into Canada and shoot someone but why bother when Canadian Intelligence works so closely with the CIA They will just arrest them Even countries like Yemen and sometimes Pakistan provide permission that the US has asked for to do targeted killing Bin Ladens death is a good example of it happening without the countries permission though Most legal experts would probably consider it legal If Bin Laden is a military combatant against the United States and a Military leader the US has a right to self defense against him You can make an argument that if a sovereign nation refuses to help you or if you believe they might help him if you ask you have the right to do it yourself  But again with international law you just need to make sure you have a good excuse As you can see with the Bin Laden while Pakistan made a lot of noise about sovereignty no one really listened     So I mean you can see that legally these targeted killings have a pretty strong basis honestly both in domestic and international laws You can attack these killings from a legal standpoint but it s ultimately a futile exercise and only useful if you want to appeal to peoples emotions   There s a much stronger argument to be made that these killings are immoral and against the ideals of the United States or out of proportion or just cause too much collateral damage   Hopefully understanding the legal implications and the mindset of the government will help you understand why they happen Understanding this you can easily see why President Obama would do them When your advisors are all military and legal advisors the only thing you re going to hear is the military advantages and how it s legal to do so how it s an act of self defense to save Americans how dangerous these people are all the intelligence they have etc etc Not to say that excuses him just that the tone of the White House meetings and the intelligence he sees probably puts him in the mindset where authorising these acts is the best option 
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t seen the renig website and don t plan to I track a lot of politics but this thread is the first mention I ve seen of it Anyone who is making a big deal out of it is patently wrong  I defy you to find an elected Democrat espousing  truther bullshit Even on Reddit such things are looked at as silly   On the other hand you have  state legislatures passing  birther nonsense Sure   each side has their lunatics But the left has a lunatic fringe   the right s lunatics lead the movement   I didn t mean to paint Obama s critics with a broad bush but I can see how it could be read that way I just want to know why the Republican establishment continually focuses on untruths and distortions rather than discussing what people actually care about 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your right I got overwhelmed and didn t even finish what I started I m sorry about the insults 
PoliticalDiscussion,But they never did much of that to begin with  My health insurer is already a non profit     gt Then there s the mandate people have to get health insurance Even healthy young people Healthy young people don t tend to go to the doctor for things  That unconstitutional little bit won t last too long  
PoliticalDiscussion,Voter support for a war policy does not justify that war policy  This isn t even a political point it s a basic logic point  You can t take a premise  voters agree with a war policy and use it to derive an unsupported conclusion  the war policy is justified   Are you trolling  I don t know how I can make my point any clearer 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt they are now forced to cover those with pre existing illnesses   which means I end up paying for it  There s a lot more in play than just that  They also have to spend a certain percentage as payouts for health care meaning they can t have advertising be  of their budget anymore They re not allowed to hike up your rates and pocket that money either  Then there s the mandate people  have to get health insurance  Even healthy young people  Healthy young people don t tend to go to the doctor for things   By all accounts this was a major gift to the health insurance industry especially the mandate They weren t jacking up your rates for  self preservation they were jacking them up because it was still legal to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,e s  I channeled my inner liberal progressive democrat Obama supporter 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sobre mi cad ver  Does that expression really translate directly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stay classy 
PoliticalDiscussion,So are you intimating that income should be equal 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s actually been the expressed strategy of the GOP to reject any big issues of his  Eric Cantor and John Boehner have actually stated a few times that the number  priority is making Obama a  term president even if it means sacrificing other things  We saw that in effect during that whole debt ceiling fiasco  They actually opposed something they knew damn well we had to do  and have done dozens of times in the past decade because Obama was for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not all the rhetoric against  the right was calm and reasonable  People hated Bush and not always for reasons based on fact  Remember the   truther movement  Bush was basically being accused of murdering  US citizens in cold blood  Or remember Sarah Palin  How many people  joked that they would assassinate her if she took office  I think this qualifies as  bitter vitriol    And I think you ll find people in  any political movement who spew vitriol like that     That s just the nature of politics  People are assholes  What I m worried about is painting Obama opponents with a broad brush  It s a basic propaganda technique to respond to your unreasonable opponents rather than your reasonable opponents  You can easily dismantle their arguments  since they aren t based on fact and if you focus on them enough then people will associate the unreasonable arguments with the valid arguments and ignore both  Look at the re nig website  It s written in shitty AOL era style and it isn t affiliated with any respectable organization  It s an unreasonable criticism of the Obama administration  In credibility terms it s roughly on par with the  Timecube guy s website     And yet during an election year you suddenly have the entire media spend a week focusing on  some bullshit that someone happened to write on the internet   Why  Well some blogger was probably searching for an easy strawman to dismantle when they stumbled onto the bumper stickers  Other bloggers and journalists followed suit and eventually the mainstream media picked it up  So now we have a  disproportionate amount of attention   being paid to this website      So now the propaganda effect will kick in and the bad arguments will drive out the good  The only republicans to be given any air time will be the ones who comment on the scandal  And of those who do comment on it only the republicans who make the most outrageous comments will be featured  So GOP politicians will be given incentives to be more and more outrageous while Obama can safely ignore legitimate criticisms against his policies  Just another day in politics    EDIT sorry for the wall of text read the bolded section for a tl dr
PoliticalDiscussion,The president s job  by design  is one of compromise A lot of people don t understand this  It is completely impossible for a president to step in and get  of what he wants  In fact if you have that you re not looking at a president anymore you re looking at a dictator 
PoliticalDiscussion,you must have been in a coma for that whole health care debate 
PoliticalDiscussion, rolls eyes Like you are the ultimate arbiter of  truth  BB 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would wager that is fairly common sense by now  Even your own article admitted that the TARP was far more important than the stimulus   gt Eighteen months later the consensus among economists is that the stimulus worked in staving off a rerun of the s   But the spending s impact was dwarfed by other crisis fighting tools deployed by the Bush and Obama administrations including costly efforts to stabilize crippled banks and the Fed s unconventional monetary policy     
PoliticalDiscussion,National defense   enforcing the laws EQUALLY that the people create 
PoliticalDiscussion,And to do that you equated Bush invading two countries to Obama increasing forces in Afghanistan  You re the one that lumped the two together now you re trying to say you didn t do that Ok  bro  scroll up read your own comments   Are you honestly telling me that you admittedly tried to make an analogy with two things you knew weren t equal  I don t believe that That s absurd Either you re just refusing to admit you made a bad analogy or you just have no idea how analogies work 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree I presented you the spectrum  Clinton Bush McCain where does Obama lie It seems we both agree he is less pro war than the others right Would it be safe to say that he is the least pro war candidate on that spectrum I think so And if that is the case is it still fair to call his policies pro war when he is the least pro war person on the spectrum I don t think it is fair   Already conservatives attack Obama on being soft on being an appeaser of being a dove of backing down to other countries I m honestly trying to understand where the criticism is coming from That you don t agree with is policies is one thing but calling him pro war is another thing entirely   Maybe it is a difference of definitions You say pro war and I think of Bush of fear mongering of blind patriotism But I just don t see that in Obama Are you honestly going to complain Libya to Iraq Don t you think what we did there was appropriate It s all small beans compared to the others I fear the McCains and the Bushes and Gingriches but I m fine with Obama s war policy in comparison  
PoliticalDiscussion,So you re saying no you don t actually have a credible source to back that up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hmmm   I would wager that we wouldn t have much of an economy if a systematic banking collapse occurred   without banks there would be no credit money out of ATMs etc  Businesses would grind to a halt lay off workers etc    That   would ve been worse than a Depression 
PoliticalDiscussion,Once could say they did it out of self preservation because they are now forced to cover those with pre existing illnesses   which means I end up paying for it  Overall I bet my healthcare rates would ve been a lot lower if they didn t mess things up 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes you think that Rome first spoke Common Greek 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Accelerated trial as I understand it limits the number of appeals and the amount of time that each trial can take   I am not familiar with this so it s hard to say I may or may not be ok with accelerated trials If you have a link where I can do some reading I am interested I couldn t find anything in Google after a few minutes of trying   gt The reason I said it in the first post was because terrorists are usually deemed imminent threats therefore to take an extensive amount of time in the legal system would be to allow them to conduct the attack  Awlaki was on the list for several years There was plenty of time for a trial  or at the very least to charge him  My view is this if we can kill him tomorrow we can get him tomorrow too using a special ops and then we don t need a court  same as arrest to do so  Of course I think there should be a trial afterward    gt From a strictly utilitarian perspective there s no comparison  My note  starting from  there have been several excellent articles  was explicitly utilitarian I would wager anything that we re creating far more terrorists through drone strikes than we are killing You kill twenty people but twenty million hear about the ten obvious civilians  and that s ignoring the several strikes that had over a  civilians as casualties can provide links upon request  Plus those ten civilians have a  relatives Repeat this at least twice a month What would you do if you were on the receiving end of such a situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where did I make any claim that Obama s wars are justified or unjustified  I didn t  I only pointed out that voter support is not a sufficient condition for a war to be justified  Reading comprehension bro 
PoliticalDiscussion,My point is that Obama isn t an anti war candidate at all  His record is wildly pro war  Some other candidates might talk a good game but escalating one war trying and failing to prolong another invading a country while ignoring the WPR and bombing assassination campaigns in four other nations is a hell of a score to beat in four years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right but having a hidden agenda doesn t mean forgoing established channels People in  above ground positions of power hide their motives and strategies all the time Guile is useful once your words have influence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Effective in what sense  If you re arguing against the idea of a nation then ofcourse  the way to maximize individual liberty and freedom is to remove any concept of someone  in charge   The thing is s of thousands of years of human history have shown we naturally form social groups with leaders  Democracy and thus electorate by people is currently the  safest way to decide who is in charge  You don t get the best leadership but ideally you wouldn t get the worst  It s the worst form of government aside from all the rest 
PoliticalDiscussion,As I said all of them are preferential choices Obama is no exception The award was given with very little if any actual things done by Obama There is no way I am denying that I also don t claim that it was right to give the prize to Obama  I am not confusing incentives and awards I am saying the Nobel committee is It is an  award for advancing word peace In case of Obama they gave it as an  incentive to advance world peace What I am actually arguing is whether late Mr Nobel would have accepted to use his award as an incentive In any case the award has always been subject to heavy criticism and it will not change  I would like to add that how devilish they may seem they do  always act in good faith I have no doubt that they actually try to give the prize in a way it will actually be beneficial for the entire world Whether they succeed or not is a completely different matter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good now you know why they had to put the caps on it in the first place  They will arbitrarily raise your rates on you just because it s profitable for them Seeing as they have a near  and in some cases complete monopoly there s absolutely nothing you can do about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It depends on the level of government   Federal government should be for federal problems such as national defense and cross state environmental concerns state government should deal with state issues such as highways education and police   City government should deal with local issues such as poverty education crime parks and local roads 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Furthermore most would credit TARP with doing more to save our economy than the stimulus did  You got any credible sources to back that up  Because you re probably the first person who I ve ever heard say that  If I google  TARP did more than stimulus nothing even comes up  I have a hard time believing  most economists would say that when I can t even find  one who says that 
PoliticalDiscussion,It can be a valuable tool when you limit the ability to converse in the language of the elite The points others made here are valid English is too deeply rooted to be replaced by another language sans a big upheaval  However if you consider the state of legalese and the poor state of public education you begin to see that there are a few tiers of proficiency in English Most can t don t decipher complex language or grammar If you don t have the words to describe your plight it goes unsaid If you don t know the wording of the rules you can have no idea what the rules really are presuming they re not incredibly vague as many popular police state terms are  
PoliticalDiscussion,No English is essentially the primary global language especially when it comes to business Certainly the use of Spanish will become more prominent for bi lingual people  perhaps similar to French in parts of Canada  but it will certainly not  take over English 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes because it s the truth and it s for a good cause  Maybe conservatives should ask themselves why it s ok for everyone to call them racists and change their beliefs instead 
PoliticalDiscussion,Downvotes don t bother me first and foremost I don t make it a goal to go for them they just sort of happen often  Second  Emalik made the point that was to be made nail in the coffin   OP is either trolling or an  extremist as others have pointed out might as well make fun of liberals in a shitpost 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I have a hard time believing in conspiracies when a black guy from an underprivileged background  He was not underprivileged He went to a private prep school was raised by middle class white grandparents and attended Harvard Law His Grandma Madelyn worked at a bank and his Grandfather worked as a furniture salesmen  That is not underprivileged At  worst it s middle class 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which credible candidate is more anti war than Obama On both sides of the aisle Bush wasn t McCain wasn t Hillary was more of a hawk than Obama   obliterate Iran  comment   All of the candidates with the exception of Ron Paul are hawks Why are they posturing themselves like that Because Obama isn t a hawk whose rhetoric is all about doom gloom and threats to the rest of the world 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you absolutely equated them You re  still equating them You re saying when Bush did it it was wrong that doesn t mean when Obama does it it s right  That s  absolutely equating them  If you use one to prove or disprove the other you are equating them Otherwise your analogy is not even an analogy 
PoliticalDiscussion, It doesn t sound as simple as Greek being replaced by Latin      gt The Roman empire of course consisted primarily of people who weren t from Rome and especially in the areas we re talking about it consisted of people who were formerly in the greek empire around the coasts of the Mediterranean The greeks had the first real empire like thing around the Mediterranean and also created many settlements Consequently in the time of Christ which wasn t very far into the Roman Empire you must recall greek was the common language  Actually it was Koine greek which is a pretty simplified version of greek                                                                                        gt Although Latin long remained the legal and governmental language of the Roman Empire Greek was the secondary language of the well educated elite as much of the literature and philosophy studied by upper class Romans was written in Greek   In the eastern half of the Roman Empire which would become the Byzantine Empire after the final split of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires in  Greek eventually supplanted Latin as the legal and governmental language and it had long been the lingua franca of Eastern citizens of all classes  Languages have a tendency to break down boundaries They had immigration political shifts and shifting cultural attitudes that allowed Greek and Latin to become the official language of the Roman Empire at different times In the end both languages probably existed in the empire   not unlike English and Spanish in the US   If Mexico dominated the US and created its own Empire then the primary legal language could shift to Spanish but it s not likely with Globalization and our countries existing relations Also ordinary people would still speak and study English It would just shift to a secondary status like Spanish in our society right now  
PoliticalDiscussion,Government s role in the economy was summarized pretty well  here     gt Income inequality isn t just about justice it s about freedom too One view of freedom minimises the state s role in an individual s life and maximizes markets so that individuals are free to risk whatever they want to risk to be whatever they want to be Another view sees the obligation of the state to hedge against the risk of the marketplace so that individuals can feel secure enough to be what they want to be    gt Obviously the libertarian view favours someone who can afford risk the socialist view favours someone who can t One view has confidence in the market while the other is skeptical One view sees income inequality as natural while the other sees it as politically oppressive  Hope that helps 
PoliticalDiscussion,You should erase everything you wrote and just leave this   gt Majority of people you call racist have little to no experience with people their racist against The reason they have those thoughts is because of the people around them and the the things that make them who they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right  You know what they did  They raised the prices before those caps went into affect  Just like they did with my credit card interest rates  Companies are smart like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,According to that article those economists deem it a success by comparing the current economic data with projected data if that stimulus didn t pass   Furthermore most would credit TARP with doing more to save our economy than the stimulus did mainly because much of the stimulus money went to the States to bail them out of their own fiscal crises  
PoliticalDiscussion,The legal definitions of many words and terms are already based on the latin  So in courts the specific words used would refer back to the english and latin roots  This isn t an insurmountable barrier to cultural language shift    The most likely thing to happen is that more spanish words and phrases will work their way into common use  No shortage of chinese will be absorbed as well over the next century  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not equating anything  I m saying that a politician s war policy is not justified by the fact that people voted for them based on this policy 
PoliticalDiscussion,No problem it happens 
PoliticalDiscussion,What is meant by accelerated trial I do not think that is a legal term but I might be wrong   Having a trial is far better than having a judge jury and execution president and if a death sentence is given ok  Overall I would advocate special ops not drone strikes There have been several excellent articles by people who interviewed actual terrorists and interviewed population of the countries we are bombing and found that many of them cited drone strikes and civil deaths from them as reason to attack the US and as reason for becoming a terrorist 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I fully understand that it s unreasonable to expect a group to actually police within themselves but the point is still a valid criticism 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you called him a baby by quoting someone who called all liberals intolerant  This is  r politicalDiscussion  r politicalDiscussion  It was a subreddit created to get away from comments exactly like what you just posted That s why you re being downvoted  If you want to talk like that take it to  r politics  r politics  
PoliticalDiscussion,I was demonstrating that the oppression of blacks at the hands of whites had been occurring for a long time It continued well into the th century The Civil Rights movement occurred in the s and lasted nearly  years   In  the Governor Wallace of Alabama refused black students entrance into the University of Alabama JFK had to call in the National Guard to let them in  There are people alive who remember this and still hold the same view as the late George Wallace This issue isn t as far in the past as we want to think it is   I agree that racism is based on unfamiliarity and lack of understanding we should do something about it A focus on education certainly would help   Like I said elsewhere Republican leaders are in a position to create positive change out of this situation  Also I don t appreciate your ad hominem attacks especially as they re unfounded Stick to arguments not insults 
PoliticalDiscussion,honestly there s a lot of people who just don t like Obama I think The indefinite detention was a huge deal they could use it to convince people to turn from him I mean who in their right mind could support that  And they were right  But Obama took that part out  That s not good they just lost their biggest argument against him 
PoliticalDiscussion,there s also Democrats that are members of the ALF or animal liberation front which is nothing short of a whole wack nut group of terrorist who want to liberate pets       So all Democrats are that now  Why don t they police them selves  Really do I have to say correlation doesn t equal causation   oh wait     Please don t associate all of  r politicaldiscussion with one of reddit He s extremist and he posts this kind of shit all of the time I ve written the mods about him but got no response We re not all like him and he gives liberals a shitty name In fact I m still not convinced that he isn t trolling   yep op is either a dipshit or a troll 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know what my apologies  I wasn t following this thread as closely as I should have been and assumed you were the original guy GIVEMEREPLAY was talking to  I jumped to a bad conclusion  Sorry about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,This  I live in San Diego and can see it becoming bilingual but Spanish is certainly not gaining any kind of dominance 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know what my apologies  I wasn t following this thread as closely as I should have been and assumed you were the original guy GIVEMEREPLAY was talking to  I jumped to a bad conclusion  Sorry about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,They put caps on how much they can go up They kicked in last year and as far as I know no company has been caught breaking that rule  Either you re lying or you re not paying attention Crunch those numbers again  If they went up too much contact them  If your rates really did go up more after the law went into effect you are truly an anomaly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Passing the health care law I can tell you two personal stories about people who benefited    My friend who has had a crazy rare brain cancer since  She wore out her  lifetime maximum and has had a hard time getting care until now She was lucky enough to have rich parents to afford some of the crazy bills but she has had  surgeries and can now get some insurance to cover her medications here in the USA    Another friend has a son with a rare epileptic condition he has had since  months old Because of his  pre existing condition as a baby he could not get on her husbands insurance  to say nothing of the lifetime maximum he also hit So they tried to get on the state insurance plan However the husband made too much money so they couldn t qualify This boy is so sweet and could not get care he needed Once the health care bill passed he was able to be added to the husbands insurance and get the care he needed He has now been seizure free for over  year   Reform to school loan money I personally benefited because I went back to school during the recession  almost a college graduate  and all my loans are thorugh the government not a bank So my interest is going to be lower and the terms better   Credit Card Reform Good for everyone Didn t go far enough but the small amount able to pass has helped small businesses and consumers   I could go on but I have work   He has done amazing things I am proud of him as a president and will vote for him again 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Plenty of people don t vote for reasons other than you might imagine  duh I never made the claim otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion, One of the reason they receive more money is  because of their representation in Congress  The second they lose that by eliminating the Senate they will have no financial incentive to stay in the United States as the more populous states can rig the game in their favor     The other major reason is their lower cost of living which means lower overall incomes which means the US collects less Federal Income Tax from them  Combine this with their lower populations and they will always get more even if Blue States are still getting the lion share   
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly it wasn t the companies they were saving it was the whole industry If none of the supply chain can survive they move causing Ford to have to get parts elsewhere you know how expensive it is to ship things like that from over seas  It s cheaper to just move the factory over seas  Now those jobs are gone and they re not coming back 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fair enough but regardless of whom you are talking about the point stands  Plenty of people don t vote for reasons other than you might imagine 
PoliticalDiscussion,Site has been dismantled Not sure if free market or suppression of free speech I hope it s just the free market and not government intrusion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt the blow to the US job market would have been so hard that they might as well have gone out of business  Yup and that s what matters in this context  It doesn t matter if they re technically still around but has no presence in the US  It wasn t necessarily the companies they were out to save it was the jobs 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not specifically talking about libertarians
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a snide way of calling OP a baby 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Napoleon of the Stump 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re being unfairly down voted for this as it s a completely valid observation  FDR is a Progressive poster child  FDR is also the only president in who has confined American citizens to concentration camps based on their race    Well I mean unless you count the drug war then both parties are equally as culpable  
PoliticalDiscussion,Economists almost unanimously  call it a success    Some anonymous internet guy disagrees  Sorry I m going with the economists on this one 
PoliticalDiscussion,I just don t get the point of denying something as hard as some people want to prove something  If you don t know you don t know   just accept your ignorance lol  
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like people who try to equate Libya and Iraq either have no idea what went on in Libya Iraq or both When they call what happened in Libya a  war  you know right away they have no clue what went on there  It basically came down to the fact that Ghadaffi threatened to bomb the living shit out of Benghazi thus killing potentially tens of thousands of civilians So NATO says  oh no you don t and set up a no fly zone then enforced it  America being part of NATO was somewhat obligated to step in there and help   The US provided mostly tactical support including things like communications and weapons to take out aircraft  No American boots hit the ground in Libya  The actions in Libya prevented tens of thousands of civilians from dying and resulted in very few casualties Anyone who talks about saving tens of thousands of people from dying like it s a  bad thing is either stupid or pushing an agenda 
PoliticalDiscussion,Plenty of Libertarians vote  Plenty don t  Just like plenty of Democrats and Republicans vote and plenty don t  So you re off to a bit of a bad start here    But assuming you re just addressing those Libertarians who do not vote then I think you d do better to understand their motivations rather than just make all kinds of strawmen who fight over false dichotomies no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because that undermines the narrative they are trying to create 
PoliticalDiscussion,But those guys got it after  questionably accomplishing things not before they did it  Hence my point  You re confusing the concepts of incentives and awards and it makes no sense  How Obama was treated was far outside the norm when it comes to how the Peace Prize was issued in every other instance  I don t see why you can t admit that there was some preferential treatment offered to him      gt According to Nobel     shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses   How did Obama meet that by   gt  for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples   After only being President for   months    Most other people who won the prize worked for  decades to help foster peace 
PoliticalDiscussion,You just equated starting two wars with a plan to end two wars  Ramping up the troops in Afghanistan was his  and most of the armed forces bigwigs plan to get out of Afghanistan  Surely you can t say stabilizing a country so you can leave is in any way on the same level as invading two sovereign nations 
PoliticalDiscussion,All our documents are written in English so I just don t see that happening Imagine how many cases in the Supreme Court are decided by precise definitions of specific words  it would be incredibly hard to translate all that if not impossible  Frankly I m pretty astonished that the Romans were able to do it but I imagine that their legal code was much simpler than ours 
PoliticalDiscussion,All I can say is that the reports I read and common sense tell me that we are better off than we would be if this was just left up to the corporations without government regulation    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If we were going to get every single thing a president ever had on his docket three years into his first term no one would ever run for re election  James K Polk  He did exactly that he accomplished everything he set out to do didn t bother to seek reelection  In fact he had apparently accomplished everything he set out to do in life as he died like  months after leaving office too  He s basically the most underrated US President ever 
PoliticalDiscussion,For people with a short attention span     Actually it s just laid out better you can skip to the stuff you care about 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s another pretty concise list   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well him    vetoing  removing the part about indefinite detention from NDAA   was a success  People flipped the fuck out that it was in there yet didn t seem to care when it was removed  I m not really sure what happened  EDIT Sorry poor word choice Didn t realize people were going to get that upset about it  My apologies Here s a link to the  policy directive   he used to do that so people don t try to pick a fight about that too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Renig isn t a real word  It s renege 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe far in the future we could talk a more hibrid language but replace english with spanish sounds out of place to me
PoliticalDiscussion,There are plenty of legitimate disagreements over policy decisions I m not a fan of Obama either when it comes down to it   I do notice your phrasing however There are things you hate about Obama That makes you sound like a rational individual  I m talking about the bitter vitriol and the false equivalency shiv espoused The rhetoric against Bush was largely true He started a war and lied to the country to support it I think that when we look back in hindsight we see that that was actually what was going on   On the other hand the rhetoric I hear about Obama is largely about raising taxes  making  the economy worse  and taking over health care which are patently false I would love to end the stupid discussions and get back to the issues you raise   And instead of calming their base and turning to real issues elected Republicans are some of the worst rabble rousers Boehner has flatly refused to try to quell questions about Obama s birth certificate Each of the Presidential candidates tops the others with patent lies about the world 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s always  r fantasy
PoliticalDiscussion,What logic allows for targeting Americans is a state secret The legal memorandum authorizing it is currently classified When the ACLU requested that it be revealed via the FOIA it was denied as being a classified The ACLU is currently suing the US government with regard to this  See here for more information   
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right and plenty of Democrats speak out against the far left too Both parties have a fringe element and neither party should be judged by it There are going to be other racist bumper stickers that come out and when Romney is the candidate there are going to be bumper stickers and email forwards done in poor taste about him too 
PoliticalDiscussion,The issue with your argument is this  As you note there are no clearly defined sides and so it is impossible to easily determine who is or is not a terrorist  traditional conflict means that person identifies as part of the group publicly and wears a uniform    As you also note there are no identifiable borders   You did not note this directly  though you sort of did with  st century  but the War on Terror is unending or at least indefinite It s been going on for over a decade and there will never be a time when there are no terrorists left   Combine these three things together and you have the president has the power to kill anyone he says is a terrorist in any location at any time either forever or for an indefinite amount of time    gt but I do firmly believe that drones and special strikes are the combat of the st century   I want to point out that these people can be tried without their presence as has been done before many times Drones and special ops can operate without making the president judge jury and executioner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Al Gore Yasser Arafat Mikhail Gorbachev Henry Kissinger just to name a few I am   not  implying that they did not deserve the prize but to point out that they were controversial The decision is always politically motivated Many great benefactors have been left without a reward and simultaneously many not so great people have received the prize Always someone is going to disagree because none of us are saints In some cases many disagree  I don t see the Nobel Peace Prize as an award to be given when one acts for world peace It  should be obvious that every single person works to achieve world peace I see it as a way to give people in power some incentive to actually aim for that goal It is again an ends justify the means argument The means effectiveness can be heavily argued though 
PoliticalDiscussion,what does that have to do with anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Spanish was spoken before than english in North America  Florida Texas California Colorado etc I hope one day all the human beings speak their mother tongue and esperanto 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hell I m ninth cousins with Barbara Bush  for real   I didn t get  my conspiracy card 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that if and when they do use that information it is just used to get more information through more legal channels  As in they see John Doe is a little suspicious in e mails they read by him So they get admissible evidence through court orders and warrants for further investigation they could later use  It s really as others on here stated to better investigate any possibility of serious situations such as terrorism smuggling etc It d be a real waste of time to devote that time to arrest those poor old pirates and pot smokers  Hint They probably don t  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the english spanish relation is closer than what you may think historically speaking The word Britain comes from Britannia an ancient Roman province From Britannia came out Great Britain in Great Britain we have England The English puritans travelled to America and founded the U S who know speak English Latin on the other hand was the official language of the Roman empire at one point Let me emphasize that it was the language that took over the Roman empire hence colonies The Latin language extended all throughout Europe and from the Latin language we have Spanish The Spanish colonists sailed to Central and South America and established Spanish as the primary language   So what I am saying is that Greek was once the common language in Rome but then it gradually switched to Latin English which was born from the Grecian influence is the common language today and it could be engulfed Spanish whose parent language is the same language that engulfed the Greek language back then which is Latin  I hope I got my point through 
PoliticalDiscussion,Help those who cannot help themselves Protect everyone from each other NOT to protect you from yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is why it is important that we also bailed out chrysler even though they are now foreign owned People tend to see the chrysler bailout as a waste but Chryslers market is still almost entirely the US and as a result they will continue to be made over hear as that just makes sense Plus it means in a couple years I ll be able to see Alfa Romeo C s on the road And those things are straight sexy 
PoliticalDiscussion,The French language was once the same way as English is now thus the term  lingua franca  
PoliticalDiscussion,Your French to Canada example has a fallacy The French stopped migrating to Canada long ago Mexicanos and other latinos migrate to the U S in the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands per year  No matter how deep the language is in rooted in society it will inevitably change towards what the masses feel most comfortable when speaking Americans meaning caucasians are having less kids and are marrying at an older age compared to some decades ago meaning that more and more white babies are being born at a lesser rate If this continues give it  years and we should see a U S  Mexican nation 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt On a humorous note is an Onion video joking that Facebook is a secret CIA program    Don t have a facebook page to this day   The CIA has been so thorough in convincing the nation that constantly sharing information about everything that you re doing is somehow desirable instead of deeply unsettling   Yep     gt A safe example was a white paper published by Quantcast showing their results in identity management through simple cookie tracking      The key point is their success in tracking a specific individual across multiple IP s   devices Tack on an academic paper  cannot find  that showed a proof of concept ability to geo locate people within a reasonable distance just by pinging their IP address marco polo style With that an agency or corporation could anonymously track the movements of hundreds of individuals without their knowledge or much risk of exposure  The way I figure we can either design an internet infrastructure which can t be analyzed by any means or that analysis is just going to be possible  One can t stop the march of technology only put it on a new road     gt As for the NSA I don t really care too much about what data they do or do not have because as SOPA demostrated the people required to let the NSA off the chain and publish data on US citizens are kind of techno illiterate stupid  I wonder if people who work at the NSA ever think to themselves  I m glad most everyone else in the government is too stupid to realize the evil things they could do with the information I have   
PoliticalDiscussion,But the US is being conquered by Mexico LA is already above  hispanics  By   of US s population is expected to be Hispanic The greater the number of people the greater the influence the greater the probability of things so deeply enrooted such as the English language to change  
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t say he can sing  I said he did a credible cover  I m with you on Afghanistan  Libya was a UN action and a clear humanitarian crisis  The auto companies  note the plural paid back the bailout  And the spending thing   Obama inherited the biggest structural deficit in American history  and the ugliest financial crisis since the Great Depression  What exactly was the best case scenario for the debt 
PoliticalDiscussion,TIL    that I wonder if they ever have buyer s remorse for that move 
PoliticalDiscussion,What  switch are you talking about Losing the congress was the effect of the tea party aka the small government party Single payer government insurance would have lost him even more support   You keep bringing up democracy like Obama doesn t think about reelection Guess what platform most of his opponents are running on Repealing  Obamacare  It was a risk to do as much as he did already for healthcare   Furthermore employer provided health care should be done away with entirely The only reason employers provide health benefits is because the government gives them a tax deduction for providing them That is it is cheaper to pay an employee in benefits than actual wages This is part of the reason we ve experienced wage stagnation Instead employers should pay their employees the monetary value of their benefits and they can then go and buy healthcare on the open market  
PoliticalDiscussion,I have heard speculation that there s no effective way for the feds to find useful info in the mass of emails etc that they ve grabbed It would take tens of thousands of employees with classified access So they re amassing it on the hopes that eventually software will be better able to sort through it and find the interesting stuff 
PoliticalDiscussion,A government s job is to provide the institutions that are pivotal to economic growth Private property rules and laws  especially ones that encourage innovation  public health education and infrastructure are all important I fully support an interventionist government so long as its interventions drive innovation and creative destruction 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why can t we all just admit that men and women like to have sex with each other and don t intend on having kids every time they do There really is no need for women do defend their  sluttiness   It goes against societal norms and evolutionary biological imperatives Hear me out before you downvote or report me to  SRS Racism is the same way I mean murder is to honestly But the point being society not wanting women to sleep around and have sex with only one man is not something that was invented It s pretty much always been that way I mean adultery is in the bible   Being humans of course it does not mean we need be beholden to nature We overcome it constantly But the view that women should be free to have as much sex as they want is a view that needs to be fought for   So it can t just be admitted that men and women like sex and dont intend to have kids everytime because that s a very recent invention Sex feels good as a way to encourage pro creation A lot of people don t understand that People are afraid of change So it needs to be fought for it needs to be explained   Edit To everyone downvoting me I want to clarify my position with the following excerpt   gt Through history the control of female sexual behavior has been manifested in many different ways Barett et al   describes these systems as  honor and shame systems where the  honor and prestige of a lineage is premised on the chastity of its daughters  The intensity of these cultural codes tend to increase with social status this supports the assumption that higher ranking males tend to have a larger investment in the paternal care of their offspring  Dickeman   These cultural practices are a collection of contexts where men control female chastity and fidelity reduce female mate choice and promote the institutional seclusion and incapacitation of women  Dickeman   Dickeman   illustrates specific examples of sexual control including the insistence that women are virgins before marriage  modest dress restrictions under Islamic law foot binding and chaperoning in public in ancient China and cliterodectomy in Sub Saharan Africa Each of these cases represents a cultural framework constructed to control women s exposure to other people mobility or sexual behavior  thereby helping ensure paternity certainty for husbands and potential fathers  Dickeman    There is scientific evidence that there has been a cultural history across the world of sexual oppression of females That there were evolutionary advantages for men to suppress female promiscuity We are at our cores at our default state in life animals Many people resort to these base behaviours to their ultimate nature often For much of human history there has not been widespread availability of prophylactics This is a recent invention As such we have huge amounts of cultural history of sexual oppression that we need a concerted effort to overcome I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT IS OKAY THAT PEOPLE WANT TO OPPRESS WOMEN SEXUALLY MERELY THAT THE THEIR DESIRE TO DO SO IS A BASE EVOLUTIONARY IMPULSE THAT WE MUST OVERCOME  Secular Humanism is not some sort of default for humanity to live in It s an advanced philosophy that we as humans had to create Stop saying that such cultural views on women are somehow confined to the United States they re not Stop saying polygamy has an evolutionary advantage It doesn t   We as humans have to accept that humans have an evolutionary and cultural nature that often needs to be fought against And please stop assuming that  natural is a synonym for  good  Nature is a fucking asshole Go take a look at ducks with special vaginas that evolved to prevent them being raped or gorillas beating the shit out of other gorillas to maintain their harem of  females or male lions or whatever murdering cubs from different parents 
PoliticalDiscussion,FYI the slut walk originated in Canada long before Limbaugh s comments and had more to do with attitudes towards rape  I think the idea that it s a  war on women is a bit simplistic  The  war largely has to do with abortion issues and men just don t get pregnant so it shouldn t be surprising that it seems like it targets women but men have just as much to gain and lose when it comes to contraceptives and abortion  It just so happens due to biology that these are considered  women s issues  but I m not convinced that opposition to them is really an attack on women so much as opposition to the moral concepts behind them  The contraceptive debate is about what they feel is government forcing employers to cover things they might be morally opposed to which is consistent with their overall views and not specifically a woman s issue  If they opposed contraceptives in general why have there been no anti contraception protests like we see with abortion  I think they re also less concerned with the idea of a woman  making her own reproductive choices than with what they perceive as the termination of a human life  Again if the issue were about reproductive choices where are all the anti tubal ligation protests  Women aren t the only ones who fear the idea of getting pregnant either so the idea that this is a  war on women or that these are even issues of  women s rights has always struck me as being a bit disingenuous and only worded this way to increase support from women and change the focus of the debate 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is true I ve seen it  to all the downvoters   Glen Beck to leader of democratic socialists of America  How can you say they were not socialists they had socialist right there in their name National socialist Are you telling me that you get to decide if they were socialists or not   Something like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly spoken honestly upvoted    I actually lurk the variety of political subreddits via the following link        politicaldiscussion is one of the few subreddits out there that isn t overwhelmingly populated by any specific  faction  and the comments here are usually more intelligent and articulated than what you find in some of the others so I specifically asked   here   
PoliticalDiscussion,I was thinking specifically of government conspiracies  There s no spaceship at Wright Patterson AFB  We don t have a secret facility in Alaska that controls the weather   Is the government controlled by a small group of well connected people  Sure  They re called campaign donors  They don t operate in secret because they don t have to 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I am honestly curious to know if your  average Tea Party member considers Ike a great President  I ll be honest with you I don t believe you Why if that were your curiosity would you ask a bunch of liberals and libertarians That s what Reddit is   gt But if it makes you feel better  It doesn t Nor would I consider such motivations sinister but maybe I m just a bad guy I consider argumentation to be value free 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just playing your game  You insinuated that I had resorted to attacking you which isn t true 
PoliticalDiscussion,You read a novel into a paragraph there I found the juxtaposition between what a Republican President had to say about a specific subsection of citizens  then  in comparison to the power that subsection wields in that party   now   to be an interesting one   I am honestly curious to know if your  average Tea Party member considers Ike a great President  and if not why as well as what Ike would have thought about the Tea Party movement  and the current state of his party in general  if he could tell us   But if it makes you feel better to ascribe sinister motivations like I was an aglet go ahead It s a free subreddit after all 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just playing your game  Lol you re projecting like a movie theater 
PoliticalDiscussion,He surged forces in Afghanistan and flew bombing missions over Libya He pumped a ton of American tax dollars into a dieing company not industry He  arguably spent the country into an oblivion Plus he can sing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Welcome to American law where laws policies budgets and pretty much anything else can be and are reversed all the time  That s a bullshit analogy In order to reverse laws and budgets you have to pass a law through congress In order to indefinitely detain someone a president would have to draft a policy directive As easy as opening up a word document and pressing print    gt if Obama had written  no indefinite detentions ever for any reason the guy who came after him does not have to follow that  Exactly That s the whole reason Obama should be ravaged by American citizens for signing this tyrannical law   Now that NDAA is codified it allows presidents to indefinitely detain anyone  including American citizens    All they have to do is offer a policy directive to allow it   Obama claimed he was going to be vigilant about protecting American s civil liberties while pursuing terrorists He hasn t His supporters should admit as much 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have no idea German and Russian I can do but Spanish gives me a migraine 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because it s ok for guys duh  In all seriousness the reason why men aren t being talked about is that they re held to a different standard than women We ve seen this since our school years guy makes out with a lot of girls PLAYER Girl makes out with a lot of guys SLUT 
PoliticalDiscussion,I updated my verbiage you can calm down now 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And who makes this judgement With what authority is it made What if someone involved does not respect that authority  A monopolised state system is supposed to provide the sort of justice the people want if it s democratic but it doesn t actually manage this because the incentives aren t real  Actors within a polycentric system would actually have those incentives and we re presuming that the people would still want justice  if they don t then even a genuinely democratic government would also fail to provide it  Though there would be more than one provider a common law would develop  The different providers would be competing for clients  competing to provide the dispute arbitration people want for the lowest cost  but they would have incentives to cooperate to some degree the same way insurance companies cooperate to settle claims between themselves out of court to save costs  Violence does not save money when you re the one paying for it  even organised crime families know this  Only government can wage wars because they don t really pay for anything themselves   gt Of course it has incentives provide justice Judges can be impeached politicians can be elected out of office people protest etc  No children are taught in the government s elementary schools that this is the case but it s just collective wishful thinking  Judges  aren t impeached bad politicians  aren t elected out of office to be replaced with good ones and when people protest they are beaten shot and caged at worst and ignored at best

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Of course this policy directive can be reversed at any time  Welcome to American law where laws policies budgets and pretty much anything else can be and are reversed all the time  Guess what even if Obama had written  no indefinite detentions ever for any reason the guy who came after him  does not have to follow that    They ve been doing that long before Obama and they ll likely do it long after him 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are no line item vetos Obama couldn t veto just the indefinite detention from the bill   He signed the bill and wrote a policy directive against indefinite detention     Of course this policy directive can be reversed at any time   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The article clearly states that this executive directive can be removed by a future president  Even if removed completely it could be added back the next time they do an NDAA by a different president and the same or different congress Obama can t sign something into law that has to be obeyed by the guy after him that s not how this works  The NDAA didn t  give him the power to do that all it did was codify something they ve been doing for years that s why it was in this piece of legislature to begin with  So basically leaving it out of the bill wasn t going to stop anyone in the future from doing it and putting in it that no one after him is allowed to do it is completely unenforceable However this directive is absolutely enforceable while he s in office  It doesn t matter how much you hate Obama what he did was the only way to reduce that from happening for the next  hopefully  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where in my statements did I classify Obama as anti war I never said such a thing so go ahead and attack that strawman    gt Obama is decidedly on the pro war spectrum and if his rhetoric says otherwise politicians lie  But where on the spectrum Go ahead put people on a line as you see fit and where does Obama fit Let s say right is pro war and left is anti war who is to the left of Obama Who And if no one is to the left of him and you continue to call him pro war then your interpretation of the spectrum isn t useful   Correct me if I m wrong but to you the actual scale of the military operation doesn t matter A small skirmish Pro war Nuclear bombs Pro war Drones Pro war Are they all equal I should think not    gt Then your definition is incredibly biased it appears perfectly tailored to attack political enemies while absolving your own tribe for functionally identical acts   No As I said in the beginning I told you to put politicians  of both parties on a spectrum and tell me who is to the left and who is to the right This isn t about Republicans and Democrats You are the one who brought up parties   gt If what we did there was appropriate then so was Iraq then Iraq was a greater success by the metric of  non theocratic dictators in power    No way I don t think anyone could reasonably equate our involvement in Libya to our involvement in Iraq    gt Nothing you said here amounted to anything but  It s ok when my tribe does it  Disgusting  I never made this a partisan issue I am trying to bring perspective concerning Obama s philosophy on war Let me repeat myself this isn t about the Left or the Right You are the one who keeps bringing that up But these issues are important to me as I assume they are to you  My argument is still that Obama is one of the least pro war presidents we ve had Call him pro war if you want but my point is that from all the current and past candidates he is the least pro war of that lot  
PoliticalDiscussion,See You can t even do this without resorting to attacking me It s pretty sad    gt  It looks like one republican got most of what he wanted while the house as a whole    This is intellectually dishonest because you re leaving out the fact that the  one republican is the  speaker of the house  When he makes a public statement it s on behalf of the house    gt  Obama has consistently refused to compromise on anything of substance  This has been disproved numerous times throughout the thread and yet you repeat it   So tell me   You ignore everything that disproves your preconceived notions and resort to personal attacks when someone calls you out on it What are you even doing in this subreddit  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Anyone can use force in proportional reciprocation to force the only judgement that matters is whether or not this is in fact how and why force was applied  And who makes this judgement With what authority is it made What if someone involved does not respect that authority   gt How does a government overcome the fact that it has no real incentives to provide justice  Of course it has incentives provide justice Judges can be impeached politicians can be elected out of office people protest etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see it cutting both ways  A national candidate with major press coverage has prestige that could help win a primary  But on the other hand a hardy challenger who actually spends all his time in KY might have the advantage over the candidate who s trying to run the KY campaign from Iowa and New Hampshire    Rand is  so he has plenty of political carreer ahead of him  Suppose the following scenario  Rand spends all of  campaigning for Republican congressional candidates all over the country helping them raise money and making friends with their donors  A democrat miraculously wins the  election and Rand Paul makes a serious challenge for the  race  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not being dishonest at all Obama has consistently refused to compromise on anything of substance If you could form a thought without getting step by step instructions from the dnc you would likely be able to reach the same conclusion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Aren t most conspiracies about private power groups who rule behind the shadows  Or are you just saying bodies of government in general  including those supposed groups of people with loads of resources  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not really familiar with how duel campaigns have turned out in the past It will be interesting if he s not in a secure incumbent position in Kentucky 
PoliticalDiscussion,Quit playing politics and read the article he linked  Nowhere does it say that he vetoed that portion of the law  The line item veto was outlawed by the Supreme Court in the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Come on let s be honest here  He didn t veto it he issued a policy directive  That basically amounts to him saying  I promise I won t abuse that power   The article clearly states that this executive directive can be removed by a future president but it could also be removed by this president under the guise of a national emergency or something similar  To the issue about vetoing certain parts of bills the Supreme Court unfortunately outlawed the line item veto in the s 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well there is a lot of warantless spying going on As one example AT T was involved They didn t get in trouble because they were working WITH the government  In fact IIRC AT T was effectively retroactively pardoned for it s activity   Which leads back to my original question of why one would assume that the entities sniffing for military weapons stuff and those sniffing for personal info are totally separate  Edit  somehow  this link   didn t make it into my reply 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We can have actual legitimate and profound differences on how government is run without resorting to hyperbolic statements like  All Republicans are racist   which is what is implied in this video or the equally caricatured  Progressives and liberals are socialists intent on destroying America   Obviously I agree with the first part I also agree with the second part HOWEVER   I see no problem with saying Progressive liberal democrats are socialists and communists A lot of people hear that and add in the  intent on Destroying Amurica part but that isn t what I said I understand that most socialist communists believe they are trying to make the country better They are not evil they are just wrong  So I agree the tone could come down on the right in the  Destroying Amurica department But there is nothing wrong with pointing at the guy who says he wants to spread the wealth around and calling him a socialist communist It s like a math teacher being offended that someone dare call him a mathematician   gt It s not okay but there is a difference between using humor  however bad it was to showcase a real problem like racism and people actually being racist It s a false equivalency  I m confused at what my false equivalency is This wasn t a fundraiser to stop racism   The sketch wasn t done to try and make people end the scourge of race based decisions It was a fundraiser for a school and the only apparent reason a white man dressed in blackface and caveman garb holding a giant stuffed ape was present was to bash the conservatives at the school This is  actual racism It doesn t matter that the people doing it are card carrying liberals  it is racism  If the people on stage were bashing Democrats do you think this video would be available on CNN ABC NBC CBS MSNBC or discussed in the NY Times LA Times Chi Tribune and every other newspaper or news station in America  EDIT And if the school is such a racist hellhole why are these liberals auctioning off   worth of shit to support the school Fuck   my school bake sales wouldn t make more than  bucks not     
PoliticalDiscussion,Are there any American citizens currently in indefinite military detention 
PoliticalDiscussion,Watergate is actually a great example of why most conspiracy theories are fiction  Nixon s black bag team turned out to be the most incompetent burglers in the history of the world  Government is a big dumb animal  It simply isn t capable of keeping anything significant secret for long 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe your imagination needs work the government CAN use all of the data gathered via the NSA just not within the framework of the judicial system Working outside of the judicial system is something the other arms of the government are extremely comfortable with doing   How is this possible you ask Simple indefinite detention of suspected terrorists You don t need to be proven guilty of anything in a court of law only suspected Emails and electronic communications are perfect for establishing these sorts of suspicions 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re being intentionally dishonest You know it too 
PoliticalDiscussion,And who decides this The NLRB The marketplace 
PoliticalDiscussion,They do  It usually is the first generation that speaks their home language as their primary language  Second generation is fluent in both languages and uses their home language at home and English at work and at school  Third generation rarely speaks their grandparent s language and if they do they aren t fluent  My dad grew up in Michigan to Polish parents and his parents spoke broken English and he spoke Polish at home and in their neighborhood but spoke English fluently at school and at work  My brothers and I speak only a few Polish words and phrases and we re American as can be  It has always been like that and it will be the same way with the new wave of Central American immigrants 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t see any proof there not quite sure what you re referring to in that article It looks like one republican got most of what he wanted while the house as a whole who got an overwhelming mandate from the country to cut spending got next to none of what they wanted What does that have to do with the healthcare debate where republicans were totally shut out because they didn t have the numbers to stop the democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anyone can use force in proportional reciprocation to force the only judgement that matters is whether or not this is in fact how and why force was applied  Why is it that a monopoly provides bad service in all cases but security or the provision of law and order  How does a government overcome the fact that it has no real incentives to provide justice 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the Paul family has a  bid in mind  I wonder how it will work with Rand having to run for President and Senate at the same time given that he will likely have a challenger in the Republican primary for the Senate seat  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I confirm that Not quite coloquial though more of something you d read in a comic book 
PoliticalDiscussion,Replace English No way English has already become far too important on a global scale to be completely replaced with something else Maybe the common person will begin to speak Spanish as a second language but that s the furthest I see it going unless the US is conquered by Mexico or something of that nature 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that s a pretty vulnerable time for the Democrats  or Republicans if they ve held the office for  years  However it s still important to not alienate moderates Depending on how Obama s  presumed second term goes Rand could have a real chance 
PoliticalDiscussion,That has literally no bearing first of all it s not a War Congress has not declared war and the President cannot secondly the soldiers are technically there to protect the civilians as a peacekeeping force therefore he should be tried in a Afghan court AND court martialled for it
PoliticalDiscussion,It s interesting that you ve already been given proof that directly contradicts everything you ve said and yet you re still saying it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes he is a disgusting and appalling human being apparently the War in Afghanistan is over terrorism correct And the Afghani s want foreign intervention to stop Thus American and British troops are the invading troops and therefore they are the terrorrists in this situation a single civilian killed is too many in this war  I m sorry but if a Afgan soldier came to America killed  civilians and was then extradited back to Afghanistan the entire world would be outraged it happens vice versa and there are people who honestly believe that the soldier should be brought home 
PoliticalDiscussion,So my point on texts at least is this  if it s illegal to intercept mail then that logic can quickly extend to making it illegal to intercept email texts and so on IANAL and I don t know of relevant laws or cases on this but there is reason to believe that if someone intercepts your personal communications and uses that information against you they can be tried for a variety of different crimes and sued for defamation  I d really like to hear a lawyer with relevant experience speak on this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shouldn t interstate highways be more of a federal thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,I pretty much agree  One possible difference  Running on purely the GOP base will work any time a democrat has been in office for  years  Otherwise not so much  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The article goes on to assert that because wealthy people have power US economic policy has become a mixture of socialism for the rich and capitalism for everyone else I tend to agree with that sentiment  The poor get socialism not capitalism Occupational licensing laws keep poor people from competing in the job market Emission testing and expensive registration prevents many poor people from owning cars Social security robs the working poor of   of their income and transfers it to wealthy retirees Poor people get royally fucked by socialism 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe the recent twitter case involved a warrant and that warrant asked for all relevant account information  So presumably if twitter was spying on you in other ways that would ALSO be covered by the warrant  Not just username and passwords and stuff  I can t say how often companies are reading your texts and I can t say whether they care about what they do read but it s dangerous to assume people are NOT reading your texts   That doesn t make it right or even legal for them to do so of course  
PoliticalDiscussion,In the end their role is whatever the majority decides   I think the role of the government is to enact and enforce laws and policies that we decide are necessary 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think he s more electable that Ron although I think he would have the same problem in a general election that any  Tea Party candidate would have I think running on purely the GOP base is a losing strategy 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If they re doing it and they can t use it why are they doing it   YUP To stop a nuke a chemical weapon biological virus or hacker that could shut down a power plant s core or open floodgates on a dam  shit like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,But so far I don t think any charges have come about from the information they gave Not saying that completely nullifies the act though  Was that obtained with a warrant do you know  And I assume that companies are not reading my text messages although this might not be accurate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh no  my point is that if we take the amassed data on US citizens as a fact for the sake of argument you also have to acknowledge the fact that it seems to be used for nothing at all Never mind whether it s all able to be analyzed in an appropriate time frame it s simply worthless information because of among other things constitutional protections against warrantless search and the assumption that one should be secure in his her  papers  
PoliticalDiscussion,Where did you get that from Income inequality exists so the question is whether government  should do anything about it There are different perspectives about that There are various reasons for why someone might or might not want government to intervene into the economy  The  article goes on to assert that because wealthy people have power US economic policy has become a mixture of socialism for the rich and capitalism for everyone else I tend to agree with that sentiment as during the recession I didn t hear about anybody from Wall Street who got fired without a golden parachute while big banks were busy kicking people out of their homes That doesn t mean it didn t happen I m not yet willing to jump to conclusions or  load my musket  so to speak  However the libertarian and socialist viewpoints and their economic implications spelled out in the prior post stand on their own merits The spectrum of wanting government in the economy runs along one s adherence to or skepticism of free market principles   Libertarian and socialist ideologies fall out of a reliance on those principles and republicans and democrats historically move economic policy along the spectrum of socialism and libertarianism given  a responses to the marketplace  ex new technologies lobbyists foreign markets and  b general skepticism adherence to free market principles by the entire body politic Not individuals or groups of regular citizens mind you but more like the political climate in general 
PoliticalDiscussion,If anything  was an indictment against the primary system Polls showed that John McCain  version  was the Condorcet winner of that election but unfortunately did not win his party s primary and could not be voted for in the general election 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because they would be in violation of their mission   Congressional Inquiries would result careers flushed  I thought you meant  Why hasn t this been seen in Court via lawsuits to stop this crap  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not okay but there is a difference between using humor  however bad it was to showcase a real problem like racism and people actually being racist It s a false equivalency  Personally though I say a pox on both their houses We can have actual legitimate and profound differences on how government is run without resorting to hyperbolic statements like  All Republicans are racist   which is what is implied in this video or the equally caricatured  Progressives and liberals are socialists intent on destroying America  Both sides have actual concerns that need to be considered and addressed We get nowhere when we stop listening to the other side in favor of ridiculing them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Twitter for example was just in the news for giving out the account information related to Occupy Boston  This kind of stuff is in the news regularly especially if you include ISPs giving up information  Do you really trust that all of this monitoring is being used for good purposes only at the  military weapons level  To turn the question around if you did have some embarrassing but completely legal activities going on  e g  sexting as part of a secret affair  would you be comfortable with it being monitored by a lot of different companies 
PoliticalDiscussion,What are you talking about The Romans never spoke Greek before switching to Latin The Greeks on the southern coasts spoke Greek If the Romans spoke Greek they would have been considered Greek This was how the ancient Greeks distinguished Greeks from barbaroi  in addition to having the same mythologies gods and oracles but mostly the language thing  The Greeks could barely even condescend to elaborate too much about the barbarians whose  bar bar talk was hardly worth more than animal sounds   Now the Greek language  and culture swept through Rome despite being under the Roman hegemon But that was because the native Roman culture was shit compared to the Greek one the Romans were just pugilistic yet militarily savvy barbarians with a piety streak And the Romans knew this Horace put it better than I will   Graecia capta ferum victorem ceptit et ratios intuit agresti Latio  Roughly  Greece although conquered took captive her savage conqueror and imposed her character on rustic Latium  The Latin  artes encompasses more than its derive  arts  including culture wiles science knowledge and the like  agresti has a more pejorative sense than  rustic  something closer to hick yokel or something similar   Also this is nothing like the English Spanish relationship or the relationship between the US and any Spanish speaking nation  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right technically not a veto he threatened a veto and it was removed before landing on his desk  They actually released a  policy directive   later specifically to solidify that indefinite detention was not allowed 
PoliticalDiscussion,A lie is perfectly acceptable so long as you have the capacity to not have your lie be proven as a lie  
PoliticalDiscussion,My point is that it hasn t Ever Not that anyone on here has pointed out at least and not that the media has reported on loudly enough for Reddit to notice 
PoliticalDiscussion,In re metapunditedgy when have you ever heard of any of that information being used  against somebody I understand there s a principle at play here but really is there any evidence that someone at Google or Facebook has ever blackmailed someone else because of their purchases off AdamandEve com 
PoliticalDiscussion,This The issue with Obama isn t what he s done for the most part but what he hasn t done 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why wouldn t people just learn English as every other wave of immigrants have done since the nation was founded 
PoliticalDiscussion,I want to point out that I agree with you I m more bringing up this question as evidence against such surveillance by the NSA If they re doing it and they can t use it why are they doing it   The government even trying to introduce evidence obtained illegally though this program would be a constitutional nightmare Huge swaths of what the NSA and other securities agencies would do would come under fire from the public and Congress I simply can t imagine that the  worst fears of people like Drake  in the article are actually based in truth 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the difference with Facebook and Google is that they are tracking you as part of their marketing studies  They are also not the Gov t nor are they forcing you to use their search engines services etc  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would you draw a distinction between facebook and the NSA  Do you think the  watchers are clearly defined into separate groups that either want to  monitor sincere and military threats to the public or  gather personal information that can be used against us in our everyday lives in a million different ways  Install the  collusion plug in and see who is tracking you  Facebook is right there in the middle of it all with Twitter Google etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,Monarchy works because the next monarch is raised from birth to be a monarch taught politics morality history governance etc  Unless you have an aristocracy which can store and transmit such knowledge from generation to generation a potentially viable monarch will never be born  
PoliticalDiscussion,And lay the foundation for a possibly  legitimate run by Rand  
PoliticalDiscussion,income equality doesn t mean that all income should be equal it means income should be relative to the amount and quality of work you put out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Greek was also widely used during this time IIRC patricians continued to speak Greek even after Latin became the language of the plebs 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m pretty sure the provision was not removed and that Obama signed the bill instead of vetoing it  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I disagree I presented you the spectrum  Clinton Bush McCain where does Obama lie It seems we both agree he is less pro war than the others right Would it be safe to say that he is the least pro war candidate on that spectrum I think so And if that is the case is it still fair to call his policies pro war when he is the least pro war person on the spectrum I don t think it is fair  I completely disagree  Classifying Obama as  anti war is an absurd and dishonest attempt to shift the middle wildly   War neutral would be not starting any more and more or less just following the plan on current ongoing ones probably swaying with public opinion polls  Obama is  decidedly on the pro war spectrum and if his rhetoric says otherwise   politicians lie     gt Already conservatives  I m libertarian not a conservative   gt You say pro war and I think of Bush of fear mongering of blind patriotism   Then your definition is incredibly biased it appears perfectly tailored to attack political enemies while absolving your own tribe for functionally identical acts  Or does Harry Reid calling Rand Paul a terrorist sympathizer on the Senate floor for fighting the PATRIOT Act qualify as  fear mongering   How about Eric Holder s argument that the War on Terror justifies the assassination of American citizens and that the declared battlefield is  Everywhere    gt Don t you think what we did there was appropriate  If what we did there was appropriate then so was Iraq then Iraq was a greater success by the metric of  non theocratic dictators in power     Nothing you said here amounted to anything but  It s ok when my tribe does it   Disgusting 
PoliticalDiscussion,The NSA can just pull the  state secrets crap and say that revealing the data and the nature by which it obtained is a state secret and reviewing it in open court would give enemies potential insight into out capabilities  Complete horse shit since I thought the NSA was forbidden from operating on US soil   
PoliticalDiscussion,   Evidence obtained in violation of the constitution is generally not admissible in court  The exceptions are narrow and what the NSA s doing doesn t fit one    That and believe it or not the NSA does not give a shit who smokes pot  They just want to know where the North Korean nuclear weapons are and whether or not potential hijackers have entered the country  In terms of violating people s privacy in materially harmful and morally objectionable ways Facebook is probably a thousand times worse than the NSA  
PoliticalDiscussion,TIL
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you in accounting 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s based on a lifetime of interacting with people and noticing how poorly secrets get kept  Once three people know assume everyone knows 
PoliticalDiscussion,Think about it You are basing that on pubicly available information If a secret was kept then by definition you wouldnt know about it You dont have all the data You would have to be omniscient to make the claim youre making Your claim is just as irrational as that of conspiracy theorists  Really I expected better from this subreddit   
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the economic sharks are well beyond rehabilitation and I don t see why we should have to bother  If you re going to capriciously ruin tens of thousands of lives in finance I feel absolutely no regret in seeing you hanged immediately 
PoliticalDiscussion,  United States   gt a republic is a state that does not practice direct democracy but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people  Nominating delegates is the way the Republicans do it   gt Ron Paul is silencing the voice of the People  Nonsense  He s giving a voice to his supporters and playing by the rules 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that Spanish will be assimilated into English rather than replace it American English will slowly pick up more Spanish words and pronunciations over time and eventually it will become its own distinct dialect Assuming of course that language in the digital age behaves the same as language thousands of years ago I think that the evolution of language slows down as our ability to record information and communicate over large distances increases 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s totally understandable Many people get an unfair roll of the dice But at the same time everyone in the country knows that murder is illegal So why are they any less guilty than the person raised in the wealthy suburb 
PoliticalDiscussion,So most of Chomsky s social political research is invalid here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uhm   link bombs usually contain links Also a republic is a kind of democracy It s called representative democracy  Furthermore the governed have  clearly made it known that they do not want Ron Paul to be their president He has not won a single state and he has the fewest popular votes of any candidate You can t pretend that he has the consent of the governed when he clearly does not   The fact remains that Ron Paul is silencing the voice of the People and to deny them their voice is to go against the very principles that this nation was founded upon 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you think Noam Chomsky s analysis of the historical record is highly flawed Please elaborate in detail if you don t mind since you are evidently very confident in your own analysis 
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically I work      but realistically I work  until   well it s  right now
PoliticalDiscussion,Mexico and the U S are on the same continent so naturally the majority of illegals will be from Mexico since its easier access for them due to proximity and most Canadians aren t exactly falling over themselves to get into the U S since they like their country more than ours If the U S was stuck in the middle of Europe then we wouldn t have to worry about Mexicans wanting to work in our country illegaly but then we would have to worry about the influx of terrorists from the Middle East Africa and Asia 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt derive their just powers from the consent of the governed  That says nothing about democracy  The governed could consent to a monarchy   gt it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it  And we Ron Paul People are trying to abolish establishment presidential tyranny   gt our nation was founded upon  The nation was found as a republic not a democracy  Last time I link bomb you with information you ungrateful arse 
PoliticalDiscussion,One person can keep a secret sometimes  people  But more than that and people never resist the temptation to blab for long 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes like     Your not conservatives anymore and everyone else isn t liberal  That s like calling Al Quada conservative crazy liberals are crazy whether they pretend to be backed by religion or not   
PoliticalDiscussion,I m more for guilty parties like that rather than receive the death penalty to literally pay their duties to society ie pay all the financial damages they caused And then on top of that rehabilitation in prison or whatever facilities 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s less of a focus on sentencing as a solution to crime here in Canada so there was never such things as  three strikes you re out   Its just always been a bit more liberal here in a lot of areas of policy  This is changing because of our neoconservative government which seems to want to ape the failed policies of the Bush administration  e g mandatory minimum jail time for such minor crime as cultivating marijuana    Also there is no private prison system here lobbying for stiff sentences etc Because corporate America has such power and the prison system is corporate the people have no chance  Prisons are a system used by capitalists to control the poor and keep them in check but in America they are also a for profit enterprise which generates billions and a massive source of lobbying money  Those lobbyists work towards stiff sentences higher incarceration rates and more and bigger jails  One of the biggest private prison corporations in America is GEO Group who have recently been lobbying our government heavily in a number of areas including the aforementioned mandatory minimum sentences 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe in rehabilitation as opposed to extermination  I mean think about this person A was brought up in a sub standard neighbourhood and exposed to all areas of crime throughout his life Ends up as part of a gang and through the gang culture that exists he brings himself to murder at some point  Obviously this person is guilty of murder however with rehabilitation there s no reason this person can t go on to live within society once again It seems ridiculous to me to kill someone for what they ve done when they could of had a hard life and a crime like this was a high statistical probability for them  Maybe I am just extremely empathetic but even though the loss of an innocent life is tragic the loss of the guilty life to me wouldn t help the situation at all 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt people s inability to keep secrets  That s simply not true in the absolute People are quite capable of keeping secrets 
PoliticalDiscussion,You should take your mind off that go out and get laid 
PoliticalDiscussion,Governments are supposed to derive their just powers from the consent of the governed Whenever a government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it I firmly believe in the principles that our nation was founded upon I am sad to see that Ron Paul and his supporters do not 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not an attack it s a demonstrable observation I explained exactly how it was intellectually dishonest See this statement   gt It looks like one republican got most of what he wanted while the house as a whole who got an overwhelming mandate from the country to cut spending got next to none of what they wanted   states that John Boehner does not speak for the representatives elected on a platform of cutting spending i e Republicans Are you honestly trying to claim that Speaker of the House a prominent Republican does not speak for his party and colleagues the people who it s  his job to represent  Because if you are then me saying  You re being intentionally dishonest is clearly not an attack because it would be giving you the benefit of the doubt    I do believe the president was negotiating in good faith  John Boehner  As a side note your premise that the passing of the health care reform act is some how antithesis to the goals of fiscal conservatives is unfounded and laughable The majority of the legislation was put forward by The Heritage Foundation in the s   And I guess the real reason why I know you re intellectually dishonest is because what you re trying to argue can be  disproved in a  second google search   So what s it going to be Intellectually dishonest Or woefully uninformed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah poor choice of words on my part It just sounds sort of cliched to say  even one person is too much  I agree with the sentiment I just didn t want to sound lame 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m running as a democrat against a democratic incumbent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Haha yeah She deals with the state and federal level  bipartisan initiatives almost exclusively so she basically told me tips and tricks for campaigning who to avoid who could give me sound advice etc It was actually pretty good   
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul is playing by the rules that are there historically or were set up to favor Romney  He s not running as a Democrat and democracy has major flaws   two wolves and a sheep voting on what s for dinner  aka the tyranny of the majority  argumentum ad populum  manufacturing consent  mob rule  election vote fraud  see also Lysander Spooner
PoliticalDiscussion,But what if you were in the shoes of an innocent victim s family Imagine an immediate family member being killed in cold blood With no reason Picture one of them Do you still feel the same way 
PoliticalDiscussion,that s a very solid point  my thinking was that if you create a community in a certain area and have the ability to create test in small batch down the street from where the idea came from it would be something like a start up or tech industry feel for a great variety of projects 
PoliticalDiscussion,   No MSM covered it at least not on the first page of google Also Rush at least apologized 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am not saying the American system is great or anything But I would rather them be kept away from me and mine rather than left on the streets to do it again I m happy to pay taxes to keep them away from me I pay for walls and locks and doors to keep strangers away from my stuff already Way more than the taxes I pay 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ha  I called into Mark Davis show in Dallas and ended up talking about this very issue Here some shameless self  promotion    tl dl  I m against it as a matter of in my opinion pragmatism 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about literally Hitler 
PoliticalDiscussion,I object personally I tentatively support the death penalty however if someone killed me I would not want them executed and wouldn t push for it if a loved one were executed I support it s use as a deterrent  which is why I m tentatively in favor since there isn t proof that it works as a deterrent  because I believe it is Just but am against it s use when it s up to my discretion for religious reasons 
PoliticalDiscussion,That people are afraid of change  agreed Could it be that men are afraid to admit that their relationship  even a monogamous one  might be considered immoral Could it be that most men are actually standing solidly behind their  slut and the choices she makes but don t voice that because they don t know that other men are also in the same position That times as well as minds have changed  coming out is all that is left  I posted a question similar to OP s on this reddit  wondering what would happen if men came to the realization that politicians trying to control women s behavior are really attempting to control theirs too 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand your arguments for the death penalty  I also understand opponents arguments against it  My position is simple and does not involve weighing pros and cons or analyzing never ending and ambiguous statistics    No person and no government has the moral authority to kill someone else  The   only  situation in which the killing of another person is justified is to stop or to prevent the very probable and imminent killing or severe injuring of another human being and only when no other option at hand would effect that purpose    Obviously killing a person who is physically restrained by being strapped onto a gurney and who can effectively be prevented from ever seriously harming another person ever again does not meet that criteria    Personally I have no sympathy for murderers etc who die quick and painless deaths by execution  They probably deserve much worse than that  especially since the vast majority of the rest of us will suffer horribly before we die   But a government does not have the authority  in my opinion to grant someone the authority to kill someone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,My idea is to make it all free market  i e  private sector  just within the confines of the current system This could be accomplished with things like the massive tax incentives and state representation of your field The only way at all this could work is if the government created the framework for the private market to flourish in these productions  Though I feel this would lead to a lot of those guys like in Office Space who speak for the engineers because they re good with people Not a bad thing though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes it s a  day old thread but you ve said some things that relate to things I ve been thinking for a while and heck I don t often get to discuss political philosophy with a fellow Ottawanianerist even though you d think this would be the best city for it  I think the important point you raise is that the government we choose must reflect the psychology of the people being governed and who are governing I think that explicit requirement is what is missing in discussion and we solve the problem haphazardly  In my view the goal of government is to create promote a strong resilient society that is able to compete with other societies  in whatever sense of compete you choose and is able to adapt readily to change The arguments we collectively have are about the best way of doing that  The proponents of Capitalism Libertarianism Socialism Communism on the economic spectrum and social conservatism progressivism on the social spectrum seem to all say that their way is the best way Communists make sure that everyone is looked after but don t consider greed and laziness Capitalism works great to motivate people but doesn t consider the long term public good or how to deal with monopolies And I think you pointed out that Libertarianism almost needs a government just to keep it going against human nature  But Canada and Northern Europe among others have shown that it doesn t have to be all one or the other Each of these ideologies has good features and the trick is figuring out the best way to combine them Which is probably why I like the wishy washiness of the Liberal Party   there s room to pick and choose  Anyway earlier you listed a lot of areas you thought should be government run I think there is enough there that we should be able to make an algorithm to decide what goes where In my mind it is about natural monopolies If the public is best served by a  benign monopoly because of efficiency the network effect or whatever then government should be that monopoly because history has plenty of examples of what happens when industry runs it  The downside of monopolies is that they are not agile But for a lot of things that isn t a problem Roads and railways don t change much Nor do sewage pipes or health insurance policies  heck even car and house insurance  And one might argue that fibre optic links to the home would be pretty stable too though we could always competitively outsource the management of them and rent out bandwidth to agile service providers  The telephone system used to be a natural monopoly It was run by industry but heavily regulated to prevent abuse But then technology started changing faster than big companies could keep up and governments in the end rightly ended the monopolies where possible  it would have been even easier if government actually owned the telephone poles and wires  So it is possible to change when needed Ontario Hydro would be the counter example where I think we went too far  The social spectrum side is a harder one to crack I lean more to permissiveness  at least until I get about  years older on things that don t affect other people but I can appreciate the argument that we don t know where those things might lead down the road  Maybe this sort of thing is discussed in political science classes but it would be nice for it to be the common framework we use informally  edit another category you pointed out things that benefit society but are not monetarily lucrative 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you are going to do this you need to separate manufacturing from development China is the perfect example of this invent anywhere and produce in China If the idea is a money maker does it really matter who thought of it or where 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m for it  I believe there should be an option of the ultimate punishment for the most heinous of crimes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Read Bill Maher s op Ed in the NY times today reviewed here by glen beck nonetheless      There isn t a double standard you may just have selective memory 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree This is apparent in many parts of our society Not only do we still have the death penalty but we imprison more people than any other nation 
PoliticalDiscussion,It may be morbid but it s a valid point My masters thesis in econ was about the gains in the European labor market for skilled tradesmen due to   of the European population dying from the plague morbid but interesting 
PoliticalDiscussion,So how do they define  republican then  If they re just talking about the party candidates Paul obviously has to be included 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s worth a shot The key is that you have you be willing to pay people enough for them to come over from the private sector A major problem with financial reform is that the brightest minds in the world all work in the industry because it pays so well 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree I ve read about lethal injection and apparently they re paralyzed but completely aware and can feel themselves dying That is definitely the most cruel and medieval way to kill anyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m for the death penalty but I think it should be reserved for certain cases If someone is found guilty of murder but they plead innocent and there are no witnesses to the crime then I don t think capital punishment should be on the table   On the other hand if someone murders children and signs a written confession and admits to it in trial   string  em up I feel like there s a term for what I m describing but I can t put a finger on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am trying to highlight the point that men ought to be  and probably are  on the same side as women on this issue If those voices were heard too an anti contraception legislation would be clearly not a representation of any constituent  female or male  and the politicians would be exposed for what they are really trying to do i e pursue their own agenda It would be easier to vote them out of office The tone of the debate makes it seem like it is anti women only and a large number of male voters might not recognize that it is actually a matter of interest to them too  I don t mean to sound like men don t know what s best for them unless they are told But when new ideas are pitted against traditional ways of thinking it often helps to know that one s peers are open to changing the way they think If yesterday s man thought the pill was the woman s issue perhaps today s man could use a little help in thinking of it as an expense  they bear for the benefit of  their family partnership and hence he should protest alongside with her when she is attacked  The bigger picture for me is that passing judgement on contraception on religious grounds  intercourse without procreation or outside of wedlock is the same as telling people what they can or cannot to with their bodies  not a women s only issue If the government is participating in that kind of control over its people is it really a representative form of government Men  and women should be wary of the kind of politicians 
PoliticalDiscussion,And if they re willing to take that risk in my humble opinion that society is pretty freaking barbaric 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which makes me wonder morbidly would it be better or worse for Rand to run for president with his dad alive or dead  Alive he can rally the base dead he can much more plausibly distance himself    I am a terrible human being  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt As far as African genocides are concerned I m gonna have to disagree with you I don t think it is the job of any country to police the world To presume that we know what is best for the region is foolish By intervening you fundamentally change the political landscape of the area and that often has unintended sometimes long lasting negative consequences but who cares as long as they re a democracy now right  I m not talking about nation building or getting involved in relatively symmetric civil wars I m talking about when one group of people is being murdered by the tens or hundreds of thousands like Darfur or Rwanda 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re right on your overall point about the  evolutionary biological imperatives   Strictly speaking it benefits society for men to spread their seed if you will  However you lost me at   gt So it can t just be admitted that men and women like sex and dont intend to have kids everytime because that s a very recent invention  When was the orgy invented  Yeah 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bernie Madoff scale crashing the economy like the banks did or rampant profiteering like what s been happening with the pharmaceutical industry Basically anything that has a very high dollar figure  a million dollars or more  negatively affects the entire nation s economy and or causes poverty rates to significantly increase or costs people their lives by causing the price of necessities to skyrocket Lives welfare and national security depend on a healthy economy If one asshole puts their own greed before basic decency or the welfare of the nation then they should be shot Bankers would be a hell of a lot more reluctant to fuck everybody else over and send millions of people into poverty if they knew it could cost them their lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s interesting and I had no idea Greece tried stuff like this  What if we also try to make it as transparent as possible That kind of thing worked with the American Recovery Act We could possibly include the masses into these kinds of ideas as well It would get the right people involved  if we gave the populace of scientists and engineers an ability to influence these kinds of things by giving them to the tools to see what s going on and how they can play a part 
PoliticalDiscussion,if you don t think that bumper sticker is funny then you don t have a sense of humor
PoliticalDiscussion,There is always the possibility that these various compartmentalized functions will be subject to corruption Greece is a very good example of this They have a bureau of statistics which was formed in order to be a third party statistical insight into the functions of government As we can see this didn t work out When the Greek debt became publicly known as a problem the bureau cited the budget deficit as  of GDP The European Central Bank sent in a swiss statistician and his findings were that it was actually closer to  of GDP He also constantly reported that the bureau was so corrupt that he could barely get any work done   However there are some nations that this has worked Switzerland being a good example They re technocratic policies were the model behind the recent European Union budget reform measures   I don t know the answer is as to why it works in some places and why not in others China for example has created various  Special Economic Zones or SECs which specialize in different things Russia tried a similar policy and it failed miserably I think culture has a big influence on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be funny if Ron is the weird grandpa that rattles on and on about the blacks and gold and the government while everyone else awkwardly eats their turkey And he refers to them as  the blacks  I doubt it though He seems like a pretty calm guy

PoliticalDiscussion, The third link on the page of results you linked to  
PoliticalDiscussion,I wish I could be a fly on the wall at the Paul family Thanksgiving just to know what they re actually thinking  
PoliticalDiscussion,No because they were struggling for freedom from that tyranny Freedom mattered the most for those people 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think if you kill someone you should die too  I think that s the end point of your argument and you ve twisted and manipulated sources that clearly oppose the death penalty to justify the view you had before you started your research Quibbling over  emotional language on a page that lists concrete facts and statistics is unfair and fails to  see the forest for the trees  you re attacking the method of presentation rather than the facts presented  And as other posters have mentioned the correlation between the  s homicide rate and the expansion of capital punishment can not be said to be causative  All crime dipped in the s not just those punishable by death Correlation   causation   I oppose the death penalty because it s logical to do so I oppose the death penalty because it s cheaper to incarcerate for life there s no risk of wrongful execution psychopaths don t respond to deterrents other developed nations have outlawed capital punishment  and it makes us look like savages to use it  and because if we are to value life we can t pick and choose who lives and who dies  I think support for the death penalty comes out of some demented Bronze Age revenge impulse  An eye for an eye    and all that nonsense I think supporters of the death penalty take the stance that they do because if one of  their loved ones was murdered they would be unable to cope with that loss until the perpetrator was murdered in turn I think that all the specious arguments in favor of capital punishments are attempts to legitimize that impulse toward violence and I don t think that revenge is a value that we as a society should condone or permit  The application of the death penalty is one of those positions  along with opposition to gay marriage prayer in schools global warming denial and teaching intelligent design that proponents should admit is rooted in the way they  feel  rather than what is factual pragmatic and realistic It s a shame that individuals subjective sense of the way the world  should be is allowed to exist in the sphere of public debate along side arguments based on data research and observation 
PoliticalDiscussion,You gave a definition of freedom that was not incompatible with or all that different from mine  You did not explain how and individual or a corporation that is not using government in some manner hinders your freedom  All  questions still remain unanswered 
PoliticalDiscussion,Without freedom there is no life The two things are inextricable 
PoliticalDiscussion, Here it is  
PoliticalDiscussion,The concepts of modesty and restraint are lost on the relativist liberals who care more about hedonism than society and tradition This is one more battle like every battle that conservatives will lose Until society reaches its breaking point and a real crises arrives then the reactionaries will be forced to clean up the mess of the egalitarians and the libertines  Relax OP they ll get what they want they always do 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is never ANY good reason for capital punishment  It simply does not accomplish ANYTHING  The only reason to do it is for revenge and that is a terrible reason  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that s a very valid point A society has to ask itself if it is willing to risk killing an innocent person in order to maintain the death penalty as it will likely occur 
PoliticalDiscussion,Steven Levitt Ph D economist from the University of Chicago has attributed a large amount of the drop in crime post  to the legalization of abortion in  You can read a summary of his work in Freakonomics and the rest by googling his scholarly work on the subject   It s difficult to find scholarly work that suggests the death penalty is an effective deterrent One reason being what you cited these types of crimes are typically either per meditated which means they have considered the punishment and still choose to go forward with the crime or they are committed during a fit of rage or other extreme emotional situation where the repercussions are not considered  Overall and this is more subjective on my part I don t believe it is right or moral for a society to choose who dies and who does not It is a sign of a less than developed culture Let alone it being very costly and ineffective at reducing crime 
PoliticalDiscussion,Men don t have nearly the same stake in contraceptives as women If abortion is illegal it s not men who have to carry the baby or humiliate themselves asking for shady help or take a coat hanger or live with the experience for the rest of their lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,In your opinion how serious should the financial crimes be in order to warrant the death penalty 
PoliticalDiscussion,Huh  Are there many Libertarians that feel the same way   Are you OK with sensible environmental regulations too  We might be finding a whole continent of common ground here 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The national murder rate rose and stayed above the  rate for every year but  until  So perhaps the death penalty isn t a deterrent But the murder rate began to fall very sharply starting in   One of the  Freakanomics   authors suggests that  legalized abortion   is the operating influence driving the post drop in criminal activity including murder  This is is a disputed claim but clearly there was some more general social or demographic shift that accounts for a coordinated shift in the incidence rates of both capital and non capital crimes  It seems unlikely that expanding the death penalty would have an effect on would be criminals contemplating property crimes or non capital violent crimes  Sustained  low unemployment    look at the period from  to  for much of the s seems a good contender  Most honest appraisals of the death penalty conclude that it has negligible deterrent effect because it lacks three features of any effective deterrent system   Deterrence is distributed consistently to all offenders  Deterrence is closely coupled in time to the offense  Deterrence is observed regularly by the population that is likely to offend  Capital punishment fails miserably on all counts  It s given or withheld based on your race or socio economic status which engenders fatalism in minority communities  Punishment is frequently separated from offense by a decade or more  Unless you live in Texas executions occur so seldomly that they are on the bare periphery of the American consciousness  You cannot reasonably expect an effective deterrent effect without modifying the criminal justice system to what many would consider an abhorrent degree  Deterrence is therefore irrelevant to the argument  Justice and retribution are the arguments that remain  Justice is rarely served by penalties that cannot be taken back  in whole or in part if a conviction is handed down in error  When exculpatory evidence is produced with the regularity seen in the American system  due to revealed malfeasance on the part of police or prosecutors or dumb luck that follows bad luck or technological advancement  it s very hard to say that someone dead and buried and exonerated is well served by that system  I ll leave off the  state has no business killing people  though this is my personal belief as it represents just that and most arguments supporting it are syllogistic  You either believe it or you don t  Retribution remains the single strongest argument in favor of capital punishment but the one that proponents are the least enthusiastic to address as an honest argument  Curiously though it pervades most casual discussions of individual cases payback is a bitch  Retribution and reciprocity still sidesteps the basic issue of justice  Payback isn t a bitch if you didn t deserve it  payback for shit you never did is a violation of your rights  If that can never be taken back it matters very little how well suited it was to some hypothetical criminal behavior that never took place  You hear a lot of people retreat to the comfort zone of obvious guilt what if he admitted it he s judged to be sane and the police have a mountain of damning evidence  That s probably a circumstance where you could start to have an honest debate about justice but I have yet to see   anyone  suggest that admitted guilt be a prerequisite for the death penalty  It s generally a devil s advocate ploy to get the nose of the camel under the tent in an argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,That sounds very plausible particularly given the current  front runners for  Robio Christie etc I think he d be a very good choice for the Republicans given a Republican primary in  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think they did good setting it up in the first place  although I object to the lack of Constitutional authority for such things  but once the system was completed it should ve been turned over to the states   Building local extensions between suburbs has nothing to do with  interstate highways  even if the number is the same except  with a  stuck in front of it   And at this point the states could do a far better job on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes absolutely  Just look at the developing world over the past  years where globalization has really left its mark  While China and India are the best known examples Brazil and much of Latin America is also growing in leaps and bounds  And the truly unsung success story is Africa which has grown by around  over the past decade  Globalization has injected capital  and thus jobs into countries that had never had such access before  Hundreds of millions of new jobs have been created while living standards and life expectancy have drastically improved  At the same time the advent of modern communications technologies have forced those governments to become far more accountable to their people  Not doing so requires vast security apparatuses like in China and Iran or has resulted in those illegitimate regimes being toppled as in the Arab world over the past year  Furthermore the globalization has created great incentives for peace  Economies are now so interconnected that wars between great powers are likely a thing of the past  hence the rise in non state actors as combatants   In conclusion globalization ought to be praised for its successes and encouraged until it can accomplish its ultimate goals relative economic equality and living standards around the world world peace and a stable international system based on mutual economic gains  Globalization for peace 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But there is nothing wrong with pointing at the guy who says he wants to spread the wealth around and calling him a socialist communist  If A then B is not the same as if B then A Basically communism is a completely state run economy which not very many liberals advocate for In other words to be a communist you have to be left wing but if you re left wing it doesn t necessarily make you a communist This works for socialism as well though it s a little different Socialism is a spectrum and as soon as you re not hard right you re a little socialist But that s not how it used rhetorically in which socialism is synonymous with communism Other than that I agree with you agreeing with me     gt This is actual racism  Is satire the same thing as what the satire is about I mean I don t want to get too semantic here but actual racism is far different from a satire of racist people however ill conceived or true that it is The point of my calling it a false equivalency is that there is a very real problem of racism within conservatism It might not be as big as it s made out to be but I would bet any amount of money that racism is far more prevalent on the right than the left People doing a skit pointing this out have  good intentions  while racism doesn t Racism is not defined as actions it s defined as a belief    gt EDIT And if the school is such a racist hellhole why are these liberals auctioning off   worth of shit to support the school Fuck   my school bake sales wouldn t make more than  bucks not       agree and I can t explain it either And you made me laugh a bit so kudos   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt it happens far too often for any reasonable person to be comfortable with it  Personally I d say once is far too often The fact that the US government alone has made the wrong choice more than that is good enough for me to support ending it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Are you sure you re a Libertarian You made a pretty compelling argument for the Volcker Rule  I m a libertarian too I won t shed too many tears for financial regulation as long as it isn t of the sort that affects genuine enterpreneurship since banks in our modern world are not free market associations in any way shape or form The banks knew that they had a bailout safety net since the s and the  bailout   cemented it and now we re loaning them emergency liquidity at  for them to loan back to governments at   
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not a leftist but I appose the death penalty completely The government makes mistakes a lot of them leaving your very life in their hands is not something I m comfortable with Wrongful conviction  is murder and it happens far too often for any reasonable person to be comfortable with it To top it off most conservatives assume that it s cheaper to kill a person than to jail them for life as it happens this isn t even true It s actually far more expensive to kill a person through death row than to just let them rot in jail for life Finally as somebody else mentioned  almost all violent crimes have been on the decline not just  murder related ones

PoliticalDiscussion,I get what your saying about about the governments hand not being forced unless it s necessary for reelection but fighting terrorism is still widely seen as a good fight and people still consider terrorism a threat Public opinion will not be swayed from this in the near future as it is universally accepted as necessary by both political parties With the republicans moving further right and the democrats following them in an effort to look moderate this trend will not reverse itself  As far as African genocides are concerned I m gonna have to disagree with you I don t think it is the job of any country to police the world  To presume that we know what is best for the region is foolish By intervening you fundamentally change the political landscape of the area and that often has unintended sometimes long lasting negative consequences but who cares as long as they re a democracy now right   To start with We should only intervene in humanitarian crisis if it is in both our best interest and the best interest of the people of the region otherwise we become a major player in the region and that will only serve to create further conflict as it did in the middle east with our support of Israel At the time it looked like the best strategic option at the time with russia to the north and control of the suez in the balance But we failed to recognize the entire humanitarian reality of the conflict and as a result have simply been a cause of conflict in a region that we can t seem to end our involvement in which has caused problems for everyone involved The same thing happened when we armed the Afghani mujaheddin It seemed like a good way to fight the soviets but we didn t really care that the interests of at least some of the people we were giving guns to weren t exactly the local robin hoods and weren t our closest allies either  Onthe other hand the last time we intervened in a local conflict on purely humanitarian grounds was somalia in  and that ended up being a strategic disaster for us with black hawk down a year later It was a disaster for us and at best didn t do anything good for them It was after all the first of about  battles of Mogadishu that followed though I don t know if that can be blamed on us it certainly wasn t stopped by us as we intended Libya was really the perfect storm for foreign intervention because the people had revolted so we knew what we were doing was best for the people We were just joining in At the same time the existing regime was hostile to the US and he had a lot of oil so we weren t quite fucking ourselves either  But what about a situation like Liberia or Sierra Leon where there is no clear cut bad guy How can we know that what we are doing is what s best for the people of the country How can we know how this will end for us when we don t have any interest  You really can t just say we should intervene in every humanitarian crisis but you can t say we should ignore the either You have to judge them on a case by case basis You can t just plan on the good that comes from your intervention outweighing the bad Because if it creates a problem for either party involved it WILL create a problem for both in the long run 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand that there s been a drop in the overall crime rate since the mid  s not just capital crimes so clearly there are other factors at work    My own guess is that the types of crimes that typically get the death penalty are so horrific that the offender is probably well past thinking about long term self preservation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I always found equality overrated myself Isn t even  apples for A and  apples for B better than  apples for both 
PoliticalDiscussion,Freedom is superior not because everyone prefers it but because it allows the expression of a preference in the first place A Brave New World society can be created as an enclave within a free society but not the other way around

PoliticalDiscussion,There are two sides to the coin with respect to your quote So yes it could be that union members voted and supported Brown but the  general apathy in urban areas that are largely Democratic is equally as important That is Coakley didn t her base   I still feel strongly that the reason Obama lost the house in  was because the Republicans controlled the narrative and successfully painted him as the Big Government guy in the middle of a recession The Republican victory in  was due in large part to the Tea Party   I think a better political move would have been to go after Wall Street  hard  People were angry and they wanted to see blood I would go as far as to say there should not have been a bailout even if it would have deepened the recession

PoliticalDiscussion,I think yes My reasoning would be for the majority of people we do not spend our entire  hours  or whatever working Our concentration dips up and down  hours a week is a pretty substantial amount of time for people to be working particularly in a poor environment like an office  My reasoning would be we would work harder in the amount of time we were given achieving the same amount of work in a shorter time space We d be happier and less resentful of our work life in general  This certainly works for more project based work If you were in a customer service environment where you just have to serve people that come in etc I think the amount of work you do would be more or less the same although the quality may suffer

PoliticalDiscussion,This is something that doesn t directly relate to what you are trying to talk about but I feel like should be added as a starting point for any discussion on education in the U S In countries like UK France Japan Germany etc primary education is funded on a federal level Each student receives the same amount of tax money   In the U S  local property taxes account for the majority of primary school funding So you end up with a mismatch between ability and quality of education Whereas in other countries every student has access to the same resources we have inner city kids  some talented some useless who have access to very little resources and we have kids in high property tax areas  some talented some useless who have access to a very high amount of resources   One way to start correcting the system would be to pool the taxes at federal level and then distribute them evenly among every student It would a work wonders for the proper allocation of resources and ability resource matching and b  not a directly related point but one worth mentioning would stop the creation of culturally homogeneous youth in the most heterogeneous country in the world  
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t agree with the  hour workday  However I think we should be enforcing the law and sticking with the  hour work day  When you work people for more than  hours in one day you lose productivity  So you re compensating someone for diminishing returns  Those diminishing returns get worse if you work them OT and especially OT over a long period of time 
PoliticalDiscussion,This will seem like a bit of a non sequitur but I believe part of the solution is stronger advocacy for parental involvement Khan Academy has the right idea that teachers are beneficial as subject matter experts consultants   but does not extend the paradigm far enough   The model where kids  go to school to be  educated is inherently flawed If you want a high performing educational system then that system needs to be pervasive throughout a students life by default this means that parents need to shoulder most of the burden in getting their kids to make the leap from good to great 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s one of the most unpopular opinions I will ever express government is about forcing me and everyone else to do things we should be doing but don t want to do For example paying for roads schools prisons copyright protection research and development police and firefighters  Everyone hates the idea that they have to be forced to do things but society wouldn t work if we weren t The main service government provides is coercion society s load bearing rod  Take me for instance I fully understand that if I don t pay for the roads I use they ll gradually deteriorate to the point that it sucks to drive on them But I still wouldn t pay for road maintenance unless I was forced to because I m a shortsighted idiot And most people are roughly like me 
PoliticalDiscussion,The challenge in  shifting to a X hr work day is that the paradigm is based on an industrial economy framework This model assumes that workers are generally fungible  one healthy worker is as good as another  and thereby easily replaceable  on the line   Under this paradigm there is an optimum level of productivity to be gained by having an employee work before someone else takes over the role   The modern economy doesn t work like this At all  A knowledge worker s productivity is not time dependent in the same manner of an assembly line worker The majority of people are therefore not being paid  by the hour but rather  by the job  a job being delivery of a piece of work in a set period of time    So by setting an arbitrary time limit on the workday  hrs hrs or hrs you are introducing ineffeciencies in the economy and trying to move it back to an industrial model of production  Practically what this means is that you lose your competitive ability with other non managed economies and generally achieve the standard of living associated with industrial economies 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am  theoretically voting for the  Muslim  But anyone who s dumb enough to believe that Obama is a Muslim will already be voting for the Mormon 
PoliticalDiscussion,I always think France and UK are much better comparisons to the US in terms of economics then Norway or Sweden Both are much bigger  France and UK are both around million people versus  for Sweden and  for Norway France and the UK are also much more diverse But since France and the UK aren t totally awesome paradises no one talks about them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you kidding Mormon All the way mormon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Some historical context is needed here  Eisenhower aligned himself with a faction of the Republican Party that was relatively new when he took office the  let s quit fighting the New Deal faction Republicans had spent much of the s attacking the New Deal in much the same way that they attack Obama s programs now   they dismissed the New Deal as  class warfare and  socialism   Though with the added wrinkle that FDR himself was a wealthy privileged New Yorker they often took to calling him a  class traitor as well   By the middle of the decade the GOP had split one group still bitterly opposed the New Deal while another insisted that Republicans could run New Deal programs better and more efficiently than the Roosevelt administration Roosevelt s next two opponents   both of whom he defeated and one of whom Alf Landon he defeated in the biggest landslide in US history   to varying extents opposed the New Deal Thomas Dewey a pro New Deal Republican represented the party against both Roosevelt and Truman losing both times but profoundly influencing the GOP s outlook   Looking for a fresh face the GOP enlisted respected war hero Eisenhower who gravitated toward Dewey s pro New Deal wing of the Party and won handily in two elections  Think of the situation as somewhat analogous   somewhat  to the  New Democrats led by Bill Clinton in the s   after losing catastrophically with more ideologically rigid candidates the Democrats embraced a more pragmatic centrist candidate who led them to electoral victory 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox News will tell them to vote for the Mormon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Never underestimate capitalist forces especially when a countries government is completely servile to them

PoliticalDiscussion,Yes calling someone out for being inaccurate    how uncalled for    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There appears to be a growing consensus in statistical results that the death penalty has a relatively robust deterrent effect  If you read the entire article the studies cited have been criticized by other academics for potential flaws in methodology Statistical analyses of rare events are very difficult business so  growing consensus is not the language that I would use at this point  Nonetheless thanks for sharing the link  it s certainly relevant information 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Even if removed completely it could be added back the next time they do an NDAA by a different president and the same or different congress Obama can t sign something into law that has to be obeyed by the guy after him that s not how this works  If he had demanded it be removed before he signed it it would have to go through the whole process again to make it law  The way it is now the next president  or like I said even this president could sign another directive saying that they will enforce this part of NDAA   gt The NDAA didn t  give him the power to do that all it did was codify something they ve been doing for years that s why it was in this piece of legislature to begin with  I keep seeing this argument like this somehow makes it ok      gt It doesn t matter how much you hate Obama what he did was the only way to reduce that from happening for the next  hopefully  years  Not true  He could have vetoed the entire thing  And yes I do hate Obama because he s exactly the same as Bush Romney McCain etc with a different letter next to his name  He s a neo con whether you like it or not

PoliticalDiscussion, gt First of all those are examples of bureaucracy not socialism  No  socialism is collective ownership or control of the means of production    Bureaucracy is simply a consequence of socialism    gt In the examples you just mentioned a capitalist government    Capitalism is private ownership or control of the means of production    Hence there is no such thing as a  capitalist government    Either learn the definitions of the terms you are using or go back to r politics where you belong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because being a comedian requires having some wit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends Are you writing this post from work If so then yes  D  On a somewhat more serious note I think it s obvious that people waste a ton of time at work Pretty much everyone is guilty of it However the idea of  work may be changing a bit with this whole internet thing More people work from home and are bound by project deadlines instead of workdays Now for the guy bolting together car parts  do we still do that in the US   or the guy making window frames then these people obviously have different constraints But I don t see why they couldn t be put on a quota system for daily work instead of just saying  you must be here for  hours  two of which will be spent doddling around  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re probably right I wish they d do it at my job   
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  I d get far more satisfaction out of watching someone rot in jail or be rehabilitated and form part of a normal society again  Killing the murderer won t bring my loved one back 
PoliticalDiscussion,In terms of evolution it is advantageous to both men and women not to be monogamous If two different guys come inside a girl their sperm will actually fight and the strongest sperm will win But if we are going by the theory of evolutionary benefits then it would actually be beneficial to men as well to screw as many women as possible to increase the chances of contraception We humans have a certain proclivity to thinking that we are somehow special and different than the animal kingdom When really from an evolutionary perspective we should be having sex with as many women as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  I feel like there s a term for what I m describing but I can t put a finger on it  Revenge is the word you re looking for  Even in your hypothetical  someone murders children and signs a written confession and admits to it in trial there is still a chance that the person could be lying mentally unstable or covering for someone else  It s why convictions are  beyond all probable doubt and not absolute 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is all about men The thing that most men fail to realize is that women have been and still are  in some places treated as second class citizens because of their gender The component in the equation is that men have used their power and influence to control and subjugate women for literally thousands of years Many of our grandparents grew up in a time when a woman s sole role was to make babies and look after the house  and I don t have any problem with the women who choose to do that  however if there is an institutionalized external force which prevents them from getting an education or driving a car or voting then this is something that pisses off a lot of women for some reason   We re in the baby steps part of women s equality right now Only  years ago it was considered wild for a woman to have sex in anything other than the missionary position A hundred years ago Emma Goldman was arrested for speaking to women about how to not get pregnant by timing sex with their menstrual cycles  she subsequently started telling them the same information in their own languages instead of English so the police wouldn t know what she was saying Which is pretty badass  In fact just a hundred years ago it used to be considered absolutely normal to marry and knock up a  to  year old By the time she was  she should have at least  kids So yes things have changed dramatically in the last century So when senators want to limit access to birth control or force them to get vaginal probes and look at ultrasounds of their fetuses or call them sluts for wishing that their healthcare plans cover contraception  while Viagra is still covered for men then this pisses them off and is a reminder of the past oppression that women had to endure even in the US Of course if we look at countries like Saudi Arabia women aren t even allowed to show their faces in public and have to walk  steps behind a man If she is raped the punishment is that she is killed for being unpure So we still have a long way to go but there will always be people like Rush who wish to drag us back to the beginning of the th century in terms of women s rights and there are still loads of people who agree with him   So men aren t missing from the equation They created the entire equation to begin with 
PoliticalDiscussion,Comparing situations where the DP is more or less effectively or extensively applied is not nearly as important as comparing it to places where there is a DP and where there is not Changes in application could also be applied to cutting of hands or noses If they were done more extensively they may have more of a deterring effect but that doesn t mean it s altogether a good approach By fixating on the DP without understanding the mentality from which it issues and the overall approach to justice one eclipses the overall justice approach altogether 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anybody who was knowingly involved and understood what could happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,This sounds good but I don t understand how this is supposed to work for working class people If you re working  hours a week and barely making  a month on minimum wage already then they cut  hours of that out   what are you suggesting exactly Should we raise minimum wage to make up for the cut in hours Or is this just a suggestion for people on salary 
PoliticalDiscussion,Used for nothing at all  You must be kidding   Constitutional No it isn t but that doesn t matter Obama continued Bush II s policies regarding warrantless wiretapping and the Patriot Act    Federal Judge Finds Warrantless Wiretaps Illegal  
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree with the Death Penalty the fact is that no matter how you enforce it there will be mistakes made in fact there have been  mistakes made since    and this shouldn t happen if it does then they shouldn t have the Death Penalty  Capital Punishment isn t any cheaper than life in prison but America has had more people executed on Capital Punishment than any other country including the Middle East and China 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends what sort of environmental harm we re talking about For localized damage strong property rights are good enough while for issues that can t practically be solved that way like pollution I would actually be happy with a carbon tax especially if it replaces rather than adds to existing ones  as the slogan goes  tax bads not goods    
PoliticalDiscussion,Many other country s parole much earlier than America who often makes them serve out all of the sentence I would suggest you also have a much more conservative government  Yes even the Democrats who always tend towards a strong justice system for punishment rather than the norm nowadays of being a reform and re education system for prisoners  I think crime rate in America is also higher than in most places which would also account for this 
PoliticalDiscussion, Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national  war on drugs  The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since  In   percent of those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges   link  
PoliticalDiscussion,FAUX is not a legitimate news business they are a bought and paid for Republican propaganda machine  of what they spew is factually incorrect You may not like MSNBC but from a factual perspective you can t challenge the information they provide   It was proven recently that FAUX viewers were less likely to know the correct answer to a question than someone who watches NO news 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it would help keep employees happier and healthier It would also justify employers in demanding a higher degree of focus and efficiency from their employees This might not work for every industry but some would benefit 
PoliticalDiscussion,France has a  hour workweek  I say we go for  hours and make two people necessary for every job 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think you get it The problem isn t that he s breaking the rules he is clearly following the rules to the T The problem is that the rules that are being taken advantage of are undemocratic He is subverting the will of the people by stealing the delegates away from the candidates that the People expected them to support What is the point of having a representative democracy if the representatives are only representing  themselves   What he is doing is blatantly ignoring the voice of the People They do  not want him to be their nominee and he doesn t give a shit They say you can tell a lot about a candidate by the way he runs for office and what I am seeing right now does not bode well for his presidency He doesn t care about the People Only his ideology 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is wishful thinking at  best    First off just like what happened in  a conservative independent will enter the race and the conservative vote will be split in half Secondly without his own party to back him up  keep in mind that he hasn t won a single fucking state and has a laughable  ballot support the entire Republican party will implode spectacularly Lastly with the economy on the upswing Obama is going to win no matter who gets the nomination  Add to that fact that Ron Paul is not supported by any of the wealthy players in the election and is facing a heavily biased media industrial complex coupled with the fact that he is way too far outside the Overton Window to even hope to garner support and you have a one way ticket to disaster The best he can hope for is to spread his message and then have his son run in a couple of years 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it isn t The Republican party has a system set up with set rules that allocate delegates in a certain way some from elections and some from other sources  As long as he obeys the rules there s no problem  As for democracy the system is already extremely democratic  In every other country on earth there are no primary elections the party simply decides who runs then people get to vote for that person or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because liberalism is the default  It s a hell of a lot safer to do political jokes about GWB than Barrack obama so conservative comedians learn to keep their mouth shut 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh they re no less guilty They would however be more statistically likely to murder because of their social environment  My point is it kind of sucks for them They had no choice what family they were born into the place they ll be born And where they reside would obviously have a massive impact on who your peers are which in turn effects behaviour See what I m getting at 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problems with the death penalty could be solved if it was used more  Racial disparities and cost issues would disappear if it was applied more consistently Also the variety of crimes for which one is eligible needs to be expanded beyond murder and treason  Guys like Bernie Madoff should hang 
PoliticalDiscussion,This would be dope 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let me play a little devil s advocate here   Why would a company   want  to do this  Ethically it makes more sense But when the primary motive of pretty much every business ever is to make a profit why in shit would this be good for them  This is obviously from their point of view IMO when profit is the main objective of businesses and industries it severely slows down social progress and innovation  EDIT also reducing the work load of employees in the hope that it gives your economy a kick start by hoping that it increases consumption is a  huge gamble 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right he inherited a problem I agree but both deficit and debt have been increased significantly And as far as I can find the bailouts have not been paid back in full  I think like  of bailout money has been paid  I just feel that spending across the board is too much And I don t agree with the government choosing which companies succeed and which ones don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,It still doesn t sit well with me that you feel no remorse for their death  If it came down to that hypothetical I would rather them paying total damages in return and then some and then to be ostracized Let s bring it back to Classical Greek times yo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatism tends to appeal to older poorer audiences Advertisers want to capture younger wealthier audiences This clash between what advertisers want and what conservatism appeals to means that advertisers are not likely to sponsor conservative comedians As such you aren t going to have very many conservative comedians on advertising based mediums  That means they re mostly confined to AM radio and donation funded groups Make sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,and if Ron Paul wins the Primary he ll win a plurality in the General 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is obtaining the consent of the governed really so much to ask  That s how democracy is supposed to work In order for your government to be legitimate it must have the consent of the governed Ron Paul hasn t won a  single state and has the smallest number of votes among all the candidates If anyone doesn t deserve the nomination it is him The people clearly have rejected him 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am for a death penaltyunder certain circumstances Not because it is a deterrent  it isn t  or as retribution  for that is just revenge justified  but as protection  If someone has done something so heinous that it should never be allowed the chance to repeat it then as a protection for anyone else execution Some states  my own Minnesota for instance  prefer life imprisonment which is okay but expensive to protect other prisoners from reoffense or escape 
PoliticalDiscussion,So are you saying that you have to win a plurality of the votes in the general AND a plurality of the votes from a major party to not have a  stolen election  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s dishonest to tell people to vote for you when you have no intention of winning imho 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly We should be employing more people to do less work in less of their time so they can spend more time buying stuff and spending time with their families It seems like a win all around 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah that s what I think at least That would drive local economic activity which is great for community building 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but they get  weeks of paid vacation per year mandated by the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about question marks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes exactly With the death penalty we might accidentally kill the wrong person And for what So we get to kill murderers  Why is it so important to kill murderers that it s worth accidentally killing people who aren t murderers 
PoliticalDiscussion,You need to get a glimpse of a worldview other than the one we got handed down by the puritans   In most societies sex is not so much a moral issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s get back to an  hour workday first ok 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t understand why there would be an increase in economic activity Is it because everyone will spend their extra non work hour buying things 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So how do they define  republican then  Ones that Rush Limbaugh would call  real Republicans   
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve been saying for years if they could just knock a little time off of  full time work those hours could go to more jobs for people that aren t lucky enough to have a job 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which unfortunately doesn t account for the wealth they reap from natural resources of which they have a ton in the form of oil and fish I d be more interested in productivity per hour of office workers or some other more comparable industry 
PoliticalDiscussion,  hour days always worked really well for me  day weekends 
PoliticalDiscussion,First of all those are examples of bureaucracy not socialism The difference between capitalism and socialism would be in the response a government takes towards the aspects of income inequality like the ones you just mentioned   In the examples you just mentioned a capitalist government responds that the unfairness in access to jobs cars and social security are acceptable because the free market is inherently unfair by design A socialist government responds by providing access specifically to the less fortunate as a way to  even the playing field  So to the extent that the US government provides special access to provisions for job competition driving housing and sustenance it is socialist which is to say at best it is somewhere in the middle  Now then when the rich and corporations are losing money as they were at the beginning of the recession for example the bank bailout the government steps in by providing access to resources that allow them to stay rich This is socialism for the rich 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt i m not gonna go in and fix my run on sentences no apologies  Fuk Yah   ubpote
PoliticalDiscussion,By releasing criminals early on license 
PoliticalDiscussion,The author of the law has already said it shouldn t cover Zimmerman Now stop being a dick 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sigh no  You cannot centrally plan economies well it is  literally impossible   to collect enough data and even if you could collect it you could never process it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unpopular opinion here but I support the death penalty There appears to be a growing consensus in statistical results that the death penalty has a relatively robust deterrent effect on murders Even if the government gets it wrong once in a while the innocent lives saved by the deterrent effect drastically outnumber the number of innocents killed   this article describes and gives the authors to look for about several different studies   I ve read them all and determined the evidence is solid too lazy to look them all up now though     
PoliticalDiscussion,Wrongful convictions aside  which aren t that common  I d prefer to see the death penalty become a smoother more efficient process The fact that keeping people locked up forever is often less expensive is silly express lane it up I d also like to see it expanded to include pedophiles and violent rapists  not including booze fueled  date rapes  at the behest of the families affected these individuals can t be  fixed  
PoliticalDiscussion,Although I m generally pretty conservative I wholeheartedly oppose the death penalty for one simple reason  I    personally    am not willing to administer the punishment    As a thought experiment what if the executioner were chosen at random from voter records just as jurors are  How would you feel if you were chosen to be the one to give the injection flip the switch whatever  Unless you would be able to do it without remorse then IMO it s hypocritical to ask it of a government official Just my two cents 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well okay maybe not a recent invention Men have always had sex for pleasure It s a recent invention for men  and women to have sex for mutual pleasure At least casually and widespread   But orgies were religious rites and they were constantly repressed   But I take your point people have always had sex for pleasure at one time or another but it s never really been societally accepted 
PoliticalDiscussion,So for the banks who exactly would you execute Just the CEO or the board of executives or all top level employees 
PoliticalDiscussion,Men definitely need to realise it And I think they are the response to Limbaughs Slut rant wasnt just from women But my point is more it s similar to racism not all of it is malice most is just plain ignorance The default position of most people is ignorance and fear of change   So it needs to be worked at Explaining to men and women how it hurts them all that will help These slut walks help etc etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,A similar paper might be written about gains in the American labor market for well everyone due to X of the European population industry dying from WW 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right I think certain industries here could operate better with shorter workdays and a much greater emphasis on focused work I believe European work styles are less tolerant of distractions like social networking and blog reading 
PoliticalDiscussion,Provide collective benefits protections that individuals free markets are unable to provide 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul doesn t have an election strategy He has a fund rasing strategy Just keep an eye on where that money goes after the convention 
PoliticalDiscussion,not true life is the bio mechanical function of your body in relation with your brain  freedom is merely a social aspect of life and may i add a human invention
PoliticalDiscussion,As a data point norway has the highest gdp per hour of work
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think we could shift to an   hour workday The actual average workweek for full time employees is already over  and then there are a lot of unreported hours being worked that people don t put on their time sheets I think it will get even worse before it gets better 
PoliticalDiscussion,We disagree 
PoliticalDiscussion,You haven t refuted shit Since he is so willing to cast aside his supposed convictions in order to obtain the nomination I severely doubt he will  Even if he intends to he wouldn t have the power 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re repeating statements I ve refuted  When Ron Paul wins it will result in less imposition on the masses 
PoliticalDiscussion,He is wrenching away the indirect control of the People so that his supporters can get what they want This is no different than an oligarchy he is imposing the will of his supporters  A small minority on the masses Whether he is following the rules or not is irrelevant The fact remains that what he is doing goes against the roots of our nation  It s sad to see how little Ron Paul and his supporters care about the will of the People In that respect Ron Paul is no different than George W Bush If his plan is successful you ll find me in the streets protesting this sham of an election I regret the sixty dollars I donated to this abominable campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,My peak productivity occurs between an hour after I enter the office and two hours prior to leaving the office Those three other hours I get nothing done and no I m not in meetings or doing anything of importance 
PoliticalDiscussion,You support it as a deterrent even though there s no evidence it does that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Youre basically saying  elite agendas that everyone knows about exist because we know about them but elite agendas that nobody knows about dont exist because nobody knows about them   If you dont see the flaw in your logic you are just as deluded as conspiracy nuts 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are plenty of funny conservatives but they re not really comedians  We call them clowns 
PoliticalDiscussion,Such is mainstream American public political discourse 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a good idea but I have no idea how that would work politically in the US I can imagine the number of parents going apeshit being worried that their children were being educated by communists 
PoliticalDiscussion,I tried contacting the mods about him as well and received no response    was really hoping they could step in and do something about him 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe you can be both  I am Chilean naturalized US citizen and I can tell you that Hispanics have much or more racism than the south US  I worked in Mexico and the darker your skin the more racism I observed Minorities can hate each other and have a sense of entitlement based on skin color as much as any racist of Anglo Saxon origin 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You simply can t have it both ways here  It s funny because  you are the one who is trying to have it both ways You want a liberal to be able to dress up in black face and make a bunch of racist jokes  and you don t want to call the action or the jokes racist   gt But something can t be racist and anti racist at the exact same time it s completely contradictory  That s because it wasn t anti racist It was simply anti conservative You have this mindset that liberals can t possibly be racist   It s quite humorous that you believe that 
PoliticalDiscussion,i never said life trumps freedom i merely stated the fact that life is on a much higher priority for our existence than the social aspects of that said existence  if i was a slave obviously i would fight for freedom that doesnt mean i would kill myself in order to free myself from slavery there is a word for that kind of man
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it s definitely your prerogative to think that but whenever dealing with accusations and allegations of racism  or sexism or any other type of ism  context means a lot You have to look at people s intentions and what they hope to accomplish with them Let s take what you said here as an example You said   gt I think the guy in blackface holding a giant stuffed ape meant to disparage black people  Which is fair enough  except    you also said this   gt the only apparent reason a white man dressed in blackface and caveman garb holding a giant stuffed ape was present was to bash the conservatives at the school  Not to get overly anal about this but if the reason for it was to bash conservatives for  being racist then it most certainly wasn t meant to disparage black people  it was meant to disparage those who actually  do disparage black people however incorrect it might be You simply can t have it both ways here It can t be a statement about how conservatives are lambasted as being racist  and have it actually be racist as well Insensitive Perhaps Crap Most certainly A disheartening statement on the reality of our political climate right now Oh God yes But something can t be racist and anti racist at the exact same time it s completely contradictory 
PoliticalDiscussion,By campaigning for Santorum early on And if Romney wins the nomination then Romney chooses an equally insane christian fundie as his running mate Plus a lot of Mormons are very far to the right After all is was basically the Mormon Church which poured millions into California in an attempt to block same sex marriage laws The religious right thinks this is cool so I don t think they really care whether or not Romney wears magic underwear believes that native americans are the lost tribe of Israel and that the garden of Eden is located outside of St Louis 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because you have to have an audience to be a successful comedian   the best comedians are the ones who tell the truth IMO like Bill Hicks or George Carlin  Modern conservatism is shrouded in lies so it would be very hard to make that funny 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a cultural thing  Our culture largely devalues things like science 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would be interested to learn how involved parents are in the EU to add some more fuel to this idea  I know that the involvement from my parents in my K journey through the California public education system played a huge part in my educational success so it makes sense that this could be a large factor in overall success but there s definitely a lot more factors to consider as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure  Companies would simply reduce people s pay rate by   to pay for the  hours of overtime and continue to work them for  hours

PoliticalDiscussion, gt    direct democracy    You ve just moved the bar Still a democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Unless you think that they meant to disparage black people by what they did then it wasn t racist  Yes I think the guy in blackface holding a giant stuffed ape meant to disparage black people  
PoliticalDiscussion,Since we re breaking up countries into separate ones the western provinces  except for BC which would be in Cascadia can all fuck off and join the American Midwest in whatever it becomes New England can join with Atlantic Canada Quebec and Ontario 
PoliticalDiscussion,That explains why I get downvoted into the ground whenever I mention Ben  Ctrl P Bernanke and Paul  Nobel Prize Krugman Professional Blogger 
PoliticalDiscussion,So what matters politically to you more than freedom is life Freedom is not worth your life so if you find yourself a slave then you would not risk your life to change that situation There is a word for that kind of man 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because comedy is really an art form To be good at it you need to be able to understand how others are feeling Which means you need to empathetic Which means you re not a conservative 
PoliticalDiscussion,    And the thing was the balance of payments for that fiscal year was wholly dependent on currency valuation so in real terms GDP growth was marginal at best    So that s why your parents lost their jobs Timmy   
PoliticalDiscussion,FYI This federation  united states of America has about  countries   
PoliticalDiscussion,Because laws that apply to the Federal Government automatically apply to the individual as well That don t make no sense  People should be able to vote no matter what their beliefs are That s what a democracy is  I think people like  this   are incredibly misguided but should they be barred from voting

PoliticalDiscussion,It s even worse than that  According to the  map you linked   mejn election  countycartpurple png   Blue states are actually cities    Take Illinois   of its population lives in Cook county that s why it s a blue state    Wisconsin is blue because of Madison Milwaukee and Green Bay  Michigan is blue because of Detroit Grand Rapids Ann Arbor and Lansing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You always hear people saying  if you don t like the way the country is run leave   Why would I leave my country when these people have already fucked it up so much We can cooperate or fight You re choice 
PoliticalDiscussion,lol okay those are some great definitions and ad hominem attacks but you forgot to mention how your examples of  a occupation licensing to joblessness among the poor  b emissons and car registration among the poor and  c social security among the poor are problems  exclusive to a socialist perspective on government With the exception of  c  to me those sounds like problems with any government of complex size   You see to institute a free market you can t just drop all the walls and remove government That s a misconception Let s discuss   A completely unregulated free market allows for private and corporate interests to buy up  or destroy enough competition so that there is no longer any competition Remember robber barons and carpet baggers Remember military juntas in South America Remember the full strength of the Italian Mafia Probably not because you like me are not  years old  What is a commonly held belief among modern economists is that the assumption of morality posited by    all   economic models is flawed so any system of government of a a large enough size needs to create rules regulations and laws Capitalism still has to find a solution to prevent collusion coercion and misdirection  or excessive force from any bad apples Police departments fire departments and economic institutions  regulatory agencies are therefore still necessary for a free market system to work efficiently   As I said in my prior post how a government responds to the inequities of the lower class is the distinction between socialist and libertarian policy Socialists care that inequity exists and try to find ways to create smart laws to correct for them libertarians do not care that inequity exists and see any intervention as excessive and unnecessary market intervention  Hopefully that makes things clear Always willing to discuss Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,there is a clear difference between the human experience and life if the question was  is freedom more important than the human experience  than i would agree with your statement that without freedom there is no human experience that they are inextricable  however life is something completely different something perfect compared to freedom which is something constructed thus inherently imperfect
PoliticalDiscussion,Walmart does this already  They schedule their workers for not quite full time and hire more and it even comes out cheaper because they don t have to pay benefits to as many people 
PoliticalDiscussion,There shouldn t be a government In theory there s nothing the state does that couldn t be done more efficiently and less violently by competing private businesses and nonprofits 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank Fox s misinformation   propaganda It s succeeded 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good point about the frontier The presence of the frontier as a sort of safety valve really shaped American culture The frontier technically disappeared in the s but I think it would help us in a lot of ways if a new  frontier could open up Maybe the rest of the solar system in  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,One thing I have noticed  and I have no data to support this it s just my intuition is that most nations with extremely successful educational programs by they Finnish or Korean or Japanese or Indian are all highly centralized programs that are run at the national level The system is planned out by the national government and it s more or less implemented the same throughout the nation Meanwhile the American system of education is highly federal there is almost no centralized control of the educational system 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is what State government is for Except no one ever pays attention to state level politics Obviously people don t care THAT much 
PoliticalDiscussion,Believe me I feel your frustration with the way our partisan system works but breaking up the country creates a lot of new problems without changing the way people actually think 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was commenting on his picture of California Oregon and Washington as one group Vancouver Canada can come too if they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,They vote for the Mormon all day erryday He isn t the one passing  socialist health care laws and trying to raise taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not  necessarily  
PoliticalDiscussion,Few Americans have the reading comprehension skills to understand the constitution  Try posting a transcript from SportsCenter instead 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty sure about  of Democrats think Obama is a Muslim So yeah Awkward 
PoliticalDiscussion,They are called states 
PoliticalDiscussion,The west cost actually becomes Cascadia 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you mean There are plenty of conservative comedians They just don t know they re comedians 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree However there are some draw backs to a solely republican democrat state It may be easier to travel to a state that you prefer but there will always be someone who cannot afford the transition and thus it would be  wrong to force them to endure a state that is purely one way   Now having many states under the same union could entice innovation as each state would be competing for a bigger population  tax reasons economy growth etc so we could see progress in that sense   I m just brain storming pros cons 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately you have a lot of valid points Too much of our current style of government relies on us being a giant country for us to just simply  break it up  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Is satire the same thing as what the satire is about  Satire is the modern liberal progressive democrat s excuse for everything since I can t remember when    It s only satire It s just a Parody  I find that as cowardly as can be   gt The point of my calling it a false equivalency is that there is a very real problem of racism within conservatism   There is no more racism in conservatism than there is racism in liberalism For every conservative out there who hates someone because of the color of their skin there is an equal number of liberals who feel the same   gt It might not be as big as it s made out to be but I would bet any amount of money that racism is far more prevalent on the right than the left  Really Do you evidence that by the  of whites who vote conservative Did you take a poll or something I assume you believe only white people are racist     gt People doing a skit pointing this out have good intentions  It s a real stretch to say there was any good intension behind dressing up in black face so you can make  republicans are racist jokes In the internet world we call that building a strawman and trolling     gt Racism is not defined as actions it s defined as a belief   I ll have to disagree with you there Racism is most certainly defined as actions taken as well as beliefs  
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that the current bipartisan political system is broken but I don t think that breaking up the country would result in a net reduction of problems  For one thing you d still need to have some level of  American Union government and breaking up the country would make the red and blue areas even more polarized than they are now  Looking at the problem from a different angle breaking up the country would hugely damage the economy The states are highly interdependent for example most of the big cities are in blue states and most of the food production is in red states   Also we have a lot of government components that are built around an entity that s continental sized with  million people The national pools for Social Security and Medicare wouldn t work very well if you broke up those systems into  or  pieces   Then there s the whole military angle   where are bases assets located and how much would keep working if you broke up the system 
PoliticalDiscussion,Now you ve proven that you re either a liar or stupid Plus you re projecting again   My arguments were clearly stated   Calling you intentionally dishonest is not an attack because  John Boehner spoke on behalf of his colleagues in the Republican Party and you are intellectually dishonest for ignoring this   The Health Care Reform Act furthered the stated goals of fiscal conservatives  Obama compromised on Health Care Reform among other things  So if you claim that I didn t make an argument then you are either lying or stupid QED 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah yes  this idea  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Based just on geography one problem you d have is that there s no version of the map where the blue states are all contiguous  you d have blue states surrounded by red permanently under siege so to speak  That s actually part of the goal These  countries shouldn t oppose each other but rather coexist separately Having them sprinkled around the country ensures that no matter where you live you can move just a few states away into the government you prefer 
PoliticalDiscussion,For reference   Red Blue Purple Map map of the United States based on current U S Senate membership    purple states have  Democrat and  Republican Senator   Map of Red and Blue States based on the Electoral College Results in the  Presidential election     More complicated Red Blue map  cartograms     mejn election   they include maps distorted in various ways to reflect population density and other factors  Based just on geography one problem you d have is that there s no version of the map where the blue states are all contiguous  you d have blue states surrounded by red permanently under siege so to speak 
PoliticalDiscussion,You looking to hire       LOL    Nice setup you have  Actually I can work from home  when needed  which can be  times a month  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because Liberals can t take a joke  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why don t we let employers and employees decide how many hours they want to work  Yeesh 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m definitely not a Republican but I m so tired of this being made into a partisan issue It seems most people  except complete asswipes are appalled by what happened  Republicans included  Yes the GOP favors guns probably more than Democrats do and it seems like the NRA is heavily Republican but THIS specific case  this kid s murderer being free  is a result of a shitty person using a poorly written law to get away and a shitty police department giving him a free pass  The whole thing is bullshit and disgusting but this is an issue  a case  that needs to stop being politicized Let s deal with Zimmerman and the shitty police work first and get into the politics of the situation later The guy hasn t even been arrested for crying out loud and that s the biggest injustice we need to deal with first 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that would be an interesting alternative as well Mostly I just feel that the bipartisan system is a broken system for the size of our country and that something needs to be done to change it rather than the  Hey everyone we re going to be conservative for the next four years Everybody hop on board  way it is now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure if trolling or not but he wouldn t be a very good Muslim then for denying his faith 
PoliticalDiscussion,My grandparents are Muslim and they believe that Obama is secretely a Muslim who is afraid to tell the country  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because show business is owned and run by liberals There is a code and they all want a seat at the cool table more than anything else   The most successful comedy tour of all time is the blue collar comedy tour If comedy club owners tv networks movie producers etc were working strictly for the money they would capitalize on the success of the four rednecks and there would be dozens of these types of comedians The fact that there are only four means that these owners are working on some basis other than monetary success and their own self interest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because most conservatives are too busy looking at Obama s Birth Certificate to have any sense of humor   Give them a break they have big choices to make either Obama is a radical Christian  Rev Wright or a Radical Muslim sent here to over through America from the inside   Decisions decisions  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why not take it one step further Have each state individually governed That way representation is even higher and it s even easier to move around I m guessing that is your goal to have a situation where there are many living alternatives and also keeping a high level of representation in the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Either that or conservatives haven t figured out the art of a self deprecating sense of humor It s hard to poke fun at ones self when so much time and effort is put forth not appearing to fall of the high horse 
PoliticalDiscussion,This Under current circumstances the U S would never allow secession If you are getting into hypothetical futures there would be too many variables to take into accuount  As I m sure you know back in the olden days the different states practically considered themselves different countries The differences  and preference for moving was more based on the resources jobs and land available though rather than different laws  or so I tell people    Also we had the frontier going for awhile So if you weren t satisfied with what you had or where you were you could pack your shit and try your luck out on the frontier Part of the original  American dream  the freedom to drop everything and try it out on your own  and everyone could find land   
PoliticalDiscussion,Government should do the least possible Whatever people can do for themselves should be left for them to do Most things can and should be accomplished through voluntary cooperation Three important functions cannot     Defense against foreign invaders An individual cannot defend themselves against a group force     Police  The use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision of another Therefore When a man is a victim of a criminal when his rights are violated the use of retaliatory force must be delegated by proxy to government an organized force that is bound by due process and the scope of object law     Courts  The punishment for crimes cannot be left to a market or a profit motive Contract disputes must have a final arbiter  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes essentially they would have to set their  countries permanently at the beginning They would however still belong as a part of a bigger whole much like the European Union The  American Union if you will 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clarify Are you suggesting dividing the states into three permanent separate countries or would states potentially change which  country they belonged to with every election cycle 
PoliticalDiscussion,It wouldn t work because the federal government would not be willing to give up its power  The last time something like that was attempted there was a Civil War  There might be other problems but most likely they could be worked around  The federal government is the big thing that ensures that this will never happen at least not any time soon 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Actors within a polycentric system would actually have those incentives  I don t see it Not only that but I don t see how said justice would be enforced   gt  the same way insurance companies cooperate to settle claims between themselves out of court to save costs  And if there was no one to force them to pay anything or to enforce the situation they d have no reason to cooperate They would just say  we re not paying you now stfu   gt Judges aren t impeached bad politicians aren t elected out of office to be replaced with good ones  I ve seen judges impeached both for good reasons and because they did something the community they were in disagreed with I ve seen politicians elected out of office The trick is to actually educate the masses to stop the ignorance That s the big problem   gt when people protest they are beaten shot and caged at worst and ignored at best  So work to fix this not dismantle society 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Much of it is valid 
PoliticalDiscussion,I used to work at a company that during the Summer would let you work  hours M TH and then go home at lunch on Friday  I had a douche of a boss that didn t let my team do that though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I assume they ll do what us fiscal conservatives will be are doing this election attempt to choose the lesser evil 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is that this is already happening  I am on a salary yet I m expected to work  hours every day   counting lunch hour   I don t currently have  hours of work to do so I m on Reddit  If I understand your comment right then I should just be able to go home until I have something else to do  I agree that I should be able to but unfortunately I am not allowed to do so  Sitting around all day also hurts productivity  It makes me sort of uninterested in my job sometimes  Also after sitting around bored all day if someone gives me something to do  minutes before I m supposed to go home and that task is going to take longer than  minutes to do you can bet that I don t do it until the next day and why should I  I ve already been here all day  It s not like I won t have the extra time tomorrow    Edit    I do have busy times just not right now  Why can t my work schedule adjust accordingly 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot to make an argument
PoliticalDiscussion,You are accurate in your definitions What I said is true Universally true to the human experience 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does it really matter Neither side listens to the  people anyway They do what they want and then pat themselves on the back for limiting our freedoms and destroying the Constitution Bill of Rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes Just start working  hours a week 
PoliticalDiscussion,The religious right will vote for the Republican duh 
PoliticalDiscussion,Imho defining anything with regard to rush Limbaugh is an insult to and adulteration of civil discourse and the English language 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s from  Rock     gt Kenneth Parcell I don t choose Democrat or Republican because choosing is a sin so I just write in the Lord s name   gt Jack That s Republican we count those 
PoliticalDiscussion,You might enjoy reading G K Chesterton 
PoliticalDiscussion,     sigh I wouldn t put it past us
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think black people are that prejudice against Muslims though It s a common religion that lots of black people subscribe to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Now you re getting it 
PoliticalDiscussion,amen
PoliticalDiscussion,Not so fast I live in a predominantly black neighborhood and I hear all the time how  even though Obama is a Muslim I ll still vote for him  I agree that most people who think the President is Muslim are misinformed rednecks from the South but by no means is it the entirety 
PoliticalDiscussion,As opposed to calling them sluts and prostitutes which is for conservatives 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s Republican We count those 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s an option  countries we could become the EU 
PoliticalDiscussion,You make a very valid point that I can t argue with science therefore I can t argue at all But what do you think of prevention Data directly shows that once Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in  murder rates dropped almost immediately  It expanded the already existing death penalty to include  more violent crimes  
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t work the French tried reducing the maximum workweek to no avail in terms of job growth It s due to the fact that this holds the false assumption that there are a fixed amount of jobs in the economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are a lot of factors involved  One is that because most successful professional comedians are liberal and because it s a fairly fraternal career liberals are likely to get along better in it  It s a self reinforcing cycle and it started a long time ago when only outcasts became performers it s been going on since before there were stand up comics as we think of them today back to vaudeville and before  There s also the problem that it s easy to make conservative policies sound funny by simply talking about a lot of them but it s hard to make liberal ones sound funny without sounding like a complete tool  Take as an example gay rights  There s a lot of easy targets there hypocrisy of adulterers attacking gay marriage under the banner of the sanctity of marriage etc  Turn it around and what do you say  About the least offensive thing you can say is  Man if I were them I d be lobbying to ban marriage for everyone amiright fellas   Attacking most liberal policies requires walking a very fine edge between attacking a minority or a disadvantaged class without being overtly racist classist whateverist  That s not to say there aren t some skilled conservative comedians but they tend to play differently  A good example of this is Jeff Foxworthy who is conservative but largely skips talking about anything policy related in favor of things like  you might be a redneck and talking about his family etc  Jeff Dunham the ventriloquist has some actually pretty racist material but he says it through puppets like Ahmed the Dead Terrorist  I m not joking  and therefore often gets away with it  Larry the Cable Guy plays with the idea of blue class people being treated like idiots but actually being more clever than all them elitists giving them credit for 
PoliticalDiscussion,I work  hour days and get every nd monday off  I also get to telework ror  days every two weeks  It is working out pretty well for me so far 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no way this guy is going to get protection under stand your ground  What happened is some douchebag killed a kid and was hoping the law would cover him  It won t and he will be tried for murder 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s because the things that are ridiculous about conservatives are things that affect everyone and are easy to understand   the social issues  The things that are ridiculous about liberals are require an understanding of economics to mock   Nobody is good enough to teach economics to a drunk audience for a joke 
PoliticalDiscussion,Write in vote for Jesus  Choosing is a sin 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you did it d be morally just Answer me this at what point does using the justification of  for the greater good become non applicable What about the minority of people who disagree yet are forced to pay anyway for say war or drug prohibition The argument  against taxation being theft falls down to might is right If you have the guns and prisons to force people who oppose you to pay for things they d otherwise find morally egregious it s morally acceptable Voting in and of itself isn t enough there s a group of  people  people vote to rob the remaining  there s no way to enforce this declaration without force behind it Saying one is a willing participant in this is like saying the shop owner paying the mob for protection money is a willing participant because he paid them There s more mob members than shop owners they have the might to enforce their declaration so it must be morally just The shop owners had a vote it was overruled by the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,Paul s position as I understand it is that the government should not back or subsidize higher education and student loans My question is what would stop private financial institutions from stepping in and filling the void once government steps out Wouldn t big banks and lending companies extend a comparable level of credit to students at higher interest rates and with more aggressive marketing resulting in a similar paradigm to the one that created the current  bubble   Further with less students able to afford college without loans wouldn t institutions be forced to  raise prices to compensate for lower enrollment Could we face a nation wide  brain drain during the interval between the end of federal subsidy and the normalization of tuition costs Universities have contracts to fulfill and facilities to maintain how many would survive with substantially reduced enrollment or  alternately diminished tuition   Are we willing to allow higher education to become the exclusive province of the wealthy or to allow our high tech and high education jobs to be filled by non citizens who pay a minimum of US taxes I d rather that my doctor or my lawyer was the smartest and most qualified person not the guy whose parents had sufficient financial resources to pay for his tuition   I think student loan reform is necessary and would support measures that would minimize debt and ensure that money was spent wisely  federal loans only for in state tuition at state schools max of  years of eligibility for undergrads graduated tuition based on earning potential etc  However I see any measure that would make college attendance  impossible for large numbers of Americans to be detrimental to our national culture and conscious 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thieves beg to differ I don t get to attend their yearly conference and vote on who to rob  
PoliticalDiscussion, shoving Ron Paul down our throats    My point exactly  They can never just accept that he was right yet they still enjoy the posts discussing what he discussed years prior 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree but there are some reasons why what you re describing won t happen As always  George Carlin says it best  
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey here s a crazier idea   how about  separate laboratories of democracy  We could have a group maybe call it a  Supreme Court  that would make sure none of these   states trampled on inalienable rights but other than the federal government would leave people alone to experiment with what works  I know I know too crazy and radical 
PoliticalDiscussion,The new frontier  until space should be education and new professional fields After all how the hell are we going to get to space  We right now have the resources and technology to make education available to every single American virtually regardless of where they live The internet is largely to thank for that  Unfortunately the US seems not at all interested in helping its citizens get high quality affordable higher education to help transition into new professions Hell the US isn t even largely interested in giving its citizens a decent basic education And the US seems hell bound on restricting the internet arguably the greatest communication and learning tool since the printing press in any way possible  TL DR the new frontier could be education and new professions to move the world forward   but the US largely seems not at all interested 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are a couple parts that are surely unconstitutional Sadly the SCOTUS may rule in favor of the mandate even though that isn t even close to any definition of commerce back in the day or now 
PoliticalDiscussion,What That is the case Polling data has shown that Sorry 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not even a matter of people being angry enough The boundaries have to be drawn by someone and by definition they re going to be from one party or another 
PoliticalDiscussion,The U S has had waves of anti intellectualism before I think the  Know Nothing Movement of the s   is the closest parallel to the current situation   Previous waves have tended to be locally nasty but short lived The dynamics are different this time because of the spread of nationwide mass media that s accessible to niche audiences I still hope that the current anti intellectualism movement will burn itself out but it s going to take another couple of election cycles 
PoliticalDiscussion,It won t work because both neocons and liberals think their views are perfect and need to be applied in the whole country  Think about the immoral things that will happen in other states   both sides 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure   Changes to achieve competitive elections  I especially like the idea of redrawing districts based on geometric non ideological criteria    Objective rules to create districts
PoliticalDiscussion, gt the division was likely an arbitrary choice by the British like most of their colonies  The  history is a little more complicated than that The  Wikipedia article on the Partition of India   needs some editing but it s a good place to start   South Asia is an amazingly diverse place You find dramatically different linguistic religious and ethnic groups living very close to each other  cross a river mountain or any other natural border and you re likely to find yourself in a different culture Even  the grouping the West calls  Hindu    Definition contains enough variety to be counted as three or four different major religious ethnic groups in most parts of the world   These different cultural groups managed to get along because they d all more or less evolved or grown up together  The arrival of Islam in the s AD   The Islamic Sultanates sort of upset the balance Since then the only times when Muslims and Hindus have really gotten along is when they ve been conquered by an outside power   After  the British knew that they were going to lose India after World War II ended They had time to do some planning but not a lot of resources Mountbatten and the rest of the sensible Brits mostly wanted to get out in a way that left stable nations in place preserved British commercial interests and did NOT set off another war  The Brits  didn t quite succeed with that last goal   The process was actually surprisingly democratic  every state principality got to vote on which country it would belong to The process was far from perfect but it was an awful lot better than what would have happened if the British had been thrown out by a violent revolution   
PoliticalDiscussion,Except it is
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope people who think taxation is theft lack empathy  
PoliticalDiscussion,Grouping people with various positions as if they were one homogeneous group and then shoving Ron Paul down our throats  This is going to start a fun conversation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neither party would benefit from it so I wouldn t say  reasonably  
PoliticalDiscussion, Lib students will ask for a bailout  the same ones that condemned the bank bailouts and who are apart of OWS   Education costs will temporarily rise before slowly decreasing in cost assuming the government gets out once and for all   People will not learn their lesson and still ignore Ron Paul 
PoliticalDiscussion, Yeah you can   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What he is doing is blatantly ignoring the voice of the People They do not want him to be their nominee  The people are not the ones that decide who the nominee is  The republican party does that  They have a process that includes some input from the public but there is no imperative to do that  The will of the people that most illusory of concepts is expressed in the general election 
PoliticalDiscussion,The bubble can t burst because you can t declare bankruptcy to get out of a student loan 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know  Honestly the biggest problem with the rural US is religion and anti intellectualism  But they do have a point a gun law made for the south side of Chicago doesn t make sense on a cattle ranch  Illinois is always going to be divided between Cook County and the rest of the state  About the only thing you can do is make separate rules for large urban areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ideological political ethnic religious And forgive me if I m wrong but the division was likely an arbitrary choice by the British like most of their colonies 
PoliticalDiscussion,not really  
PoliticalDiscussion,Any comedian who use cynicism as their foundation I d call conservative esque at least   E g  Everything new sucks it was better when I was growing up  
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a good point How fine do you want the red blue divisions to be Everywhere in the U S  cities tend to be more liberal than rural areas Does Chicago secede from Illinois How about Austin seceding from the rest of Texas   At some point people who think differently have to learn to get along or you wind up with warring feudal estates 
PoliticalDiscussion,The bill as a whole is NOT unconstitutional  If you re referring to the individual mandate that every person in the country must have insurance then yes that is questionable 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s not underplaying the problems he s saying any logistical problems are non issues because the national government wouldn t allow it anyways 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good example Those two countries are a great example of the cost of allowing an ideological divide to sunder a nation  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m no expert but I m gonna guess that the bubble will continue unless   alot  of people cannot pay back that money If that does happen since student loans are a such a large percentage of debt held by banks it would cause a financial meltdown starting with a credit freeze since the government and the banks held loans are now worthless and like that trillions of dollars are erased 
PoliticalDiscussion,No 
PoliticalDiscussion,Marginal reserve rates   I thought you said  marginal reserve DATES   HAHAHAHAHAA
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t say that single payer is the only good solution  Singapore has a system that is more privatized than ours and it s also miles ahead of ours in terms of quality of care and cost savings  But then again Singapore s healthcare system relies on people being responsible and self sufficient which is apparently an evil concept according to liberals 
PoliticalDiscussion,As I said this is misleading because it counts things that go towards GDP that have nothing to do with productivity like wealth produced from natural resources 
PoliticalDiscussion,Health insurance company profit margins average about    It s not the insurance companies that make our healthcare so expensive 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we were to somehow break the two party lock on US politics at that point we could fix gerrymandering    Step  is to require public financing for all campaigns to allow for more voices and candidates    Step  is to allow  alternative voting   this will give rise to new parties and coalitions of smaller parties none of whom will be eager to keep the gerrymandering scheme as it exists today  Step  is to wait for the judiciary to start reflecting this new reality of multiple parties so the D s and R s cannot block initiatives in court as easily as they could do today  After all of that then sure we can fix it  But that s a  year process I just described  
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe it is effective as a deterrent when applied properly It shouldn t be legal if it is not effective as a deterrent Currently there isn t evidence that it is effective so I don t want it legal I don t mind it being legal in certain jurisdictions as an experiment and if they ever figure out how to effectively use it as a deterrent then I would want it to be available nationally I don t think it is unjust but I want a more merciful system if it doesn t benefit society in any way to have it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It has to be included as a special part of my contract that I am willing to work over  hours a week I m not sure I do though Most will work less     is probably the expected If you re paid by the hour you d expect double time after hours 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s better than what we had before but as the old saying goes  you can t shine a shit  The whole system needs to be reworked to make healthcare actually affordable for everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes These are the biggest yet most basic problems I see with our political system  The two party system and  too much money corporate influence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I honestly don t understand why this isn t the standard You could hire more people by covering the extra day off everyone gets I would sooo much rather have it this way  Also  US resident here mandated leave and sick time Comparable to the more civilized nations out there  weeks and  days if a company is nice enough to give it to you is awful 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think ultimately what would work best without too much disruption would be to include more parties in the political system a la other countries  Sweden has  for example     When you only have two parties it is way too easy to get into the state where we are now They both work together to ensure the other s survival and are ultimately more easily corruptible by corporate and wealthy interests  That being said I don t think that would solve it all You still have  major concentrated points of power with undoubtedly a few larger parties   I guess one of the big reasons is how much money it takes to be in large scale politics these days Kind of takes the sails out of participatory democracy when only so many Americans can even afford to play the game to begin with 
PoliticalDiscussion,It needs a large public outcry for this to ever be changed It s the problem when the people who benefit from a law are the only ones who can change it It s really a terrible problem for democracy though and everyone is at it It s especially bad in that it ensures incredibly high re election rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neil DeGrasse Tyson makes this point quite elegantly in a number of his talks If youre interested in it you should watch them very interesting and insightful He uses the terminology of  scientifically literate 
PoliticalDiscussion,The areas with high property tax would not vote for their taxes being allocated to different schools Why should they want their tax money going to fund other people s schools  That right there is the fundamental reason why our school system is flawed in the way you have pointed out I dont agree with the counter argument that I ve provided but unfortunately thats how people work I think this demonstrates a short mindedness on the part of the people who believe this They want the taxes on the money that they earned to go back into something they are a part of like their kids school Yet if we were to have a better education system across the country through use of their taxes than the entire country would benefit not just their little area But like I ve said most people are able to rationalize this and make an effort to make it a reality
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How does a homogenous culture automatically insinuate that they are ignorant small minded  Well first off how would one enforce the homogeny Do people that operate outside this  consensus concerning societal rules get fined Imprisoned Deported Killed And who defines what this consensus consists of because surely in a place such as America with so many different cultures such a consensus would never truly be reached So this is why I previously said I think this kind of thinking is the most fictional of all The only way to establish and enforce a single codified system of morality would be to establish a dictatorship or fascist government Seriously look at history and find me a society that was homogenous without also being ruled by an oppressive regime Stalinist Russia Maoist China Feudal Japan Nazi Germany Fascist Italy   Only a few examples of  homogenous societies  would you want to live in any of them   gt You cannot expect someone from Russia to automatically get along with someone from Uganda They are two different worlds apart  Yes Yes you can It s called compromise It s what this country was supposed to be about People are always going to have differences and not all of them are inherently tied to ethnicity There is certainly infighting among Russians and believe you me there is infighting among Ugandans To reach a truly functional society compromise amongst all groups and beliefs must be attempted to ensure the greatest freedom for everyone That means that if one of your beliefs impedes others from being successful and safe on principle than it should not be allowed And that s the kind of thinking that we should be trying not the sectionalism and closed door policies that homogenous societies breed   gt Why shouldn t they try Why shouldn t they be allowed to form their own society  No I m saying that if they can find some unclaimed piece of land somewhere and they want to settle there and start their own country with their own set of laws more power to them But they shouldn t try to do it  in america  That would be wrong because there are many different cultures here and to try to establish one culture above all others would be inherently discriminatory    gt I m sure the people who lived in once prosperous Detroit had to  suck it up before that area got consumed with crime and went down the shitter  There were a great deal of factors that contributed to decline of Detroit and if you re insinuating that it is solely because of the influx of black people into the city you re delusional  
PoliticalDiscussion, no matter where you live you can move just a few states away into the government you prefer   So you would basicaly have the United  States but without the constitution to protect freedom of movement   interstate trade  Why

PoliticalDiscussion,I completely agree actually 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obviously Islam was an offshoot of Christianity  I would say it s more accurately an offshoot of Judaism that came about post Christ 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s unfortunate that we re half assing healthcare when a single payer system is the only good solution 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think culture has a big influence on it  Yes i agree completely with that sentiment And if we look at what kind of fundamental values and beliefs most americans have grown up on this system seems pretty bleak Granted I support this completely but I think our ideas of freedom and the notion that we are able to move freely across the country and just the whole idea of being your own person will not permit most citizens from getting behind this and actually allowing it to work the way it is supposed to 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you mean since   
PoliticalDiscussion,But what good is all this saved money going to be if there s no atmosphere to protect it from being burned up by the sun s radiation Look I m not exactly a green fanatic myself but I do think that climate change should be a concern for politicians and I don t see how conservatives who claim to be so worried about the welfare of future generations can so flippantly disregard it 
PoliticalDiscussion,All modern politics is lies If you think differently you are fooling yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the phrase  religious right has two parts If they can t vote based on religion they ll always have the right That s why they are refered to as the religious right because they ll always vote republican  But I dont think it s important to know who they ll vote for What s going to be important about them is if they will be bothered to organise shit at a grass roots level for the mormon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah people who don t want to rob other people lack empathy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah I agree It s going against the spirit of the constitution to apply it to individuals really

PoliticalDiscussion, gt So here s my thought The country is split not down the middle into a left right sort of setup but rather by their majority political association Red states would be governed from the local level up to the top by a conservative republican government blue states by a liberal democratic and swing states by a more moderate government   This is a terrible idea and here s why  
PoliticalDiscussion,The religious right will vote for the white one  duhh
PoliticalDiscussion,  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a band aid on a system that needs amputation  The central problem in a for profit health care system is that there is a paradox between the desires of the insurance company and the customer  The customer the sick person wants as much care or money as possible while the insurance company wants to pay out as little as possible  And when customers go up against billion dollar corporations they are unlikely to win  If they do receive promises of more money and care they will pay far in excess of what the company is actually likely to pay out  This is why our costs are more than x Europe s per person while we have lower life expectancy and a significant proportion of the population is without insurance    What the US needs is a European or Canadian style system which can keep costs down provide health care to everyone and focus on preventative medicine  which is far cheaper in the long run   And increasing the quality of care is also quite simple simply spend more money  There is no risk of that money being funneled off into profits or side industries so there is would be a positive correlation between the amount of money spent and the quality speed of care received so long as the population or government agrees to do so    It s quite simple really  I just don t understand why it s so controversial 
PoliticalDiscussion,Healthcare should be nonprofit   But then again I think everything should be nonprofit since I am a communist 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the response  It s quite interesting to hear about how the norm differs in another country  Could you make a guess at the average adult s workday length in the UK  I ask this because a common reason I have heard for lack of involvement here in the US is that a single parent  absentee spouse deceased spouse etc  has to work late to  pay the bills so that children are often left without any guidance until late in the evening at which point the parent may be too tired to help etc or there is just not enough time for homework at that point  Again so many things to factor in 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a student pursuing his degree in teaching and therefore a professional in the subject per internet logic here is my take  Education is something that lacks a silver bullet Several things must be implemented First off elimination of standardized tests as a way to rate teacher or student success I don t know a feasible measurable alternative but I m open to suggestions there   Secondly the stigma surrounding corrupt greedy teachers needs to be obliterated and pay and benefits need to be on par with other government jobs perhaps on a national scale Disclaimer This isn t me  speaking selfishly In South Korea teachers are Nation Builders and it s a highly sought position because of the influence it entails It is incredibly stressful to be an educator juggling  children at a time at all different learning levels and backgrounds for  consecutive hours a day with only  or so minutes between classes Then taking that work home to grade adds further stress And on top of that  of teachers give approximately   of their income  averaging nationally NBC  to buy their own classroom supplies materials and other equipment  Money MUST be set aside to give teachers a prep hour to complete necessary tasks during the work day or compensate them for after school hours spent grading or constructing lesson plans or jumping through any other regulatory hoop Further each teacher should get a budget  the size of which I can only speculate  for classroom supplies materials or furniture ASIDE from what the school already provides   Moving right along there also needs to be a societal shift that takes place regarding education This is much more theological and I admit my own views aren t even fully fleshed our or nailed down But Parents need to play more of a role in their child s education This may require a more specific parenting shift to have more control over what their son daughter does in their free time or providing more social wellness programs to allow parents to be home more during developmental stages I don t know But the bottom line is that teachers cannot babysit  students for  hours a day  The parents MUST take over responsibility for their child s knowledge and education from the afternoon to evening for a continuation of learning  On top of all of this there must be reconciliation between Public Education standards and the standards of colleges I ve always supported the Federal Government taking over and mandating curriculum standards more in keeping with what and how student are expected to perform upon pursuit of higher education There s also the question of smaller things such as student s time management day length or class length start and end times afterschool programs in urban blighted or endangered areas class sizes etc  But seeing as my views are still developing feel free to give me some feedback 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you underplay the problems Who gets the military Is it done equally Based on the taxes paid Location Certain states have a large military infrastructure that s been paid for by other states What about other infrastructure What if California wants to sell energy to New York but the red states in the middle say fuck you etc etc  Another big thing that ensures it will never happen is that no one wants it to happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with you good sir

PoliticalDiscussion,One of the saddest things about    other than the wars and death  and the serious stuff was the  loss of Dennis Miller to the conservative side  One of the sharpest wits of our time  
PoliticalDiscussion,My opinion is its better than the old system we had I know Romney says he wants to repeal it and give out tax credits instead but to the poor people who can t afford good insurance tax credits mean jack shit There needs to be a system where everyone is treated regardless of their bank account where they don t have to worry if taking a sick child in is going to bankrupt the family 
PoliticalDiscussion,We took a joke for eight fucking years     
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there s a lot of spin that s been put on it that s obscured actual debate  then again what  isn t in US politics these days     I don t claim to have read into it much so this is an admittedly ill informed opinion  fair warning  I think the idea of universal healthcare is a wonderful idea and the US is miles  or should I say kilometers  behind most of the rest of the Western   industrialized worlds and it s about time we got caught up I think it s an interesting way to  back door in socialized medicine in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Stalking is not to be taken lightly You do it at one s own risk Try stalking a few people from your local Wall mart see how long that lasts  For the people who take things too literally Please don t do this 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is imperfect but an improvement over the status quo  I think fully socialized  single payer health care would be a great improvement Decoupling insurance from employment  and income would remove a giant risk for people who might otherwise try their hand at entrepreneurship

PoliticalDiscussion,That s why its hypothetical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Worked for Dickens 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you want an honest answer you re only hearing the shallow counter attack point of view  Republicans don t want free contraceptives Must be because they hate women and casual sex  This is why politicians can control us so easily If you want to argue the issue know the real issue Conservatives don t want this to pass because they don t believe that this is a fundamental right to be provided by the government  taxpayer money or forced into all insurance policies The left says that this is a major health issue that needs to be given to everyone and paid by everyone Here are the main problems with this proposal   Where does it stop You have to wonder why this is so important and vital to women s health and not breast cancer screening or other serious illness detection It is seen by many to be an easy stepping stone so in the future they can say  Well this is kind of ridiculous that ONLY birth control is mandatorily covered and not all these other serious things We need to add everything if contraceptives are covered    It goes against many peoples beliefs to pay for someone elses abortions or other contraceptives Would it be fair to Vegans if we decided that meat should be free and paid for with tax dollars Nobody is outlawing casual sex or contraceptives and as freedom loving Americans we would all stand up against any such invasion into our private lives And that s the point You can t have it both ways Either we are free to decide what we pay for the way we live and what we do or we need to control what everybody does Once you start chipping away at freedoms it becomes a snowball effect and after a few hundred years of tiny unnoticeable laws you re left with nothing  I am completely open to debate this I m probably the only person on Reddit that will as long as we re debating the real issue Should this be paid for by every American citizen be it male female Christian Muslim etc  Insurance plans that cover this already exist and are quite affordable I should know my wife makes minimum wage and pays for it easily Everyone s insurance premiums will actually go up and the only way to help that is Government intervention  tax dollars  Nothing is free   Edited for formatting  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s funny because you are the one who is trying to have it both ways You want a liberal to be able to dress up in black face and make a bunch of racist jokes and you don t want to call the action or the jokes racist  I don t think that any of this is particularly good or desired As I said before a pox on both their houses I don t think that any of this should be in our political discourse nor do I think that their actions were warranted or needed They are guilty of stereotyping an entire group of people who don t agree with them politically which I find completely toxic They aren t however guilty of being racist    gt That s because it wasn t anti racist It was simply anti conservative You have this mindset that liberals can t possibly be racist   It s quite humorous that you believe that  I never said that liberals can t be racist They very easily can be but the simple fact is that social conservatism has a direct correlation with racism I won t deny that it s was anti conservative either but it was specifically anti conservative with regards to them being racist That they didn t distinguish between social conservatism and liberal conservatism is a glaring omission and one that needs to be pointed out But not taking it into context is also an omission   In all honesty people on all sides need to stop feeling like they re being victimized by things that they find offensive This whole partisan  your group is the worst mine is the best excludes the possibility of any honest discussion about very real and tangible problems that we face and will continue to face in the future In fact I tend to think that lumping people into groups as broad in range as  conservative and  liberal never takes into account the great variety within those two ideologies themselves Conservatives as a whole tend to marginalize the other side as simply being  left wing  a bunch of hippies or bleeding heart liberal communists while liberals marginalize the right as being a bunch of amoral racist douche bags who only care about not helping the poor Yet the only thing these positions do is dehumanize the other side so that we can easily dismiss what they have to say  Sorry for the rant I kind of went off a bit there 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was thinking about congestion reduction myself actually I thought we could stagger workdays in a given area          to spread out the traffic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Comedy requires two things a strong sense of introspection and the ability to laugh at yourself   Modern conservatives can t do this because the movement  of late demands ideological purity You can t question the conservative platform without being branded a traitor   Most liberal comedians have no problem mocking liberal politics Comedy doesn t work if you re only attacking other people Self deprecating humor is a great way to form a connection with the audience 
PoliticalDiscussion,Will salaried employees still make the same pay I can see employers not being happy about having to pay the same for less   
PoliticalDiscussion,Would be nice but I rather we did away with a standard workday completely With modern communication technology there s really no reason for everyone to have to be in the office at the same time   If everyone worked hours that were convenient to them we d eliminate rush hour which would save a ton on gas 
PoliticalDiscussion,Furthermore I m not sure splitting the country up would benefit any of the resultant pieces Seems like we d be damaging our economies for little real benefit  It sounds like what OP wants is more autonomy at the state level Perhaps a stricter interpretation of the Tenth Amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here in the UK parents are encouraged to join in with the kids education through homework  I m sure my parents had to sign off everything I d done before handing it back up to about  or that I d read a book that night or whatever   However you can t force parents to join in  My sister is a primary school teacher    and they encourage parents to get involved they have parents evenings report cards etc but if the parent doesn t want to then they won t  I would note that in the UK we have much more holiday than you do in the US  days statutory  so parents have more time to spend with their kids even if they work full time  We also have many more  free activities that parents and children can get involved in  not that I can think of any off the top of my head  things like museums in London are free for all children travel free on public transport parks are more common local sports teams are within walking distance etc   That said our education system works like this  You have a national curriculum that every teacher has to teach  although they can choose how  meaning that every child faces the exactly the same test at the end of it  Figures are officially published on how well the school  junior and senior did in terms of kids grades and independent audits  There is a group that turns up at a school and works out why it failed audits and makes improvements  Teachers themselves are sent on lots of training courses and have half a day each week free to do lesson planning  There are often teaching assistants for a class  or a group of classes who can help look after classes giving the teacher more chance to be able to focus on those who perform poorly  The problem that we have is that kids are taught to pass exams not necessarily to learn and there is a question of dumbing down exams to make it seem like kids are more intelligent thane before 
PoliticalDiscussion,The scientific evidence doesn t really agree We are complex social creatures and sex plays into that We are far more succesful as a species when are not alone Women search for long term mates to promote the success of their offspring Men compete for resources in order to be able to compete for mates as women will tend to look to mate with men that are most likely to be able to provide for them   There is a huge amount of research done on sexual jealousy attachment theory etc Great apes for example exhibit jealousy as a way to promote low female promiscuity etc etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say that the people who will vote based on the candidate s religion see Mormonism as an offshoot of Christianity and Islam as its own separate entity possibly one at war with Christianity   Obviously Islam was an offshoot of Christianity the same way Mormonism is today but I m not sure how many people who decide their vote on this sort of thing would know that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which societies Christianity believes you should have sex only in marriage Judaism agrees Islam believes men can have several marriages Shia women are allowed to enter one Hindus generally believe extra marital sex to be immoral Buddhists believe that you should free yourself of sexual cravings   There is no evidence I m aware of that suggests Sexual liberalisation is not a new phenomena   But my point isn t that its okay It s that it s that the base level for societies isn t secular humanism It s thousands of years of sexual oppression and that oppression needs to be overcome You can t just expect people to realise it It s not the default position any more than democracy is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah okay   
PoliticalDiscussion,The argument equating taxation with theft is weak just because you feel morally outraged by opposing murder and meyhem doesn t mean everyone else does  Just because a minority disagrees with them doesn t make it robbery

PoliticalDiscussion, gt By not having many NAMs Simple As That  NAMs 
PoliticalDiscussion,The argument equating taxation to theft is strong just because you feel morally obligated to support murder and mayhem doesn t mean everyone else does With this new perspective in mind those who would prefer to not pay taxes  at least toward certain activities are being robbed Just because a larger group of individuals disagrees with them does not make it any less robbery 
PoliticalDiscussion,Slamming Obama for trying to show support for Trayvon Martin s family Some people will make any excuse to hate this guy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m upvoting you I think you make a good point and appreciate your insight   I understand that evolutionary history has brought us to where we are But what I don t understand is why in a mostly modern society that we live in where we question and fight all kinds of racism bigotry misogyny and general intolerance and injustice in our world everyday why most of us wouldn t just make our voices heard and point out how absurd this is What actually confuses me most of all is that WOMEN are taking the role as helpless victims and saying  Ok we like sex we re sluts so what  I don t understand that approach at all Why isn t the reaction  Hey if I m having casual sex the person I m having sex with is equally a part of this be it a man or a woman then neither of us needs to be looked down upon    What I m trying to say is I understand how historically women have been oppressed by men but why are we all being so blind about this and just accepting that women are at fault and are the ones that need to defend themselves Shouldn t men have an equal voice in this debate and shouldn t we both be defending each other instead of turning this into a gender war 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman What 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who gets the military That s right This is really the question and why the federalists gained power in the first place because the states rights proponents never stood a chance against the big power players who wanted a centralised military They wanted it and they killed their own citizens to get it I m so glad for the chance to come right out and say this because no one wants to discuss this issue though it was at the forefront of this country s inception and a huge debate during the time between the revolutionary and civil wars Love reddit dammit 
PoliticalDiscussion,English is a Germanic language not a Hellenic one In that light if  language conquering history repeats itself in the manner you say it will then the Germanic language of English should win out over the Romance language of Spanish  see Rome fall of   TL DR English comes from German not Greek
PoliticalDiscussion,To pretend that this wasn t a race based crime is completely ignorant 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand what you re saying but I think you re missing my point What I m trying to argue is not the conservative view of contraception but the  reaction from everyone else That all kinds of people men women liberal conservative whatever strictly see this as a women s issue  If you disregard the conservative views for a minute and we just simplify this isn t the matter of fact that when two opposite sexes have sex for recreation and both agree that they don t want to have a child as a result that it would equally be the responsibility of both parties to take preventative actions So what is the difference between using a condom or a woman using birth control And then why is it the woman s responsibility to defend herself for having this recreational sex  when it is between two consenting adults    Do you understand what I m getting at I m not arguing the conservative debate because I understand where that s coming from but what I m so confused about is why women are taking it upon themselves to play the victims and additionally why there aren t more non conservative men stepping up and saying that women don t have to take all the responsibility

PoliticalDiscussion,The us produces plenty of these so you would have to apply that same metric to us 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would like to think that these comments are extreme examples of the very worst  most ignorant most hateful most gullible in our society but I know that such sentiments are extremely common  I live and work in one of the reddest of red states   a true one party government   and I hear such stuff nearly every day  I learned long ago that using logic or reason or appealing to their Christian dogma gets nowhere  I pretty much keep my mouth shut anymore except for an occasional  hopefully thought invoking question 
PoliticalDiscussion,More importantly many classes of student loans are guaranteed by the federal government Banks literally  can t lose money on them This is why they can offer such low interest rates for people with relatively poor credit  the government eats the losses  The converse of this is that the bubble can t and won t burst until the government stops backing the loans  at which point it instantly collapses

PoliticalDiscussion,Gerrymandering only helps Republicans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes The shortest split line method is a good example Take it out of the hands of people and out it into the hands of an impartial equation    
PoliticalDiscussion,One time California tried to get an independent citizen counsel chosen at random to draw lines and it ended up with interest groups running smear ads about innocent people who were randomly chosen by the state and ultimately the districts the counsel made did not change much at all Not sure how other states work but in NY the governor needs to sign off on the redistricting plans If this holds true in all states then all we need are fifty politicians willing to force legislative elections to be fair so no it s not possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,It depends how much you ve Mander d your Gerry 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well obviously it is going to take time I just pointed out  red flags that will take us to a very interesting uncharted territory The best thing is the opportunity it provides so I m rather happy seeing this pattern If it wouldn t be there I would require some cheering up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Personally I despise it for what it will do to my family My mother is paying huge insurance costs every month due to having cancer thank god she s covered and due to the costs of maintaining her healthcare she will be classified under a  cadillac plan and forced to pay a  tax on her already high costs   I think reform needs to happen to healthcare but if they have to pass a law to fix it I think it should be one forcing all healthcare providers to be upfront about all costs  including what they charge to various insurance companies  If you could see what each insurance company pays for each part of care that d go a long way to self correcting our industry 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is terribly doom and gloom Cheer up buddy   This is the way the world ends   Not with a bang but a whimper   T S Eliot  The world or the US rather isn t going to collapse all in one great cataclysmic event We re just going to slowly year by year election by election recede into the background and recede from greatness It s not going to happen any time soon either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Much obliged 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh it won t really burst in the way that the housing bubble did For one the education market is much more diverse than the housing market So while a house is a house and the price can drop across the board there is a large difference between a degree in Engineering and a degree in French literature So some  parts of the education bubble may burst if you will but the idea that all at once the price of a degree in every field dropping is not going to happen The likely scenario is that schools will shrink and get rid of majors and faculty that there is no market for Some majors will continue to be worth the price tag and some won t 
PoliticalDiscussion, You have to let that happen in the private sphere The only way that will happen is if firms that let people be payed same rate while working less produce more than firms paying them the same rate at more hours 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hopefully its  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes by significantly increasing the number of Representatives thereby reducing the size of Congressional Districts 
PoliticalDiscussion,CGP Grey claims that we can improve gerrymandering by giving an incentive to  bribing whoever makes the districts One important change bribe them to make districts that defeat gerrymandering

PoliticalDiscussion,How do you enforce that  We have in the US a professional arms race because our quality of life is decreasing as real wages and buying power decreases and jobs are being constantly shipped overseas Add an economic recession  depression and you ve got High Octane Job Panic Fuel  The result people feel that they need to work harder and work more and business owners feel that their people need to work harder and work more hours to keep ahead of competition both domestic and foreign so they don t go out of business  The US is working itself into exhaustion for a few extra pennies 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Most government programs spend much more than  in overhead   Medicare doesn t    bureaucracy   gt The Medicare program operates with just  overhead compared to  to  overhead at a typical HMO  Sure there s bloat in the government s budget  I m looking at you DOD but since we re discussing the health care system I think it s appropriate to look at the ways in which the government already provides medical care   gt The much larger factor    is the exorbitant cost of care charged by doctors and hospitals in this country  Under a single payer system the government would be able to negotiate fees and reimbursements for care and services   we ll pay you  XXXX XX for Y service  It s either that or government mandated price fixing otherwise doctors will continue to charge exorbitant rates HMOs will pick up the tab and consumers will be ignorant to the true cost of their care  but continue to complain when their premiums go up   As a side note I very much appreciate this discussion Much more civil and fact based than many I ve had on reddit Cheers to differing opinions 
PoliticalDiscussion,Proportional systems like STV aren t subject to gerrymandering  at least no where near as much depending on implementation  Instead of each district electing one person representatives are elected proportionally to votes across the entire region or country 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m making enough money to pay people to come through your store with a baseball bat on a daily basis Who s gonna stop me you Ha  
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare spends roughly  on overhead while one average insurance companies spend    So that increases costs by a pretty large factor  Doctors and hospitals also cost quite a bit for the same reasons  There is little incentive to lower costs for consumers considering the only other option is to forego care  Add on the fact that these companies are exempt from anti trust and they have even less reason to not raise the price as often as they want 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I do believe it is going to be so strong that it will end left and right paradigm and thus give mankind its well deserved opportunity to evolve its social systems up to its technological capabilities  Nice try Jaque Fresco 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree completely  I was thinking about this and there are simply some services that government ought to provide not because it s moral but because it s pragmatic  These include defense education healthcare and others but I just don t understand the opposition considering the evidence for those government provided services is so strong    On a side note something like unemployment insurance could should be privatized because the private sector can accomplish that service better than government 
PoliticalDiscussion, School attendance rates drop massively for a year or so many schools shut down and those that survive are drastically cheaper to attend  or   The government tries to keep attendance up by essentially having single payer socialized tuition Tuition rises even faster and the country goes even further into debt every year hastening a dollar crisis as the Fed bails out the government over and over by buying up government debt  real market buyers will dry up   This   will look even worse than it does now  My money s on  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There might be other problems but most likely they could be worked around  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well that s fine and all but it doesn t really solve the bigger immediate problem of education What s your response to that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fixing the voting system while I agree is a correct choice is vastly less popular than using independent councils to end gerrymandering  It s been done in CA and Iowa possibly elsewhere  I would need to look   Alternative vote just lost a ballot initiative in the UK  Both the UK and Canada have First Past the Post s more unsightly flaws locked down by ending gerrymandering w independent commissions more accessible ballot access for rd parties and public financing  Those are all very popular things  Still tough to get rolling  but popular  That of course doesn t mean I don t have just as much admiration for the more mathematically accurate and inclusive systems like proportional and preferential voting but they are way less politically viable  Most people know about those  issues but they have no clue that FPTP is an issue or any desire to fix it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Constitution only prohibits government from administering tests It does not prevent people from doing so The Constitution prohibits nothing from its citizens only from the actual government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh look It s repmack And he s spewing bullshit and blatantly wrong  Again 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe he is secretly an atheist Secretly a Muslim would be funny though cause he d be going to Muslim hell 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not really the size of the government that you should worry about more the shape of it If the US changed it s constitution signification to allow a more consensus based democratic process there wouldn t be any need for this 
PoliticalDiscussion,the argument for equating taxation to theft is absurd  It leads us to a government of volunteers where might really does equal right because who is there to say no to the strong  
PoliticalDiscussion,this would only be good if they got the same exact budget and just had to divide it up between more peolpe  Otherwise the surest and most lasting effect is that we would have bunch more corrupt bums on the payroll 
PoliticalDiscussion,No there is a reason people are not willing to lend an  year old     What moron would do that   only the government   No institutions would be forced to lower prices  There would likely be a price increase in the very short term as schools have been weaned that raising prices means they will soon receive more money  This would end very soon when they cannot fill their seats  No innovation would take off and learning would be very cheap or free  Think youtube and the freedom of information age  The market will figure out what makes people best off  Having everyone  smarter may not be the best alternative if everyone is bankrupt  I highly recommend this short video   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I don t know about what will happen to education loan bubble but I do know that whole economy is going to go down the toilet so ultimately this bubble matters close to nothing  What we ll have to face is multi dimensional collapse   Hydrocarbon crisis energy crisis  Debt crisis  Unemployment crisis  All these  will combine to a force this world has never seen before or experienced for that matter I do believe it is going to be so strong that it will end left and right paradigm and thus give mankind its well deserved opportunity to evolve its social systems up to its technological capabilities If that fails well I guess I ll meet many of you in after life or in prison camps   It is too early to give any realistic time and date for multi dimensional collapse but with latest information you could put it somewhere in  years   Well with that being said I just wish you all god spede cause you re going to need it 
PoliticalDiscussion,People would live within their means  Maybe not pay  mo rent in a populated city and instead move to Kansas and grow their own food 
PoliticalDiscussion,Singapore s health care system  mandates that people be responsible and self sufficient   gt Singapore s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions to provide subsidies within a nationalized health insurance plan known as Medisave Within Medisave each citizen accumulates funds that are individually tracked and such funds can be pooled within and across an entire extended family  Medisave is basically a compulsory HSA account   Additionally the government subsidizes all health care services based on income and assets so the poor end up paying substantially less than wealthier individuals  the poorest Singaporeans have  of their medical care paid by the government and the unemployed and those living in goverment provided housing receive free care    There s a lot to like about the Singaporean system  even for us liberals but it s not accurate to suggest that Singapore has a more free market system than the US From mandated savings to government subsidy to price posting and government run hospitals Singapore s health care is probably  more socialized than ours But I m willing to back that if you are 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sure when you deduct million dollar salaries for top executives and the armies of   bureaucrats  and lawyers  that doesn t sound like a private insurance company to me  Are you sure that you re not describing a government run healthcare system there   gt Given that the PPACA had to mandate that insurance companies spend  of their income on providing health care  since ya know that s why they exist I would bet that the private for profit health insurance business model has a fair bit to do with obscenely high health care costs in the US   overhead isn t a crazy high amount  Most government programs spend much more than  in overhead    Yes overhead plays a role in high healthcare prices but its a small role  The much larger factor that everyone loves to ignore is the exorbitant cost of care charged by doctors and hospitals in this country 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A completely unregulated free market allows for private and corporate interests to buy up  or destroy enough competition so that there is no longer any competition  No that s false   Suppose   wants to buy up all the other small convenience stores in order to eliminate the competition If they attempt to do that then it becomes profitable to open up new small convenience stores See how markets prevent what you re ignorantly claiming is an inevitability   
PoliticalDiscussion,I think there s a good amount of truth to that but I m far from believing that the situation is hopeless   The US seems right now to be at a turning point If we can call for a hunt on political corruption end the shameless handjobs passing between Big Business and Big Government rework our political incentive structure to help cut money out of the incentive to run for political office I think we ll see results 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a Paul supporter and I think that his position on higher education would be more beneficial than having future students paying off their student loans until they re  so in the long term it would be better if all goes as planned However things would be very chaotic for this generation What do you say to that How would things work out without completely destroying a generation s financial situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,The US continues to be flummoxed over what services should be provided by the government and what should be left to the free market In our confusion we create inefficient  half and half programs that subsidize private industry with taxpayer dollars This upsets conservatives who object to  income redistribution and higher taxes and liberals who see profit motive siphoning off billions of dollars that the government could have spent directly on the service they endeavor to provide     We have been unable to have a meaningful discussion of what services are crucial for the survival and prosperity of our population  and should therefore be provided by the government and paid through tax revenue and which are discretionary and should be left to the free market The Individual Mandate Medicare and Medicaid Section  housing and federally backed student loans all attempt to bridge the gap between a free market solution and a single payer system and fail miserably in doing so 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that if that were to happen it would force the country to reconsider the college paradigm Free very cheap programs such as the Khan academy MIT s online classes certificates and even things like TED talks youtube etc would become more  credible  I d argue that it s very possible to learn just as much from these cheaper online resources as someone who went to a traditional  year school The only problem with that is it d force people to try harder to actually learn and prove to potential employers that they are just as knowledgeable as someone from graduated from a traditional college 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure when you deduct million dollar salaries for top executives and the armies of bureaucrats and lawyers dedicated to denying coverage and crafting arcane policy guidelines I can believe that there s  only   is left over as  profit for the business   I think it would be more meaningful to have a discussion about insurance company overhead how much of the companies income is spent on reimbursement to hospitals and medical professionals and how much goes to facilities employee salaries and bonuses marketing and litigation Given that the PPACA had to  mandate that insurance companies spend  of their income on  providing health care  since ya know that s why they exist I would bet that the private for profit health insurance business model has a fair bit to do with obscenely high health care costs in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,Independent councils have been and will continue to be blocked by D s and R s  We need structural reform before these councils can be effective 
PoliticalDiscussion,SO I ll expect you to quit your job tomorrow since obviously someone somewhere at your organization who you have no control over is doing something wrong and you must express your displeasure by quitting immediately rather than trying to stop it and get things on the right path to do good  I await your resignation letter to be posted on reddit  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Can t really be fixed  Incorrect  California just started using an independent council to draw the lines  Iowa does it  Canada and the UK have done it for years  
PoliticalDiscussion,You could have a bipartisan commission charged with redistricting  There was a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution a few years ago that would have done this but it didn t pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you missed something  All those are extremely important some more important than the gerrymandering problem itself  However the topic was gerrymandering  You can fix it like the UK Canada and California state governments by using independent councils to draw out district lines  
PoliticalDiscussion,Essentially because it takes the woman s right to make decisions about her body If she wants to get an abortion for any reason  health not wanting a child not having the money to take care of a child  she would have to get permission from the father If he doesn t want her to get an abortion she s out of luck 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll let you in on a dirty little secret high gas prices is an area where environmentalists and gas companies are allies  The higher the gas prices the better prospects for moving away from fossil fuels  Meanwhile oil companies pig out on the high prices and are happy enough in the short term that they don t notice the long term damage to their industry  Shhh   
PoliticalDiscussion,The corporate State considers that private enterprise in the sphere of protection is the most effective and useful instrument in the interest of the nation In view of the fact that private organisation of protection is a function of national concern the organiser of the enterprise is responsible to the State for the direction given to protection Obama  and beyond 
PoliticalDiscussion,The future battle on the ground will be preceded by battle in the air This will determine which contestants has to suffer operational and tactical disadvantages and be forced throughout the battle into adoption comprimise services Get Kony 
PoliticalDiscussion,I realize that it s somewhat a matter of chance in terms of what captures the public attention but it s also a matter of what the meida and the politicians choose to focus upon or get behind  As for the gun control rhetoric   it s popping up in various locations  I just did another quick search and some prominent media outlets are pushing this angle  I m listening to a Democracy Now program about the subject as I type this    
PoliticalDiscussion,That s exactly what I m saying You can t prevent hostile takeover by corporations in a minimal state unless you have coordinated collective action which on the scale of a nation requires representation which would make it basically just government So the two possible results of a minimalist government are totalitarianism or a newer shittier version of our current state Not great options 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because they aren t interested in lowering gas prices They re interested in attacking actual solutions with so called  intuitive solutions The goal here isn t to increase drilling and thus increase supply the goal is to simply prevent other solutions from being used   Or wait I meant to say both sides are just as corrupt as each other  
PoliticalDiscussion,And the federal government will surely stay within its bounds because after all a piece of paper says they have to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sometimes news blurbs tickle our empathic glands and they go viral Happens all the time and for the most part it s just a matter of luck The media machine serves as a huge positive feedback loop and politicians would be foolish not to ride the wave of viral media when it benefits their agenda  But where are you getting this gun control rhetoric I haven t heard anything from anybody trying to politicize this tragedy to reduce our access to guns 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because once the right to secede is granted there is no logical stopping point except down to the individual seceding from government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed with your point I believe the analogy used is  If a key opens many locks it s a master key If many keys open the same lock it is a shitty lock  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Will we soon move to a position where we all have shares in security companies and will need to buy our security rather than have it as a guarenteed human and civil right  Oh no  We ll have to voluntarily buy security rather than being coerced into paying into a government monopoly on security  The tyranny of the free market 
PoliticalDiscussion,I came here to point out the same thing The  red state   blue state nonsense is purely a media pundit phenomenon that really doesn t equate to the actuality if looked at on a  county basis   Like so much else it s but one of a series of oft repeated media lies that highlight supposed differences and attempt to divide people into a horse race mentality that harms necessary and reasonable social dialogue 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I mow your lawn without your consent do I gain the right to force you to pay for my services because you benefited from them Besides this is an absurd argument considering the vast majority of taxes go towards things that have little or no benefit the the people paying them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you please provide me with a definition of theft that excludes taxation I can t find any 
PoliticalDiscussion,Satellites and pair of mirrors and and a man without a home  With a horse and a rider and a clever cunning killer  Silent in error and vocal in spotlights  Lying always sucking on a bottle of that sweet indulgent fluid  Oh greed oh yes oh greed oh yes  Oh greed oh yes  Yeah  Yeah   Yeah   Yeah    Your friendship is a fog     That disappears when the wind redirects   You  Yes you   Father s expectations soul soaked in spit and urine  And you gotta make it where  To a sanctuary that s a fragile American hell  An empty dream  A selfish horrific vision   Passed on like the deadliest of viruses  Crushing you and your naive profession  Have no illusions boy  Vomit all ideals and serve  Sleep and wake and serve  And don t just think just wake and serve  Yeah  Yeah  Left channel   years in this stage  Yeah you re  years in this stage  Yeah    Your friendship is a fog     That disappears when the wind redirects   You Interested in you interested in you  Interested in you interested in you 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you are saying youve seen data that luxemborg has tons of natural resources per capita 
PoliticalDiscussion,No 
PoliticalDiscussion,Got a source on that 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m not   But you did you stated that since  I benefit from government infrastructure I have subconsciously agreed to some invisible contract If I ve no benefit then your argument is invalid You can t then say my benefit doesn t matter obviously it does   gt I and the vast majority of people who live in most countries think that a fair and reasonable way to treat others includes ensuring a level of opportunity  education  protection  the police fire brigades universal healthcare etc and freedom to move  roads transport infrastructure   And those who disagree with your assertions  and that s what they are are being oppressed If each and every citizen actually consented to provide money for these things there d be no moral dilemma The problem is you re extorting these gains illicitly by threatening them with prison Don t cherry coat it it isn t voluntary and it isn t charity when people are being extorted   gt This will never and cannot exist   I suggest you pick up a history book   gt What do you mean the police are private What laws are they enforcing Who makes these laws Who is bound by them Are all of these systems private  Well ignoring that any idiot with a gun and a stick could actually enforce the law covering policing in itself there s many instances in history where polycentric law  yeah it s a thing has provided all of the things you ve mentioned    gt if they are then why not sign upto the police force that says  we ll back you up regardless of your actions that s what i would do and i think most other people would to  This is a defeated and extremely simplistic view of how a polycentric law based system would operate Why not sign up to an insurance company that covers everything Why not sign up for a bank that doesn t expect to be repaid   gt So now we do have a state as Weber views it a monopoly on the use of coercion Except it is answerable only to those who have the money to pay it This isn t really a better alternative in my view I prefer having democratic structures deciding laws rather than people buying justice  You re already  buying justice  except it s a monopoly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow that is a horrifying prediction I was kinda hoping for more direct democracies with the literacy levels rising and all 
PoliticalDiscussion,So screw the future to help the present 
PoliticalDiscussion,this entire thing is about rare earth metals not any boogeyman that can simply be stopped by western military forces As in any war atrocities have been committed by all sides this  machine gun  preacher  much like invisible children gives no hope of the African people having control over their own destinies and they will not as long as they remain helpless and dependent on gun toting religious zealots 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What metric are you using which gauges my net benefit  I m not I don t care about the net benifit of each individual is a society  I care about the effect of those who are in the weakest position in society  If people are going to live in groups then there have to be rules upon which we base reasonable and fair treatment of others The process by which these rules are made and enforced is called a government  I and the vast majority of people who live in most countries think that a fair and reasonable way to treat others includes ensuring a level of opportunity  education  protection  the police fire brigades universal healthcare etc and freedom to move  roads transport infrastructure     gt If one day the firemen were private   police  were private and citizens were educated privately would I owe more to the state for not interfering or would I owe less to the state for refusing to interfere  This will never and cannot exist What do you mean the police are private What laws are they enforcing Who makes these laws Who is bound by them Are all of these systems private if they are then why not sign upto the police force that says  we ll back you up regardless of your actions that s what i would do and i think most other people would to   So now we do have a state as Weber views it a monopoly on the use of coercion Except it is answerable only to those who have the money to pay it This isn t really a better alternative in my view I prefer having democratic structures deciding laws rather than people buying justice 
PoliticalDiscussion,As much as I hate the KONY campaign It has far wider political consequences than this guy and his Orphanage The campaign has been lobbying the US government for military intervention and has rallied huge support from mindless idiots all around the world This guy has had relatively little political impact in comparison 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think bombing Iran is GOP fault and will increase gas prices The oil companies are sitting on THOUSANDS of leases they are not drilling on   Bush increased oil drilling that now Obama is taking credit for Oil companies are refining and exporting more gas from America than any time since  s    What has Obama really done that matters How is higher gas his fault It is because of saber rattling over Iran and market speculation NOT OBAMA POLICY     The GOP are repeating Iraq BS again and leading us down the wrong road with Iran that will devastate our economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes yes That algorithm is non ideological  math  as you claim However aren t there many algorithms suitable for partitioning a population My question is which one do you use And more importantly who decides which algorithm is used 
PoliticalDiscussion,One of Obama s goals is to raise gas prices  His secretary of energy Chu has said that one of their goals is to boost gas prices to european levels to discourage gas use and encourage alternative energy  I don t know why you think this is the GOP s fault 
PoliticalDiscussion,i feel like if we created a system where it was attractive for production companies to all go into a certain state and build an infrastructure around that without anybody forcing anyone it would be alright  for example if you don t have a job and a huge complex opened up offering thousands of jobs and posted these jobs on a government website you could move there if you needed work  while this would stimulate the workforce that was already there 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why are the GOP Fox ignoring this  You re kidding right It s not about reasonable policy or even looking out for what s best It s just political expedient and nothing more 
PoliticalDiscussion,Non asian minorities Basically blacks and hispanics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Two questions and I don t meant to sound combative but     What makes you think a  large public outrcry would change anything I m asking completely honestly The whole  point of gerrymandering is to put a party so overwhelmingly in the lead in a given district that there s no chance of them being defeated Even before partisan divides became as entrenched as they are today you wouldn t find too many say republicans who are willing to put a  libtard in office just to protest gerrymandering The politicians know this Call demonstrate sign whatever it is you feel like doing at the end of the day the party that owns that district knows that s not going to change So long as the system makes it possible for parties to put the candidate they want in front of you  notably starving alternative primary candidates of funding or support the only way the voting results would change would be if large swaths of people voted against their own party    Similar to the above from where would this outcry originate The most you ll hear people complaining about is that they want  their party s candidate to be replaced with some other candidate  from the same party  Gerrymandering protects parties much more than it protects individual politicians  although that comes along as a nice bonus  It exists to make sure contiguous groups of voters  congressional districts are sufficiently overwhelmingly represent one party or another to keep them happy ish  Basically first past the post election systems will always always always not just encourage but inevitably lead to gerrymandering so long as the politicians  parties get to draw the draw the maps And even runoff AV voting encourages it it just makes it harder to maintain  I don t meant to sound like an old buzzkill but I think there s enough evidence now to demonstrate that serious and systemic problems with the political system do not change as a result of  public outcry  Effectively you re trying to fix the rules of a formal system from within the system when the system is designed partially to make those sorts of changes prohibitively difficult  read impossible from within itself 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m going out on a limb here but I think that people s xenophobia plays into this outlook The countries with outstanding educational systems that are sponsored on a federal level are generally speaking much more culturally and ethnically homogeneous than the United States Fact is that when a Swedish person pays high taxes they won t be affected by the thought of  oh no my money is going to pay for  insert ethnic group  s welfare  They know their money is going to help out other Swedes Many of the issues that the United States faces as a nation is that there is no single culture This is what made our country great and it might eventually be the cause of our downfall 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the long term but for a while there would be a lot of high school grads that suffer 
PoliticalDiscussion,At the same time tuition would decrease as there would be less demand if students were unable to get loans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indeed and it appears to be a natural evolution of the power structure that for centuries we ve called  the state    The last major shift was a few centuries ago when  the people took priority over a hereditary oligarchy And a few centuries before that the hereditary oligarchy took precedence over religious elites And a few centuries before that the religious elites took precedence over absolute monarchs This seems the next step the current shift towards corporations and PACs being the most powerful entities pulling the strings of and setting limits upon what up until recently were the most powerful people in a state  elected Congressmen and the President    If history is any guide we re not going to be able to undo this and go back to the power structure of the th and th centuries And if history is any guide this emerging system where non living immortal private entities animated by servants working on behalf of the entity is something that will only become more entrenched over the course of this century As it goes on I would expect the state itself to eventually become a partner of larger corporate entities through a merger  perhaps Apple Exxon USFedGov  and from there fully subsumed and transformed into a fully private corporate entity   I agree with your conclusion that our interaction with the public state will increasingly resemble our interaction with the private corporation as the state is on the trajectory stated above   
PoliticalDiscussion,You ve never been to New Jersey have you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except that s a logical fallacy a false dichotomy Under this reasoning no criticism of the state acting outside of the bounds of the genuine consent can exist Don t like being arrested for victim less crimes Well go live in the forest somewhere There is no such thing as a social contract because it completely rests on tacit consent Tacit consent is not genuine consent You re also stating as fact something which entirely rests on opinion which is government is not only the sole non entity which can provide those services but that they do an excellent job at it If one day the firemen were private police were private and citizens were educated privately would I owe more to the state for not interfering or would I owe less to the state for refusing to interfere What metric are you using which gauges my net benefit What of actions which directly impact me negatively 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am not saying it is acceptable I am saying it is better than nothing  I would rather have the halfhearted sorry then nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion,And it s that exact sentiment that causes public figures to give insincere apologies and continue with whatever repulsive behavior they apologized for   Just going through the motions of something is not the same as doing something  By your logic I could kick you in the nuts give you a halfhearted  sorry bro with a smirk and you would be cool with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot George Carlin    
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I also want to argue with you on taxes   The major problem with taxes in our countries  since I am assuming you are american  is that people are stupid  People don t realize they benefit from a lot of things in society that cost money To get these things you need to pay taxes If you don t want to pay taxes then we don t have  any kind of government On top of that people who make a lot of money don t understand why they should be supporting other people The answer to that is simple because it s the right thing to do as a human being to support the society that helped make you so damn successful   There are problems with our tax system There are too many loopholes for high income earners and not enough for low income earners Things need to be fixed But paying no taxes isn t realistic and people who refuse to pay their taxes are going to jail and rightly so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well said sir 
PoliticalDiscussion,You use weird terms like  the collective and other socio political nonsense terms Just saying  My point is quite simply this  if flawed individuals are in charge of only their own lives and their own resources  For that to happen you need regulations Who will your neighbours complain to Who will they sue you There s no regulation to stop you no law you ve broken What they will do in your system is come to your house kill you and dismantle your factory Now you are dead  Yes the flawed individuals are part of the voting public and can make their views known and perhaps even get them elected  most of the GoP candidates come to mind  But they can also be moderated by other forces from the country to find a more balanced solution   Your example of involving the state is completely flawed I don t even know where to begin Here s an example of how regulation prevents you from starting this factory in the first place   Zoning laws at the municipal level prevent you from building a factory in a residential zone  Environmental regulations means your factory must meet certain standards for air quality and will likely not be pumping out dirty air without being shut down  I don t think your last statement is fair either Let s look at the reality here  If you built it in a laissez faire no regulation system you simply have to have the individual strength and power to build it You need the financial backing to get it created You then simply need to do something to keep your neighbours out of it and not complaining  build a wall or hire an armed guard or two If you get sued  if there is a court system  ignore the lawsuit  they can t compel you to do anything If they send the police after you hire more guards You don t need anybody to sign off on your plan except having enough money to get the armed guards you need  And if you re a really rich person you can hire all the guards you ll ever need to keep the military out of your factory no matter where you build it And there is absolutely nothing anybody can do about it without causing a shooting war in your neighbourhood I m sure your neighbours would love that All it takes is a little money  On the other hand in our system you need to either have a corrupt city government or you need to meet the zoning code environmental regulations and employment standards for your factory Your neighbours can sue you if they don t like it but only with cause People can file complaints to higher levels of government if your city government goes in direct violation of the zoning code  which would never let a factory be built in a residential area  Your city council people may find that they are simply not getting elected next election unless you manage to convince the majority     of the population of your municipal zone that your factory is good for the city as a whole And you know what it might be If it s clean not loud appropriately zoned and beneficial to the city maybe you should have a factory   You are arguing against a strawman yourself You re setting up the most corrupt situation possible and saying  the logical conclusion of this is to destroy the system  That is false Corruption in our system does happen but it should be addressed through other means that preserve the good parts of a regulated socialist capitalist system while trying to minimize corrupted influence Removing regulations is simply not the answer as it will just lead to worse abuses of the system 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand that Rush s apology was not sincere but its still was an apology I know he did it so he would stop losing sponsors but I still feel an apology not matter how insincere is still an apology 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be fair Rush s apology was not an apology to Fluke it was him expressing regret for getting in trouble This is a big difference as an apology is only counted as such when it is sincere and directed to the  his  party  What s more Bill Maher s comment was a simple ad hominem directed t one individual Rush s comments about Fluke were made on account of use of birth control effectively including in his remarks ALL women who use birth control  Both are distasteful but only one disparages  of all people for wanting to have a say in when they have kids and how many 
PoliticalDiscussion,See this is not at all a libertarian viewpoint Monopolies cause real harm to society so they are banned in your system Treating workers like shit is banned Trading the homes of people like commodities should still be banned A lot of things are still banned And maintaining all of those requires a government and one of fairly decent size You are in fact simply arguing for sane regulation of industries not no regulation Most people will agree with that if you present it better But you re presenting it like it s a libertarian viewpoint where we need no government and no regulation which is outright flawed 
PoliticalDiscussion,You haven t answered the question though really Whether they use regulation for good or evil in the current system is a red herring We re talking about what they d do with  no regulation  There are some who would be good global citizens still nobody is arguing that But you can t argue based on the best case scenario you have to argue based on a middle or worst case for realistic results  The reality is there are corporations who would take advantage of a lack of regulation to gouge consumers and put your safety at risk They are also more likely to form monopolies  because a monopoly can basically set the price meaning prices can go high up   My question for you is therefore how do you deal with a monopoly in your system Imagine for the sake of argument they control something essential food medicine clothing housing etc Let s also imagine that this monopoly hunts down competitors  aka anybody who also grows or hunts food and simply shoots them Which is legal under a pure libertarian system This is a worst case scenario yes but I don t think it s too far from reality  You can t make your own without risking being shot You can t buy from other sources You also can t go without it  housing maybe you can in some areas of the world but not here  You are therefore obligated to buy from them at whatever price they set  Or imagine a different scenario which is not far from the truth today either If you have a menial job there is now no obligation for them to pay you anything Sure if you don t like it you ll walk away Now imagine over time what happens if there is even one recession in the economy People are desperate for jobs They will take anything just to get paid The amount of money offered will dip and people will still take it They ll cut it more and more until it s as low as it can go But companies everywhere are doing this so you re not going to get a better offer elsewhere   What happens eventually in these scenarios in my mind is a revolution of the people to establish a governing board to make sure corporations meet certain standards It s inevitable And that s called government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Look either everything is funny or nothing is funny   Why are we so worried about an event that happened almost a decade ago Who cares Nobody got hurt and there were no race riots so why do we drudge it up now At least save your feigned outrage for contemporary events that have real consequences on the present and future instead of worrying about some bad joke  that s what it was btw a joke from   I feel like we Americans actively looked for things to be offended by so we can wax moralistic and let everyone else know why we re more informed and caring than everyone else 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even if you did all band together and stopped doing business with bad companies would that not be some form of government How would you determine good from bad A system of voting Would the people who run the corporations not also get a say in this How do you exclude them  I don t think there s any way you can avoid the scenario you proposed without a government even a minimal one 
PoliticalDiscussion,And when they point a gun to your head  Or when they control the only source of food on the planet through guns  Or when you need essential medicine that they invented and therefore control completely  Not hyperbole at all those are things that would happen without a government to protect you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh and a movie  
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a very good point you raise Different forms of government suit themselves better to different cultures Maybe there are even some where an absolute dictatorship works well   I think Marx wrote something about that  that forms of government evolve as the people they support evolve Communism was never something Marx pushed it was something he saw as an eventual evolution of society  when people had more social responsibility and when technology got us to the point we don t really need a labour model any more we can move towards communism  I do like Canadian politics for that reason A multi party system means you can run anything you want in it  there are communist parties elephant parties the Green party the social left NDP the conservative right Conservative and the middle of the road Liberals I too generally like the Liberal party  they seem to understand best that running a country is a matter of a balanced approach between left and right Sadly that costs them a lot of votes too  I can agree about natural monopolies I think it s very insightful actually Where does society benefit from having a naturally run monopoly and at what level of government does it make sense for these monopolies to exist  And a lot of monopolies don t need to be very agile  To be fair I ve only lived here two years now  I lived in quebec before so I m not sure what s up with Ontario Hydro  This is true we don t know where things will lead Things like gay marriage  may have unintended consequences on our population in a few hundred years  Then again that might be very beneficial considering how our population is exploding right now  Long term consequences are very important but civil rights are as well Denying somebody something in my mind needs a valid concern behind it and one backed up with data Otherwise I think I ll always fall on the side of permissiveness  It would be very nice to have a better discussion for it and I think the Internet is a good place for it It would be great to see a neutrally moderated major issues board for discussing what should and should not be monopolized major issues facing our society and the impact of civil rights with stickies for unbiased research on the matter and for political candidates to weigh in as well   Sadly I think a lot of people just don t care at least that is what it seems like When I have political discussions a lot of people just read their x biased news source and repeat drakh from it The board would likely turn into a cesspool of misinformation and biased studies But it s nice to think about and with more socially responsible people who are actually interested in discussing such things and coming to real conclusions not tied to political affiliations it would be a huge success 
PoliticalDiscussion,If it makes you feel better nobody is talking about kony anymore 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about all the  meetings that have to happen in order for the office to function properly 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what they get for not having shorter work hours It forces people to be more productive 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m simply going to apply FL s stand your ground law to Trayvon after all he s the one who was minding his own business when assaulted by an armed thug If he punched said thug in the face he was absolutely correct to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Minimum district to convex polygon ratio  not an algorithm I know seems to allow people to use their judgement while preventing some of the worst abuses   gt Maybe districts that are drawn along natural societal boundaries make more sense than districts drawn along mathematical boundaries  I think this is the issue with traditional districting  Say there are  Orange voters in one town living next to  Purple voters in  neighboring towns  As a proponent of purple I redraw the districts so that each one contains  Orange voters and  Purple voters thus denying Orange representation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it isn t as big a problem As you alluded to because proportionality is  more or less ensured gerrymandering doesn t really change anything on the large scale It can make a difference on specific districts of course and parties may be seen as weak or  out of touch if they win lots of list seats but few districts  Other consequences might be that if you win more districts than you expected some of your preferred list representatives may not get into parliament Consider a party of  people that gets  seats of representation by the proportional vote By their list they d like to put members  into parliament Unfortunately  of their  weak members  numbers   won their districts so the party s representation is  and   This could weaken the party  One final impact is on marginal parties In New Zealand if you get less than  of the popular vote and win no districts you are not assigned any proportional representation So if there are  seats and you get   of the vote you get no seats instead of  seats If you get   of the vote  and one district  though you  do get  seats  In New Zealand the electorate of  Epsom   has served this purpose for the Act Party in particular acting as one of the deciding factors in the  election Gerrymandering could be a big difference there especially as the seat is not strongly held 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the analogous example is that the prisoner consents to his imprisonment because he lived on a land which had laws and benifited from them Of you want to pay no taxes sound but stop using my stuff Go somewhere that there are no roads no citzens educated publicly no firemen no law no police no army no building regulations etc   Tax isn t theft its your bill for living in society Of you don t wanna pay you can t keep living here 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not that you can influence the algorithm is that you ve chosen to define the problem to be solved in that way The choice of the districting algorithm itself is a political act It s not obvious that the  optimality criterion of the Shortest Splitline algorithm necessarily coincides with the public good so the use of the algorithm has to be justified  Alternative algorithms might make for more competitive elections or might result in representation that is more proportional than others Traditional districting might make more political sense too  remember that the whole reason we have electorates instead of proportional representation is so politicians can represent their district Maybe districts that are drawn along natural societal boundaries make more sense than districts drawn along mathematical boundaries 
PoliticalDiscussion,From what we currently know Zimmerman is going to be convicted  The only real question is whether he should get the death penalty after  that will depend on what specifically he is charged with and the jury

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I wonder if people who work at the NSA ever think to themselves  I m glad most everyone else in the government is too stupid to realize the evil things they could do with the information I have   They might if there weren t people in government who knew exactly what kind of evil things were possible with that information because they are doing them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course it is the health insurance companies  The government also has its hand in  The real culprit is the  somebody else pays the bill system  Any time  someone else pays the bill there is no incentive on the part of the consumer to control costs  The providers can keep increasing charges because the consumer never actually has to pay the bill  We complain about the high cost of medical insurance and the amount of money government is spending on public healthcare  but the reason for both of those is that insurance companies and government are paying whatever the providers charge  Those numbers will keep going up as long as the bills keep getting paid  The legal system also has a hand in  going back to medical malpractice insurance   There are fixes but none that will be pleasant to be in the middle of 
PoliticalDiscussion,The best chance for it to occur would be after the federal government collapses financially  The military will be called home but a strong secessionist movement at that point could work  It would of course mean a second American Civil War  The outcome of that is anyone s guess 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hm  Looking at the questions on the political compass test there are several that are problematic and geared towards producing a certain type of answers because any other answer makes the test taker seem unreasonable  Answers are rated  Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree but there is no neutral answer  For example    If economic globalisation is inevitable it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans national corporations    This question assumes that economic globalization is inevitable and requires that one answer on that basis  There is no option for those who do not believe this nor is there an equivalent question for those who do not    No one chooses his or her country of birth so it s foolish to be proud of it    This question equates being proud of one s country of birth with being proud of it because one was born there and uses loaded words to make being proud of one s country for any reason appear foolish  It is possible to be proud of one s country for its actions that you as a voter or member of the government have an influence on    Military action that defies international law is sometimes justified    Minor quibble here with the word  justified   There are very few military actions that are  justified   There are quite a few that the initiator sees as  necessary   Justification is a propaganda point    Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment    This question assumes that both are not equally important and implies that one cannot be done if the other is    from each according to his ability to each according to his need is a fundamentally good idea   Sounds like a good idea  but in what context  On a child s playground with adults in charge or as a governmental system  As a founding principle of Marxism every government that has ever attempted to operate on this principle has failed miserably at doing so and at serving its people  This question is fundamentally broken using a loaded phrase to define the central principle not defining the context and then requiring the test taker to choose whether the idea is good without context    It s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled branded consumer product    Again loaded language   sad reflection   something as basic as   bottled branded consumer product    A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies    Loaded language again  predator multinationals    An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth    Loaded language biblical phrase    Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis    Loaded question  Why is the question about  theatres or museums and not other publicly funded commercial entities  Because people are more likely to see theaters and museums as being worthy of support  The answer to this question is then assumed to be support for other publicly funded commercial entities not named    Schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory    Loaded question  Seems reasonable at first glance  Now what about home schooling  If classroom attendance were compulsory it would be impossible    All people have their rights but it is better for all of us that different sorts of people should keep to their own kind    Question conflates human rights segregation and cultural diversity  If you disagree here are you disagreeing that all people have their rights or that people should keep to their own kind    There are no savage and civilised peoples there are only different cultures    Conflates  peoples and  cultures into a single question with the aim of getting the test taker to agree that there are no savage and civilized  cultures  this should be two separate questions because the answers to them will be different    A significant advantage of a one party state is that it avoids all the arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system    While the statement is true it also is true that  one party states are often tyrannies that are not at all pleasant to live under  Be careful to what you  Strongly Agree     In a civilised society one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded    Loaded phrasing    Multinational companies are unethically exploiting the plant genetic resources of developing countries    Loaded phrasing and requires knowledge of specific incidents not cited  If knowledge of those incidents is not possessed by the test taker relies on  Multinational companies are unethically exploiting to bias the test taker toward agreeing    Making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity    Loaded phrasing    Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged    Implies that charity and social security are the only two possible methods and forces a choice between them  There are neutral ways to ask these questions that do not bias the test results towards a specific ideology  but that is apparently not the aim of those who created this test    TL DR  The test is biased and thus not a good indicator of anything but the authors leanings     Edit typo 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obama mentions  If I had a son he would look like Trayvon     Obama has to appeal to and play his race card when he is this low in the polls 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve been occasionally checking this site for a couple of years and it s gone through an interesting transformation  This type of comment has always been present but there used to be more reasonable comments too  I think that when Glenn Beck lost his FOX show  this site is basically his news feed  most of his audience went away and left behind a much smaller angrier and more overtly racist population of die hard fans 
PoliticalDiscussion,Amusingly our president just got away with saying  all black men look alike  
PoliticalDiscussion,Short answer not without changing a lot of the laws on how districts are redrawn  There are laws on the books for example that protect  minority majority districts with the specific purpose of ensuring that districts are drawn to ensure those minorities get to choose a representative  When you start drawing districts in ways that make sense from a mathematical standpoint you lose those minority majority districts  The districts drawn in a way that made sense would then be challenged in court and struck down 
PoliticalDiscussion,While I agree with most of what you said You re forgetting about China India and basically the rest of the world which is currently running laps around the US Currently  of the student body of Ivy League schools are not American citizens so even our best schools  and some of the best schools in the world are essentially being outsourced It s actually perfect that you brought up engineering as China graduated over  million engineers last year And guess where the jobs are going to go in the years to come Studying French  Or Mandarin may actually be more realitic than studying engineering in the states in a few decades The US isn t even competitive with the high school graduates it produces I expect this to only get worse at the college level The ironic thing is that the foreign students are the ones truly living the American Dream Coming from backgrounds with much less money working hard coming to America and starting their own companies A lot of Americans just got lazy and began to believe that getting a Bachelors would guarantee a good life like it was back in the s Sorry to say those days are over We live in a global economy now The question isn t whether or not millions of students refuse to pay back their loans the question is what happens if millions of students   can t  pay back their student loans because they don t have jobs that pay them enough to pay back  or   of debt As banks are highly dependent upon student loans this could have staggering consequences for the entire economy Other countries value a highly educated workforce which is why higher education is virtually free throughout much of the industrialized world We Americans like to make money off of education and football stadiums 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess the problem the GP has is with the republican party nomination process then It s a little like the issue of  fair play  It may be in the interests of sportsmen to push the rules to the limit for competitive advantage but it s not wrong to think less of them for breaching the uncodified  spirit of the game   As you said earlier America is unique in having primary elections At the very least that system exists to democratise the system to make its outcomes reflect  the voice of the People  It could be argued that if Paul was using the system in an unconventional way to subvert that democratic ideal for undemocratic purposes it would be worthy of criticism  I think you ve provided a fair defense of what Paul s doing To be honest I think if Paul somehow won through a brokered convention the people should be angry with would be the party establishment not the candidate The party has every right to choose who they want in the election and the country has the chance to vote against their candidate but it s not unreasonable for people to feel disenfranchised if they believe they settled on the wrong one   And is Paul still actually trying to get the nomination or is he just trying to get his message across like normal  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why does scale matter All that matters is where the money is  If and when English speaking countries cease to be the economic powerhouses of the world another language will become favourite 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was really surprised by the President s comments Given his personality and demeanor this is basically an emotional outburst for him I can t actually recall any President saying something quite like this Maybe it s never really come up before but it strikes me as a very raw comment The directness internalization of it is very unusual So I can sort of see why these people are going further off the deep end I m not sure exactly what it means or how people will react to it but I think they do sense it s a sea change of sorts  Something definitely just happened It kind of reminds me of Clinton after the OKC bombing or Bush after   For the vast majority of people I think it s a unifying moment which further isolates the angry uneducated white males who hate his man so much 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a matter of scale  Those languages were only important in limited areas whereas English today dominates world trade

PoliticalDiscussion,If the government stops backing them the risk would go up which would lead to an increase in costs  Also a lot more people would be turned down for loans 
PoliticalDiscussion,So what would it take for the government to stop backing them 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s my understanding from the data I ve seen Did you just make some shit up 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the Democratic Party is particularly worried about social issues at this stage in the game Abortion is the one enduring hotspot that doesn t seem to have shifted much in public opinion lately that will probably be true for awhile But on most other issues  contraception and gay marriage for example Democrats are aware that things are trending in their favor  I think the Democratic Party is rightfully more concerned about economic issues That s the defining issue of this election no matter how much the media try to stir up any hubbub about culture wars If the economy continues to improve even if slowly Obama re election and democratic congressional victories look very likely If it relapses that is the only thing that I think will seriously endanger their chances 
PoliticalDiscussion,There will always be people with stupid hyperbolic opinions about literally any issue you can imagine it s not something to really worry about in the grand scheme of things  I m fairly liberal and I have a pretty awful opinion of George W Bush but I still thought it was stupid and needlessly absurd when every single policy decision he made was met with choruses of  Our president is worse than Hitler  from my asinine liberal friends 
PoliticalDiscussion,Trade languages are not really secure ones What happens when the trade moves elsewhere See various European languages in SE Asia and Phoenecian in the Mediterranean 
PoliticalDiscussion,Without any data you arbitrarily stated that the US has much less natural resource per person than the  countries ahead of the US in GDP per hour worked  Now you want to see data

PoliticalDiscussion,not much less than luxemborg
PoliticalDiscussion,In my mind the striking down of Obamacare would effectively make that part of his presidency null and void  I would then disregard it in the upcoming election which would make Obama a better candidate than Santorum and not radically different from Romney 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government should exist almost exclusively for the prevention of breaches in contracts  fraud for example  and in extreme circumstances national defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,This isn t a hypothetical question it s a historical one  It already happened about  years ago  To answer your question the government based outside of Washington DC would have its main goal as sovereignty while the one that was still based in DC would believe itself to be the only legitimate government in what was formerly known as the United States and it would invade the new nation  A war would ensue bringing with it numerous violations of the constitution and we would all be one nation again 
PoliticalDiscussion,Much less per person 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re not even trying anymore 
PoliticalDiscussion, She didn t force him to have sex that was a consensual decision that was made with full knowledge of the risks involved Now there is a fetus that is half the fathers  
PoliticalDiscussion,they don t apply for leases willy nilly  they WANT to drill in a place before requesting access This is foolishness   They are not drilling because they want to keep the price high America is consuming the least amount of gas than in  years Drilling will only send more gas oil as exports to china and more profits for oil companies Not lower prices We already have too much refined gas to stay in America That is why they are shipping it overseas then blame Obama to keep the  money machine working  
PoliticalDiscussion,And she didn t force him to have sex that was a consensual decision that was made with full knowledge of the risks involved Since she s the one carrying the fetus the decision to terminate it  If she so chooses is hers and hers alone and he knew that when he chose to sleep with her 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it doesn t negate the argument you just want it to Just because you  want the man to have the right to determine what a woman does with her body doesn t mean he  has the right  For some reason you refuse to accept that a woman has the right to do with her body what she has a right to do with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the Bales incident judicial process is being followed Bales in in custody at Ft Leavenworth with  counts of murder filed against him awaiting Court Marshall Everything that  can and  should be done in the Bales case  is and  has been done at this point We re only waiting on the results  By contrast the Martin shooting was a gross miscarriage of justice Zimmerman was never arrested no charges have been filed and state and local police have not investigated the incident at least not until the federal government and the FBI got involved  This is the issue in the murder of Trayvon Martin not that he was killed but that nothing was done to bring the killer to justice   It would be inappropriate for the president to insert himself into an ongoing criminal investigation that is proceeding according to the law It is  entirely appropriate for the president to direct the DOJ to step in and pursue an investigation when there is a clear indication that local law enforcement has been negligent     
PoliticalDiscussion,And it s not as if  the  father doesn t know what s going to happen when he had sex with her The reality is when he ejaculates he s  giving up his sperm and whatever consequently happens happens within the confines of the woman s body and THAT is what gives her the right to determine what happens next  If a man has a problem with that he shouldn t sleep with her then should he 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a comparison of having another dictate what goes on in your body for reproductive reasons  It s close enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe the witness is unreliable maybe a fake but at the very least it suggests we shouldn t jump to rash conclusions  Sure Fox has a bias but do you not also think other stations  CNN etc  might too just the other side of the spectrum    gt But I m not going to provide link after link outlining the reality of the situation  Of course  Why provide any actual evidence to back your assertions  If you don t want to face reality that is your problem not mine   gt The idea that minorities are dishing out more abuse than they are receiving is a right wing fantasy   The stats are there  Ignore them if you want   Lastly how am I trolling  Your post is in   political discussions    I didn t think   discussing  some of the issues you raised in your rant  meant I was a troll  If that is what you want you should preface your posts with the following   THIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY OPEN TO THOSE WHO ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH ME  EVERYONE ELSE CAN GET OUT   As to being ashamed of myself why would I be Because I want the whole story before I jump to conclusions  Because I am reluctant to jump on the race baiting bandwagon  Because I use empirical statistics to try and understand what is actually happening in the world around me  Sorry no shame felt 
PoliticalDiscussion,And that s the bottom line he can t carry the fetus baby she can And THAT is what  gives her the right to determine what happens to her body not him 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why should it be the sole decision of the woman to decide whether or not to keep the baby   gt    the father should have equal say in it s development   So to the converse if the mother wants to keep the baby and the father wants it aborted should he be allowed to force that decision or abdicate parental rights and financial support because he  doesn t want a child 
PoliticalDiscussion,He is a politician Of course he s going to take advantage of any situation where he can gain positive PR As far as it being solely for that I d like to think he has a genuine concern about the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox News found a witness who confirms the shooter s defense  Color me shocked  There are probably  witnesses to the shooting as far away as Oklahoma City  But the opinion I wrote does not depend upon the absolute innocence of this individual in the specific case at hand  Maybe Jayvon did react hostilely to the guy who was following him and who then confronted while walking home from the store after buying candy and a soda  Is that supposed to justify him being shot  Race based violence goes far beyond documented street level crime  I m talking about the institutional violence that sees minority neighborhoods patrolled more and certain minority groups sentenced more severely for crimes  It has to do with more inadequate medical care being provided to minorities for the same ailments  It has to do with the increased difficulty of finding a job because of one s skin color  But I m not going to provide link after link outlining the reality of the situation  The idea that minorities are dishing out more abuse than they are receiving is a right wing fantasy     If you want to justify the killing of a  year old kid who died at the hands of an over zealous and possibly disturbed neighborhood watchman feel free  But I think most people are going to take your trolling with a grain of salt  And truly you should be ashamed of yourself  
PoliticalDiscussion,Put this in your pipe and puff on it      btw Downvoted for personal attack
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because his child is being taken from him   He doesn t   have  a child He and the mother have a fetus   a fetus that might become a child if it is allowed to spend nine months as a parasite feeding off its mother The person on whom the fetus feeds is necessarily the one who gets to decide whether it is allowed to feed or not The fact that women serve as hosts rather than men is as you say an accident of nature but we can t pretend the situation is equal when it is not  And before you accuse me of being a baby hater I m a mom and I love my daughter But for nine months she really was a parasite and carrying her took a serious toll on my health The very idea that someone else should be able to force me to do that against my will is so enraging I have difficulty even discussing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,True I did 
PoliticalDiscussion,And there is the womb that is  of the mothers She didn t force him to have sex with her and he was fully aware that a fetus requires a woman s body to grow and not his own 
PoliticalDiscussion,Got a little antagonistic at the end there 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it d be fair that if a woman can abort a kid without the father s consent that a man should be able to insist upon abortion or the mother can forfeit all future child support    That way either parent can drop all obligation without the decision of the other  It s at least fairer than what we have now  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because his child is being taken from him without his consent That seems like a pretty significant punishment to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,He didn t force her to have sex that was a consensual decision that was made with full knowledge of the risks involved Now there is a fetus that is half the fathers 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m British and we have the highest level of sexual freedom in the Western World My ancestors kicked the Puritans out   The old  believe what you wish or go educate yourself I don t care but please also try not to notice I don t actually have any evidence or examples to support my claim isn t very effective in Political Discussion   You re just the liberal version of those who watch Fox News only interested in things that agree with your view point And I say that as a liberal 
PoliticalDiscussion,You hear day to day comments from Obama to the media about the Afghan shooting You are hearing about Trayvon Martin s death It is being sensationalized because it is a single killing that has taken on national news Neither person was famous well known etc I guess you could say because he is a child and it deals with a new law that it is worthy of national constant news   Those are just some counter points to your questions I honestly haven t been looking into either one all that much So I don t really agree with you or disagree Just giving a counter perspective 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes I can see how this is infuriating However I don t see it s relevance to this discussion A man s penis testicles and sperm are his property and as you say in no way affects the woman However a fetus is not the property of the woman it is shared equally between the father and the mother It most definitely would affect the father if the child he helped make and wants to raise was aborted   It would effect the woman even more to force her to keep a child she doesn t want This isn t about the fetus The fetus cannot exist outside of the womb under any circumstances before  weeks or so That s why the Supreme Court used viability as the marker for when a woman can still have an abortion because its HER body  Why should a man s desire to have a child override something so fundamental as a persons control over their body Why does he have the right to say your womb is now under my control and I am going to force you to use it simply because he stuck his dick in her once  A persons body is NOT their property It is them It s the very crux of freedom If a man wants to eat at mcdonalds he doesn t need the written permission of his SO because it might affect her if he gets fat   And this is just arguing about the perfect case where the father actually wants a child What if you have a one night stand and can t remember his name Oh you should be more careful sorry Or what if he hates his ex wife and has no interest in a child he just wants her to be fat and pregnant What happens if he fucked your sister and got the both of your pregnant in secret but hey sorry that  week old clump of cells is his property and you can only control what is inside your womb on his say so enjoy your kids who will be step siblings and also cousins  No a womans body is her own The fact nature made it so only they can carry babies doesn t override that it s just tough shit 
PoliticalDiscussion,When you only read books written by puritans  or their descendants  you only see what they tell you   Believe what you wish or go educate yourself it is of no consequence to me either way  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sometimes accidents and failures happen So if you don t want kids    don t have sex  That would be a good principle to follow unfortunately it s not realistic Even with proper protection pregnancies still may occur My position is not dependent on whether or not the pregnancy was planned The fetus was made by two people and and both of those people should have a say in it s development If the father wants to raise the child it should be delivered How the mother fits into the scenario afterwards may be a complicated issue but a separate issue than this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correlation does not imply causation  Also it s not being sensationalized and you d have to be a cynical bastard to think that the only reason Obama would get behind this cause is for positive PR 
PoliticalDiscussion,Google  Steven Chu get gas prices up to european levels and there should be a bounty of articles talking about this I did this but couldn t pick a good one to show you so I thought I d just give you the source 
PoliticalDiscussion,No you must trust that the master cares for us  He wouldn t spend the money not on us  He loves us 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes I m not debating that Accidents are most definitely a fact of life but if the father wants to keep the baby even if it was not planned then I believe he should be able to regardless of whether or not the mother wants to keep it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That people who earn money benifit from any number of common resources and infrastructure  It s a powerful argument only in the condition that a state was literally the only way to create such resources and infrastructure or the state methods are objectively and universally better at satisfying the desires of the consumer despite having a pay scheme which takes no record of the consumers preferences  Do you have any evidence to support that    If people could voluntarily create such resources then I assume there would be more diversity and experimentation leading to continual improvements as new technology becomes available The state an immoral provider of services  they never asked for consent and they force you to pay whether you use their services or not  but it s also an inferior provider of services compared with free market providers   In the absence of violent denial of options who would people choose one violent inefficient statist program over many firms competing to attract you and make you a repeat customer  Why does the USPS post regular losses in the billions of dollars and have low customer satisfaction while UPS DHS and FedEx post regular profits with high rates of customer satisfaction  We aren t against civilization we were just tired of schools that made learning unenjoyable police that breed fear a military that murders innocents while invading peoples homes and a state that mercantilistically uses violent to protect certain companies from competition 
PoliticalDiscussion, Abortion permission slips would definitely be a bad idea   From an ethical framework we have three main stakeholders the father the mother and the fetus  I m going to assume that if you align heavily with liberal ideologies then you don t believe the fetus is considered a person so we ll avoid that  Then the stakes are between mother and father They both contribute to conceiving the child so you could claim they have equal right to the child that is born However the woman in addition to contributing her eggs also must bear the child This is a huge responsibility and drastically affects her body She has a right to control her body so therefore she has more weight in the abortion decision You can t ignore the fact that she is the one who must carry the child   This is rights ethics You can t just use people as a means to end because people have intrinsic value and rights Compare this to organ donation  I might become ill and really need a kidney and you have two Obviously it would be a burden to take one kidney from you but this is merely a random act of nature that I end up needing a kidney transplant You don t actually need two kidneys but I do need at least one The thing is you have a right to your body and I am not allowed to coerce you for your kidneys because of this right Just because I want something and even though there would be net benefit between us I can t just harvest your organs because there are many potential risks to you and you should have the freedom to decide 
PoliticalDiscussion,So since I live in a state that has a larger population I get less of a voice  How is that good in any sense  States aren t people  States shouldn t have equal power people should 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s always obnoxious to downvote an opinion just because you don t agree with it even though it contributes to and is on topic with the discussion started by the OP  But what is x more obnoxious is not even having the guts to reply and use actual words to explain why you disagree with the opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s pretty simple  In a general election that doesn t use the electoral college every vote counts  In the current system all those votes in a state that gives it s entire electoral vote to the candidate that wins the majority every vote that was for another candidate is not counted at all in the actual election of the president  In a system where everyone just votes and the person with the most votes gets the presidency this doesn t happen  Every vote counts  Also complaining about downvotes is reason enough to downvote alone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Saying that the market will figure out what makes people best off is little more than saying  oh god I hope this works  
PoliticalDiscussion,I would disagree  No language has ever reached the level of importance that English has now and that level of importance creates a certain inertia that would be prohibitively difficult to overtake  It s not just English speaking countries that are important  though they certainly are   English has become the default second language for international affairs and trade nearing  billion speakers  even though there are only  million native speakers   For example it s conceivable  though highly unlikely that the Chinese could overtake the West in economic power but they re still forced to use English because everyone else in the world does  Because it is used worldwide by just about everyone a competing language would have to utterly dominate world trade to a degree that is simply impossible  On top of that there really aren t any other contenders  Spanish speaking countries are too economically weak India has too many languages Russia is nothing like it used to be in economic influence and Chinese is just too damned difficult to learn  particularly written     On a side note everyone learning something like Esperanto would make things so much easier but I doubt that will ever happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,If a woman wants to keep the baby and the father wants to abort it would that be okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,Apples to Oranges Your analogy would only work if you were comparing the vasectomy to a tubectomy  having your  tubes tied   You can t compare it to an abortion because conception has already occurred 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because it s not a baby It s a fetus It s cells dividing inside a woman And what if he says no And she has to carry to full term because someone else has decided she has to Why does the fathers right override hers and force her to do something with her own body 
PoliticalDiscussion,Terrible argument If you hold this belief then you should also believe that men who don t want a child shouldn t be forced to pay for child support if the mother decides to birth it You can t just take the element of humanity out of the equation here If a woman has the right to terminate the birth of a child without the father s consent because it is her body that is birthing it than a man should have the right to do what he pleases with his finances and may not choose to support it 
PoliticalDiscussion,We re not asking the woman to get permission for sterilization Sorry you can t compare the two 
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot to cherrypick a few pieces let me go back and do those for you      gt The posited future we re headed towards mentioned above is a situation of no guarantee of rights In that situation rights  including security are products and services available for purchase The purchase price will not be based on one s ability to pay but like all private corporate product services on a flat price where those who can afford it may purchase it while those who cannot afford it are SOL    If you re truly in support of a system in which there is no guarantee of rights where what we know as rights for all are instead something that may be purchased from the authorities then just say it   And another part you forgot to cherry pick    gt The posited vision of a small number of private entities as the supreme power will ensure the death of the free market The end result will not be significantly different from Russian communism just replace  the Party with  the Corporation  as in the last corporation standing after the final merger    I m not a defender of the current state of government citizen interaction and the current state of our rights I m saying that support of private corporate supremacy is support of a system functionally equivalent to Russian communism Be careful what you wish for   
PoliticalDiscussion,No I agree that was my point This is not a problem that is going to be fixed without protesting in the streets and the threat of civil unrest The people in power are the only ones that have the power to change it and it benefits both parties Hell both parties more often work TOGETHER to gerrymander than against   Basically you d need an outcry larger and more united than any of the campaign finance reform outcries bigger than Citizens United bigger than anti health care bigger than occupy Wall Street  So I guess in effect my point is the same as yours it ain t never gonna change If it does change it ll basically be along with almost the entirety of the electoral system 
PoliticalDiscussion, of the sperm that creates a baby comes from a father  And after the baby is born that entitles a father to be an equal coparent  But pregnancy requires nothing from the father and  from the mother  This entails  months of possible health complications extreme discomfort debilitating morning sickness for some crazy insane hormonal changes not being able to take many medications and having to watch everything you eat  just to name a few  Some women are on bed rest their entire pregnancies  Even with the financial support of the father this could ruin a woman s career and negatively impact her personal relationships  And then there is the emotional toll of carrying another living being inside your body    Men cannot nurture fetuses and until they can if they want a fetus nurtured they need to have the cooperation of someone with a working uterus  Period   No one else can make this decision for a woman and to imply otherwise is tantamount to endorsing slavery in my opinion    If someone tried to legally force me to carry a fetus to term against my will I d search my home medicine cabinet or even my closet for a tool to remove it from my body until it was out  I m a doctor of medical history rather than of the modern practice of medicine but I m confident I d do no worse than a back alley quack  It s my body and it s my uterus and even a man I m married to does not have the right to force me to carry and nurture a life inside of my body for  months against my will

PoliticalDiscussion, gt So this is currently about the best we can do for general principles The mother carrying the baby affecting her health deserves the final say in what happens to her body  Yup yup   gt If a child is born the parents of that child  both  should be held responsible  I think we can do better for general principles   If the father wants nothing to do with the child and has made his position clear to the mother and she still chose to have it I don t see why he should have any responsibilities 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My point is that the fact that women can get pregnant and men can t is merely a consequence of nature Neither party has any control over that fact so why should the father be punished for it  Why do you think the father is being punished This seems like the crux of your argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ugh tell me about it I m currently going to CUNY Queens College the price every semester has gone up  at least  While it may not seem like a lot there are a ton of kids who go there who are in the working and lower middle class and  dollars is huge They say  all money is now directly going to CUNY  though   but we ll see about that once the budget actually goes through this year   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My point is that the fact that women can get pregnant and men can t is merely a consequence of nature  It s not a  consequence of anything It s called biology   gt However a fetus is not the property of the woman it is shared equally between the father and the mother  So father owns the mothers womb too Where do you draw the line How much control should one adult have over the body of another adult I honestly have no idea what you re proposing Should we lock the mother up and put her on suicide watch so she doesn t throw herself down some stairs or ingest some quicksilver or seek out a discredited doctor with a coat hangar There are plenty of ways to end a pregnancy that don t require an permission slip from daddy   gt In one case we re talking about potential children and in another we are talking about an actual child  No in both cases I m talking about one adult requiring the consent of another adult for a medical procedure You are mistaking a fetus for a child Until that fetus is viable it s essentially a parasite and the mother is the host   gt Again you re being very callous towards the feelings of the father  Your fathers emotions argument is baseless since you don t even take the mothers emotions into consideration   gt To say that a father should not feel any of that and just replace his lost child with another one like one would a broken bicycle is extremely insensitive  And yet you propose a scenario so insensitive to women that they are treated as little more than a vessel for bearing children at a fathers discretion

PoliticalDiscussion,While I cannot argue quite as articulate as you can I want you to know that I support your position you are not alone I also have socialist views 
PoliticalDiscussion,Almost makes up for killing the middle class s access to quality public education 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have not seen any statistic on the number of times this has been an issue but I would not be surprised to see that it is a rather high amount   My only real issue with a law like this is that it would mean that the government would be forcing individuals to go through some pretty serous medical operations regardless of what that individual desires 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree In a rare form of agreement the Republicans and Democrats in the state have exchanged favors to keep their jobs I do like what Cuomo did though   he knew he couldn t get redistricting passed now no matter what   so he made it so future generations of politicians now face more of a challenge Good guy governor   
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just going to disagree for the sake of it here   Public financing has the problem of taxpayer money going towards a candidate that all taxpayers do not endorse Why should my tax payer money go towards a candidate s campaign who I don t support   I can see some problems with alternative voting mainly the viability of it actually ever passing The entire process would take a constitutional amendment and a whole reworking of the electoral system None of that is as  sexy as say abortion or gun rights The public as well as elected officials simply wouldn t care enough   In many states the judiciary is elected and made of D s and R s as well And let s face it although judiciaries are supposed to be impartial to the political process we all know they are not   However I would like to say that I actually completely agree with you and wish the public cared about the electoral process   
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it takes two to tango  Thing is the mother has a much greater stake in what happens before birth After the birth both parents should and do So yes Before birth especially early term when it s a fetus and not a human with human rights the mother should have the final say In theory of course the father should have input  but it s the mother s body When the baby is born two parents are responsible  And it s not always fair and it doesn t always work out right How many times in the past centuries has the father walked off even if it was known who the father was Mother was screwed  har har then Even now it happens enough  and don t give me the  mother sleeping around means she s a slut bullshit since men and women both commonly have multiple partners over time So the point it that it happens and would happen in reverse if the sexes were switched  So this is currently about the best we can do for general principles The mother carrying the baby affecting her health deserves the final say in what happens to her body If a child is born the parents of that child  both  should be held responsible unless a court for example awards custody to one or the other  and I m a firm believer that both should have equal chances before whatever circumstances are taken into account   And you say  Yet the man is responsible like the woman isn t They both are  Lessons   Don t have unprotected sex if you don t want kids  Sometimes accidents and failures happen So if you don t want kids    don t have sex 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If the man wants a child he must find a woman who is willing to carry and birth the child Simple as that  No it s not as simple as that One night stands gone wrong divorces that occur while a woman is pregnant accidental pregnancies for married couples at an inopportune time for the wife    I could go on all day listing situations that may result in a mother wanting an abortion after consensual sex while the father does not I believe that negates the rest of your argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is that redistricting is one of the few times that both parties work together in order to keep their jobs A perfect example is in Western NY where the cities of Rochester and Buffalo both fall into one federal district and then the suburbs between the two cities compose another district So there is one district that will always be won by the Democrat incumbent and another one barring a sex scandal will get won by the Republican incumbent While abortions and gay marriage cause tensions they all just want to keep their jobs and will help each other out with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no such thing as  effective contraception Accidents happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,No the difference between having civil servant soldiers and contract hire soldiers is one of accounting not substance 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m inclined to agree with that view Nevertheless it doesn t negate the fact that situation such as this occur probably more frequently than one would imagine and at least in my opinion it is inherently unfair for a child to be aborted if either the mother or father is accepting of the responsibility of raising that child 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately our winner take all system makes it near impossible for any third party to win Unless a   massive  movement took place where people would vote en masse for a third party it wouldn t work It would have to start locally if anything as it would cost much less money and be much easier to mobilize voters towards a third party candidate 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In Finland there are no Private schools   This is not true  There are privately run schools in finland but they operate like charter schools in the US  More importantly US school dysfunction is greatly exaggerated  The single largest fact in education is that there are large and persistent racial disparities  Why this is the case is controversial but that it is the case is not  If you break the US down by race we are near the top 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not as if the mother didn t know the risks of pregnancy when she had sex If a mature person decides that he she is ready to engage in sexual intercourse but does not wish for it to result in a pregnancy than it is his her responsibility to make sure that the proper precautions are in place to prevent the pregnancy from starting That goes equally for men and women 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately in New York   the governor succumbed to political pressure and is allowing the gerrymandering process He made it his campaign promise not to and he broke it    However  he did make part of the deal that the next time redistricting happens and independent commission will be set up So the crooks in the Assembly and the Senate got what they wanted currently but whoever is there ten years from now will no longer have the power    which is definitely better 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yet the man is responsible for it for eighteen years 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m kind of hoping for evolution towards direct democracy too We have all the necessary parts to make it work except perhaps for a politically engaged population with sufficient background education  civics and sufficient access to accurate information news to make decisions with the knowledge of how to not get duped by misinformation  faux news The US is likely doomed due to the deficiencies listed but some European nations seem like they have chance   If one were to visualize the historical pattern of succession from one power structure to another whenever a rising group that has been on the rise for over a century takes over as supreme a brand new group is emerging beneath them that will be the next to take over   Looking back notice that the founders and founding influencers of our current power structure  Jefferson Adam Smith spoke on the dangers posed by corporations and collusion of private interests those corporations and private economic players proved to be the undoing of the current system Looking back to the previous system of hereditary oligarchy non title holding people made fortunes and when combined with the views that emerged during the Englightenment leveraged their fortunes to create a new power structure where  the people reigned supreme No coincidence that George Washington was the richest man on the continent and yet was not in the Peerage Washington s role then is somewhat similar to the role of the Koch Brothers today differing in what vision they are bringing into reality When the system of Peerage  hereditary oligarchy became supreme from either the power of an absolute monarch or the power of the Catholic Church people like Washington were beginning to make and accumulate fortunes made in trade and business yet were not yet near the reins of power   So in our time a group that is new and innovative with a different kind of power that is not measured or valued in the system that is becoming supreme as we speak  they will eventually be the creators of the system after the nightmare we re only entering now I m thinking it ll be the type of people who can create and control mobs through use of the internet fueled by a philosophy that is currently in its infancy will ultimately fill the role that Washington once held and the Koches now hold The internet as we know it will surely die soon but the social transformation it created cannot be put back in the bottle Think about all the effort that a billion people put into the internet done not for money  but for something else  From  that will be the undoing of corporate private supremacy    There is no  end of history or  permanent with manmade power structures so in that there is hope   EDIT clarity
PoliticalDiscussion,Proportional representation everywhere seems to be the answer to gerrymandering   the only thing is that it seems to counter to American culture and tradition Using proportional representation technically everyone  wins  unless they don t get past the voter threshold  contrary to the American tradition of the individual candidate and a successful winner and a failing loser 
PoliticalDiscussion,Since the biological burden is on the woman she has more biological rights If the man wants a child he must find a woman who is willing to carry and birth the child Simple as that The man is of course free to make a private arrangement with the woman to carry and birth the baby and she will legally surrender all rights to it afterwards The agreement can even be made legally binding through contract if both parties wish it to be   I suppose the closest parallel might be a sick man who needs and refuses a living saving operation His wife cannot legally force him to have the operation even though she could prove that his premature death will cause her to lose wealth   of his income for example She might very much want the wealth but biologically the choice is his to make Legally it is established that the wife does have a legal claim to his income Much in the same way the man would have a legal claim on the child in the abortion question but biological rights supersede in both cases 
PoliticalDiscussion,But there is already a child in the question and the father wants to raise it It is not simply a question of just getting another one if there s already a child in the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,While this serves the purpose of making it impartial and not causing voter dilution through unequal population it can cause minorities to be disenfranchised through splitting Simply drawing a line based upon the shortest route could easily cut through minority dense communities in urband areas and inherently end up making their vote useless 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s arguable that most of the financial burden can be taken on by the child s father but he can t take on the other responsibilities  Exactly the father could not take on those burdens even if he  wanted to So why should a consequence of nature get in the way of a father being able to raise his child   gt Getting hit by lightning is a random act of nature getting pregnant isn t  My point is that the fact that women can get pregnant and men can t is merely a consequence of nature Neither party has any control over that fact so why should the father be punished for it   gt Now one of them has  of the burden of bringing a child to term so she should have  of the decision whether or not to  You re being very callous about this and acting as if the father has no emotions at all Yes pregnancy is a potentially dangerous and very serious undertaking for women but the man is not responsible for that fact nature is The result of that pregnancy however is a child that is equally the father s and the mother s if a father wants to raise his child and love it and see it grow how in any stretch of the imagination is it  equal for a mother to take that child away from him   gt There are instances of men seeking vasectomies required  by no legal obligation mind you by their doctor to get a signed note from their wife first Imagine how infuriating as a competent adult it must be for another adult to have to give the OK before a doctor can preform a procedure that in no way affects them  Yes I can see how this is infuriating However I don t see it s relevance to this discussion A man s penis testicles and sperm are his property and as you say in no way affects the woman However a fetus is not the property of the woman it is shared equally between the father and the mother It most definitely would affect the father if the child he helped make and wants to raise was aborted   In one case we re talking about  potential children and in another we are talking about an  actual child There is a world of difference between the two   gt If he wants to be a dad so badly he can adopt there are already enough unwanted children carried to term who need a home  Again you re being very callous towards the feelings of the father Would you tell a mother who just experienced a miscarriage and was feeling emotionally distraught about it to  suck it up and adopt another child  Most of the time parents don t want to raise just any child they want to raise  their child the one who carries their DNA who looks like them who they feel a biological connection to To say that a father should not feel any of that and just replace his lost child with another one like one would a broken bicycle is extremely insensitive 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am most certainly not saying that I am saying that there are risks involved which can be more severe depending on certain condition such as wealth  My personal view is that if the government is going to use its considerable resources and force I d rather it be spent preventing the need for abortion in the first place 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the Republican position has nothing whatsoever to do with facts and everything to do with hating and blaming the opposition Absent that they have utterly nothing to run on and bitch about 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And yes the mother must carry the baby but the father has no say in that He couldn t carry the baby if he wanted to  You ve just answered your own question It s not the father s health body and well being at risk The father has risked only the one time deposit of sperm The potential mother risks health life job possibly family and friends etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,And if a man wants to have a child there are other options as well  adoption surrogate mothers etc    There is no need to force one particular woman through a pregnancy she doesn t want 
PoliticalDiscussion,That   isn t treason Treason is actively working to hinder the government He hindered the government but only as a byproduct of his actions 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s my point  No man would ever go along with that situation  So why would women go along with  abortion permission slips  
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not a counter example at all If the woman doesn t want to get pregnant she simply must choose either to abstain from having sex with her partner or only do so using contraception Forcing a man to get a vasectomy would be one possible solution to the problem but certainly not the only one  In your situation the couple is discussing the prospect of having children in the future  prior to the pregnancy actually occurring In my situation the pregnancy  resulting from consensual sex is already in action and the father would very much like to be able to raise his child So again why should the mother be able to take that child away from him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where in the media has there been any strong discussion that runs counter to the Democratic line on gay marriage contraception or affirmative action  On each of these issues the MSM is absolutely in agreement with the Democratic party  A tinderkeg it is not 
PoliticalDiscussion,The current situation  in theory is a guarantee of state protected rights regardless of one s ability to pay in exchange for a mandatory payment based on one s ability to pay OMFG tyranny of taxes I know   The posited future we re headed towards mentioned above is a situation of  no guarantee of rights In that situation rights  including security are products and services available for purchase The purchase price will  not be based on one s ability to pay but like all private corporate product services on a flat price where those who can afford it may purchase it while those who cannot afford it are SOL   The posited future is  not a libertarian vision although it has a facade of that You can only hope that you can afford the fee for your nd amendment permit your fee for the right to remain silent and your fee for the right to a trial and not detention for life without a trial Should your private employer cheat you out of your earned wages you can only hope the private court to sue them in isn t a subsidiary of your employer and that you can afford the fees for the service of using the court  in addition to lawyer fees  You can only hope that private entity the FDA becomes a branch of does not have a profit motive in lowering food and drug inspection standards And that s the world for people with lucrative employment and the ability to pay no matter how high the fee That s the good news   The bad news is that the federal oversight required to ensure a free market with competition  will not exist when the state is not the supreme entity This is already fading evidenced by the growing power of corporations over small businesses the growing role of IP copyright lawsuits by older wealthier businesses to stifle competition from newer less wealthy challengers increasing corporate conglomeration where fewer entities are controlling a greater percentage of market share in various industries if not an increase in monopolies  ex local ISPs in many parts of the country  The posited vision of a small number of private entities as the supreme power will ensure the death of the free market The end result will not be significantly different from Russian communism just replace  the Party with  the Corporation  as in the last corporation standing after the final merger 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you re saying that a mother should have the sole decision making power over the fetus because she is the one that must carry the child But how is that fair The father  in cases that apply to my argument didn t force the mother to get pregnant and certainly has no say in who gets to carry the child 
PoliticalDiscussion,But what if he wasn t as innocent as you assume  This  source   suggests that Zimmerman may have been acting in self defense  Should you not wait until all the facts are out before stating how innocent he was  Maybe he was acting in self defense  As to race based violence the reality is that inter race violence rates in the US are quite low  Figure  in  this   Justice department document shows that blacks usually kill blacks and whites usually kill whites  The intra racial violence rates are very low but even there blacks kill whites more often than whites kill blacks   You might consider perusing the entire pdf in teh link above as the actual evidence runs counter to pretty much everything you say 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fathers are forced to pay child support for children they don t want all the time why should it be different for mothers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please read the whole post before commenting I explicitly say that I am only talking about cases of consensual sex  And yes the mother must carry the baby but the father has no say in that He couldn t carry the baby if he wanted to 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt However I certainly wouldn t agree with discouraging poor women from getting pregnant in any other case so why should it be different here   There is a bit of a difference between a women making the decision and continuing to make that decision every day to accept the risks involved vs someone a woman being forced to accept them every single day by the government 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why should it be the sole decision of the woman to decide whether or not to keep the baby  Because she s the one that has the financial social physical medical and mental responsibilities to carry a child to term It s arguable that most of the financial burden can be taken on by the child s father but he can t take on the other responsibilities   gt Obviously it would be a burden for the woman because she is the one that must carry the child until delivery but this is merely a random act of nature  Getting hit by lightning is a random act of nature getting pregnant isn t It s a byproduct of an intentional act of adults Now one of them has  of the burden of bringing a child to term so she should have  of the decision whether or not to   gt If the father wants to raise his child how is it right for the would be mother to take that child away from him  Because the father might have rights to the child but he has no rights over the woman who has to carry it to term  There are instances of men seeking vasectomies required  by no legal obligation mind you by their doctor to get a signed note from their wife first Imagine how infuriating as a competent adult it must be for another adult to have to give the OK before a doctor can preform a procedure that in no way affects them If he wants to be a dad so badly he can adopt there are already enough unwanted children carried to term who need a home 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see how this is a counter example What if men had to get  vasectomy permission slips  
PoliticalDiscussion,Why should someone be forced to pay child support for a baby they didn t want especially if they re the mother 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very good 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Another much more powerful argument in favour is that that people do no earn money in isolation   There is a very potent lie implicitly embedded here The lie is that taxation is a form of cooperation or that taxation is required for cooperation  This is clearly false in both counts  First taxation is not cooperation and we know this because we can  observe that the taxman needs to threaten people who refuse to pay tax with punishment  If taxation really was cooperation people would willfully pay it and the punishment would not be necessary  Second with or without taxation people will get together and peacefully cooperate to achieve their goals  Everything that can be accomplished through spending the loot of mass theft can be accomplished  and  better  by people cooperating among each other  In other words your argument is a non sequitur  It simply does not follow in any way that because people earn money by cooperating each other taxation is necessary  This is false  I highly suggest you should not believe it or propagate it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The best thing to keep them in line is an armed populace second best is a piece of paper that is supposedly enforced by the courts third best is voters and it drops off quickly after that 
PoliticalDiscussion,The father doesn t carry the baby the mother does  Also cases of rape 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well think about the counter example  A couple is together and the woman decides she no longer wants to have kids  Does she have the right to force the man to get a vasectomy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes of course there are risk factors I think I ve heard a statistic that before modern medicine a majority  or near majority of pregnant women died in childbirth I don t have a source for that but I definitely agree that there are risks involved  However I certainly wouldn t agree with discouraging poor women from getting pregnant in any other case so why should it be different here My point is that regardless of socioeconomic status or the presence of other risks this child is the product of  two people s DNA and they both should have their feelings considered equally in decisions involving said child If the mother doesn t want it fine make her pay child support like a father would have to and she can walk away clean from the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,But why should she have the right to if the father wanted the child The baby is not the  mother s child  it is equally the mother s  and the father s Why is his opinion worth so much less than the mothers 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obviously it would be a burden for the woman because she is the one that must carry the child until delivery but this is merely a random act of nature  Pregnancy is more than a random act of nature and for those who don t get live nice cushy lives they can be rather serious  Questionable quality source        Even worse   
PoliticalDiscussion,The answer to your specific case is that your employer manages you poorly This is however no rationale to change country economic policy by law The solution is to get a better job   
PoliticalDiscussion,How can something  belong to everyone  If not everyone agrees how a resource should be used who gets to decide The majority So suddenly not everyone owns it just the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,A good question Probably the people who were there in the first place What claim did the state have in that property And why is it any stronger to the claim of any others 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok who did own the land and what claim did they have to it over others 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Will we soon move to a position where we all have shares in security companies and will need to buy our security rather than have it as a guarenteed human and civil right  What is a  guaranteed human and civil right to you These people aren t doing it out of the goodness of their hearts if the police weren t paid you wouldn t get protection from the government either The only difference is you aren t allowed to  not pay them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hownthe heck did you get on the plane
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yeah but I personally don t care if you would be personally better off buying these things privately They are not private now and you are using them  Does the slave consent to being enslaved because he gets free food and lodging This is an incredibly weak argument   gt Aside from the separate theoretical debate we are having You are not being robbed You are being billed  Same goes for the slave   gt  Any idiot with a gun isn t really enforcing the law in the sense that I understand it Truly enforcing law requires a degree of professional standards and accountability   Anybody getting a paycheck has the capacity to be professional and accountable   gt Transparency in one s actions and the standards by which decisions are taken  Something a law enforcement company might benefit from   gt Furthermore  polycentric law from what reading I ve done seems like a very minor academic subset of legal theory If you have examples of how this system has existed in a sustained and just manor without the presence of a state then by all means I d like to hear it  Free Commonwealth period is one of the most famous if you want to read more on the theory you can         gt It s telling that you ve only used financial services examples Examples where the desirability of a product is pretty much much fixed to it s cost of manufacture  gt You didn t ask  not sign up to a service that will get you any film on  demand  or  why not sign up to a service where some one will bring you pizza at any time  or  why not hire someone who would let you do anything to them for a set period of time  These services exist because it s possible to add value without directly adding monetary cost whither it be by using their expertise in finding films willingness to make pizza at a moment s notice or willingness to be used  You are misunderstanding the argument if you believe a   pizza delivery service is the same as a policing service which allows you to violate property rights at will The reason  why i used the insurance and loan industries as examples is because one stands to  lose money from simply allowing criminals to run rampant They have a vested interest in actively preventing that very thing from occurring Criminals won t be the ones hiring policing agencies for anything other than personal protection you can t hire an agency to  not enforce the law against you it won t be up to any single entity If your agency declares it won t enforce the law against you the outcome would be that agency losing money because it s own patrons are being robbed by other patrons or the more likely outcome you will be arrested by somebody else s agency since they would be completely external to this deal they d have no reason to simply allow you to go free unless there s a business model which is meant to attract customers by failing to do the job you ve hired them for You might too also bring up bribery at the low local level  police themselves  which the state is not immune from   gt If there was a situation where policing was truly privatized  ie there was no state oversight of the industry then the most effective efficient and attractive business model would be that of a set of hired thugs Think this guy robbed your house I ll catch beat kill him for   It s how mafia turf wars start It s how war lords build there empire It s how things happen in the absence of a state backed legal system  What is so magical about this entity you call the government which institutes all logic and morality among men I don t understand it I really don t If what you ve said was true why isn t everyone in society doing this exact thing right now There s really nothing other than  the single competing agency  the police stopping people from doing this right now Other agencies wouldn t simply allow other agencies to kill people haphazardly If we re going to get into how this issue is resolved its another matter arbitration That can also be private Despite your assertion bloodshed is not at all the cheapest way to resolve conflict between these organizations What s cheaper constant death resulting in loss of labor and a smaller recruitment pool  who wants to work for a company where you can be killed at any moment   cost of weapons and so on or paying a small arbitration fee at an independent arbitration office to settle the matter   gt Well I m not  buying justice  When my bike was stolen I didn t have the option of getting my case fast tracked by paying extra to the police  They re already being paid for communally it is still a monopoly and they re still being paid 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No the analogous example is that the prisoner consents to his imprisonment because he lived on a land which had laws and benifited from them  Where can he go Another prison which does the same thing  Furthermore it assumes an original position but that original position is contrary to history One which land is owned by the state and the individual is merely allowed to live on it Whose property was the land where the first state emerged It was private  and not the state  There are other criticisms but I don t want to confuse you or give you a tiny glimpse of light known as complexity for you to escape and try to save face Social contract theory is morally and intellectually bankrupt It was an after the fact justification for aggression and violence 
PoliticalDiscussion,More supply cheaper you can sell the product Got it flood the market with supply the price drops  If only we had more oil more refined gas  more refineries a higher supply of gas then oil companies would have more than current demand and start to flood the American market with cheap gas right    instead  fungibility of gas  oil companies lowering prices once they have  excess gas  more supply like they should they keep prices at home high and ship the surplus to china and Latin America What in this don t   YOU  understand    new regulations under national security are required      NEW YORK  AP  For the first time the top export of the United States the world s biggest gas guzzler is  wait for it  fuel  Measured in dollars the nation is on pace this year to ship more gasoline diesel and jet fuel than any other single export according to U S Census data going back to  It will also be the first year in more than  that America has been a net exporter of these fuels    The volume of fuel exports is rising The U S is using less fuel because of a weak economy and more efficient cars and trucks That allows refiners to sell more fuel to rapidly growing economies in Latin America for example   In  U S refiners exported  million gallons per day of gasoline  diesel jet fuel and other petroleum products up from  million gallons per day a decade earlier      There s at least one domestic downside to America s growing role as a fuel exporter Experts say the trend helps explain why U S motorists are paying more for gasoline The more fuel that s sent overseas the less of a supply cushion there is at home    Gasoline supplies are being exported to the highest bidder says Tom Kloza chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service  It s a world market  he says  Refining companies won t say how much they make by selling fuel overseas But analysts say those sales are likely generating higher profits per gallon than they would have generated in the U S Otherwise they wouldn t occur  The value of U S fuel exports has grown steadily over the past decade coinciding with rising oil prices and increased demand around the globe  Developing countries in Latin America and Asia have been burning more gasoline and diesel as their people buy more cars and build more roads and factories Europe also has been buying more U S fuel to make up for its lack of refineries  And there s a simple reason why America s refiners have been eager to export to these markets gasoline demand in the U S has been falling every year since  It dropped by another  percent in  With the economy struggling motorists cut back Also cars and trucks have become more fuel efficient and the government mandates the use of more corn based ethanol fuel  The last time the U S was a net exporter of fuels was  when Harry Truman was president That year the U S exported  million barrels and imported  million barrels In the first ten months of  the nation exported  million barrels  worth   billion and imported  million barrels 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the airline is robbing me when they ask for me to pay for my ticket before I get off the plane at me destination 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you ve ever voted on a tax related issue that s exactly what you did 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea is that government spending is inherently inefficient but that tax cuts all more efficient private sector spending which means the US as a whole benefits even if the gov t has a tight budget 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who made society before taxes Would the very first tax dollar be justified Bills of payment only can be incurred from something the tax dollars did so if there were no taxes before that what service could the debt be for 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well define it however you want just understand no one else respects your arbitrary definition 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it s mine I think it belongs to everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes it yours 
PoliticalDiscussion,Aint no one else was usin it
PoliticalDiscussion,What about fraud Is that ever moral 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hey OP everyone is the product of our parents  does that mean parents get to dictate their wishes over their progeny s bodies 
PoliticalDiscussion,The number of native speakers doesn t really matter  English as a native tongue is only as significant as the United States and the Commonwealth which hold weight only so long as their economies remain disproportionately strong  The real important factor is all the other countries who utilize English as a mass secondary language particularly Subsaharan Africa and India  This adds a couple  billion speakers which puts English in a category of its own in terms of importance  You make comparisons to Latin and other older languages but you re missing my main point  Those languages were only used in limited geographical areas  English today fills a position never held by any language in history before  No language has ever been so universally used in trade international affairs education and so many other fields  Overtaking it is prohibitively difficult because the world has subconsciously agreed that it is now the standard language of international  and often subnational relations  Whether or not native English speaking countries remain dominant doesn t really matter because everyone else has already adopted English anyway  English beat all other languages in the race to dominate world affairs and it s simply unlikely that any other language can unseat it  Would Chinese become the language taught to primary schoolchildren in Uganda or Bangladesh  Highly unlikely and until it does world trade will still be conducted in the only language spoken by such a huge quantity of people English  Even if China  or other countries though China seems the most likely candidate is able to achieve some sort of economic and geopolitical parity with the United States it will probably still conduct its international dealings in English because the rest of the world does so  And so long as the Chinese are forced to use English there is no incentive for anyone else to learn Chinese  notwithstanding the rather high difficulty level of doing so  
PoliticalDiscussion,You forgot to delete one
PoliticalDiscussion,What else would it be  And why shouldn t the definition change depending on where you live  the definition of appropriate dress or modesty certainly changes it different places  That definition was drawn as the parallel to murder which is unlawful killing  Killing is sometimes moral sometimes not but it s only murder when it s against the law  Taking somebody s property is sometimes moral generally not but it s only theft when it violates the law  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Prices WILL NOT DROP as we are already using less gas than we have int he past  You seriously need to go find an introductory economics textbook This is just basic supply and demand 
PoliticalDiscussion,OP obviously has empathy issues See the edit to his original comment   gt My response to this is that the medical component is not entirely relevant since the father had no say in who gets to carry the child Also in cases of consensual sex the mother knew the risks of pregnancy prior to engaging in intercourse and to play the blame game afterwards is unfair Accidents happen but if that accidents results in a fetus that belongs to both a mother and a father the father should have equal say in it s development Also the prospect of having a child equally impacts the father s professional life and life in general especially if he was to be a single parent as in cases relevant to this discussion so to say that the pregnancy only affects the mother is biased and inaccurate  Sex is consensual but because men can t carry a baby so its OK for us to impose our will on women Fathers get  equal say in having a child even if it means disregarding the woman s decision 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can meaningful justice be achieved through non state backed law enforcement 
PoliticalDiscussion,the more they drill the more they will export   Prices WILL NOT DROP as we are already using less gas than we have int he past   They have extra oil already instead of lowering the price and selling here they export for profit Having MORE oil will only increase this process and their profits not lower prices at home Drill crowd is wrong   Regulations are the only way to control the oil companies for national security OR drill and watch our oil go to china Unless you like China more   
PoliticalDiscussion,how is a state any state a system that guarantees rights  for the rest of human history  
PoliticalDiscussion,How it is central to their views  You ve made the claim but you haven t actually backed it up  And why are they not protesting tubal ligation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would be perfectly willing to accept that racism causes blacks to be prosecuted more  But even if you accept that racism causes them to be prosecuted  times as much far more than I think possible blacks would still be killing whites at more than double the rate of the reverse 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is insane Canada is rationing health care Ummm no  Nationalized health care gets rationed i e the UK But not single payer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yup that s totally what I m saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,What makes it your lawn 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Conservatives were against freedom or promiscuity or whatever and women were simply  in the line of fire this time around that would be one thing but the evidence doesn t support your descriptions  Controlling women s sexuality is CENTRAL to the  overall views of the anti contraception anti choice crowd  That s why it s a war on women  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So if we have a revenue problem  like so many opponents of the Bush tax cuts seem to think then why aren t we looking to end the tax cuts for the middle and lower class as well  The goal is not to reduce the deficit The goal is to get re elected and to do that you can t piss off the middle class by raising their taxes in an election year 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the argument can be made that repealing those Bush era tax cuts on the middle class wouldn t really do much considering that a lot of that money is getting spent and funneled back into the economy The rich have shown that they are largely hoarding the money not putting it back into the economy via spending or hiring 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt they don t apply for leases willy nilly  they WANT to drill in a place before requesting access This is foolishness  They also don t want someone else to drill in that place   gt They are not drilling because they want to keep the price high  That s stupid Outside of the OPEC oil cartel all producers have a direct incentive to increase their profits by increasing their production Under no circumstance would they become less profitable by producing more  ignoring exploration set up costs   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But you did you stated that since I benefit from government infrastructure  Yeah but I personally don t care if you would be personally better off buying these things privately They are not private now and you are using them Aside from the separate theoretical debate we are having You are not being robbed You are being billed   gt I suggest you pick up a history book  Well my history books are pretty long and most of them contradict each other to some extent So it ll probs take me a while to find the instances that you are talking about What exactly do you think I should read about   gt Well ignoring that any idiot with a gun and a stick could actually enforce the law covering policing in itself there s many instances in history where polycentric law  yeah it s a thing has provided all of the things you ve mentioned   Any idiot with a gun isn t really enforcing the law in the sense that I understand it Truly enforcing law requires a degree of professional standards and accountability Transparency in one s actions and the standards by which decisions are taken As well as clarity in terms of  what authority one has to enforce law  Furthermore  polycentric law from what reading I ve done seems like a very minor academic subset of legal theory If you have examples of how this system has existed in a sustained and just manor without the presence of a state then by all means I d like to hear it If not don t try to patronize me you re making your self sound like an idiot    gt Why not sign up to an insurance company that covers everything Why not sign up for a bank that doesn t expect to be repaid  It s telling that you ve only used financial services examples Examples where the desirability of a product is pretty much much fixed to it s cost of manufacture   You didn t ask  not sign up to a service that will get you any film on  demand  or  why not sign up to a service where some one will bring you pizza at any time  or  why not hire someone who would let you do anything to them for a set period of time  These services exist because it s possible to add value without directly adding monetary cost whither it be by using their expertise in finding films willingness to make pizza at a moment s notice or willingness to be used  If it were legal  in fact even despite it s illegality it s not  wouldn t be hard to find people willing to execute whatever you consider justice for a reasonable fee A policy which said  we will totally disregard the interests of others in their dealings with you would not necessarily be higher to the company than one which guaranteed an element of fact finding or fair treatment of both parties in a dispute  If there was a situation where policing was truly privatized  ie there was no state oversight of the industry then the most effective efficient and attractive business model would be that of a set of hired thugs Think this guy robbed your house I ll catch beat kill him for    It s how mafia turf wars start It s how war lords build there empire It s how things happen in the absence of a state backed legal system   gt You re already  buying justice  except it s a monopoly  Well I m not  buying justice  When my bike was stolen I didn t have the option of getting my case fast tracked by paying extra to the police I can t pay extra every month for the privilege of getting priority service I can t pay the police not to investigate me Furthermore the police act on terms which are dictated to them by democratically elected and accountable structures  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Whatever I m not going to argue semantics with you The point is that it s uncontrollable  Ok I ve got it Men contribute  of the DNA therefore we get  of the decision to legally force her to carry a baby to term against her will So basically  months of physical and emotional torture is OK for her so long as us dads don t feel bad because we got our hopes up   gt No he partly owns the fetus inside of her  Then if she doesn t want it he can have it   gt I draw the line when her womb is no longer occupied by an organism that is partly someone else s  A womb isn t a rental property at some zoning hearing I don t understand why you have a hard time understanding this You don t have a say Just because men can t carry babies doesn t mean we get to impose  months of emotional rape on another person  How healthy do you think this poor lady is going to be when it s all over Think she ll ever be capable of a normal relationship What about PTSD or any other emotional or mental damage Who cares at least we get to be a dad now Not like we ever has to concern ourselves with mom ever again  Just out of morbid curiosity since you re so keen on men getting the final say in pregnancy what s your opinion on men being able to legally force a woman to get an abortion even though they want to keep the baby 
PoliticalDiscussion,Try  trillion in three years     
PoliticalDiscussion,You re totally right we should end all of the Bush tax cuts not just those on the rich  The deficit cannot be reasonably reduced in any other way  The reason that raising taxes on the rich is so popular is that most people would rather that more money be raised in taxes but not actually pay more in taxes themselves  The same motivation drives cigarette taxes  However most people who are proponents of this do not claim that this is their motivation  They claim that their motivation is  the greater good   They want the rich to pay their fair share  without ever defining what exactly that is     It is easy to be a proponent of this greater good because it requires nothing of the person who supports it and it makes them feel good about themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,No matter how powerful a language is it s fortunes ebb and tide Latin once had the same role in Europe as late as the th century It s gone   You know the number of native speakers for English is not growing right English is a global second language but the number of people who pass it on to their children is much smaller it s certainly less than half a billion The only reason why it s such a popular language is because of certain conditions Take those conditions away and there s no  reason for it to retain its popularity   A competing nation doesn t have to dominate the world economy in order to disrupt English s place as the lingua franca it just has to be competitive so as to produce a bilingual or multilingual environment 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not a universal definition The definition can t change depending on when and where you live Your basically just saying  theft is whatever   the law  defines it to be  
PoliticalDiscussion,I find it interesting that Liberals and Leftists don t care about the rights of the human life they class as undesirable It just goes to show they are not protectors of the weak and totally defenseless    Physical stages of human life  I think the Liberals and Left are sick in the head and or just evil in destroying innocent and defenseless life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes and no  In a completely fair system where everyone is treated equally and people were neither discriminated against nor given preferential treatment based on race or other minority status I d agree  Historically we haven t had that  The laws are on the books specifically because districts were being gerrymandered in such a way as to ensure that minorities never had enough of a majority in any district to get a candidate who represented them elected  If we were to come up with a completely fair system those minorities would almost certainly lose some representation  If the elected representatives represented everyone in their district equally regardless of minority status that wouldn t matter in an ideal world     but the elected representatives don t and we don t live in an ideal world either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ever  We imprison more people than any other nation ever has in all human history  
PoliticalDiscussion,I honestly think we need more states  I think we should carve out new states around every major coastal city with a radius of  miles  It isn t fair to up state New Yorkers that NYC dominates their politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dumb   not you just the laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,Easy dont send anyone to prison We have people who can commit  crimes and still walk the streets 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s cool you expanded and explained it way better 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is Operation an accurate anatomical lesson 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree there are many situations that could cause such a disagreement Not arguing that point I am arguing against this sort of temporary legal guardianship of a man over any woman he impregnates that you re suggesting I think you d run into some serious equal protection problems there unless you were willing to extend the same rights of procreation to women  for example a woman that wants a child could legally force her husband to impregnate her 
PoliticalDiscussion,Theft taking somebodies property unlawfully    edit that took  seconds 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Ron Paul
PoliticalDiscussion, and with over   people that s nearly k per Rep That s not very  representative and leads to a government that is very out of touch  I think we should have ten times as many Representatives I m serious Of course we d have to pay them only  as much as the Reps we have make now but that would be good for the system too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politics is a contact sport   Rove Bush and Fox take advantage of everything they can at every turn including calling other country leader names and branding  freedom fries because they were against the invasion of Iraq Americans were called traitors  by Fox for not supporting the criminal invasion   everything is personal in politics   All I hear is sour grapes    
PoliticalDiscussion,Wholly agreed on all points I took  large public outcry to mean something on the order of what we ve seen already in recent decades and as you point out that just won t change anything  Sorry I misunderstood and thanks for clarifying 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for sharing that video it really hits close to home for me I was  when I decided to go to the best school I was accepted to  Drexel University   year  I had full support for it from everyone I talked to except for my dad He told me to go to a community college near home for very little money but I didn t listen and ended up taking out   in loans for that year alone I transferred out of that school when my dad refused to cosign my second year s loan and I really am glad that I had no choice but to go to a cheaper school now but I m still stuck with the first year s loan for a very very long time 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t agree but even if it s true then we can conclude the state only has legitimacy in those areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you ll excuse me I m going to go and start a hospital  Let s hire some workers learning everything from the internet 
PoliticalDiscussion,Next you re going to be telling us that minorities also comprise the majority of police prosecutors judges and juries who prosecute the the other minorities  Could that possibly have anything to do with the way justice is dispensed and how such statistics are generated  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt they     No comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,You appear to be treating the  market as not only a sentient entity but as an entity only capable of doing right  It may very well be your god at this point  Hell I m pretty sure this is how cults get started 
PoliticalDiscussion,But there are some common reasources that can only be provided by the state  courts  the criminal justice system  Just because it s not a good idea to nationalize toothbrushes does not mean that the state has no legitimacy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you confused There are plenty of fiscal conservative comedians such as Carlin and Hicks It s just that these guys are social liberals I e don t care if gays get married 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are daring to insinuate that blacks are violent  s
PoliticalDiscussion,Bill Hicks and George Carlin are only social liberals beyond they they are strong proponents for individual rights I e fiscal conservatives So in actuality the best comedians are actually conneervative 
PoliticalDiscussion,If there is a chance that changes to a district would result in a non minority candidate winning the election in that district yes     and the way the laws are currently written they would win 
PoliticalDiscussion,It  is completely hers since it s completely within a part of and dependent on her body That the resultant fetus contains a male s genetic material is completely irrelevant  And yes she should get full say By your argument every parent has a right to dictate what happens to their sons and daughters since their the biological product of their parents Is that also what you believe 
PoliticalDiscussion,Umm all those comedians are only social liberals besides Bill Maher they are all fiscal conservatives 
PoliticalDiscussion,  gt    She can walk away clean from the situation   No She can not walk away clean Every been around a birth It is neither clean nor something most women just jump up and go run a marathon after completing  Being pregnant and birthing a child changes a woman s body for the rest of her life even when everything goes well There is no way to compensate a woman that would make it  all better now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Re apportionment  Prepare to have a HoR with quite a bit more members   I recall an attempt to pass an Amendment for this and today it would result in have like  representatives instead of the    we have now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think  the complete eclipse of traditional state sovereignty is what we re seeing  We re seeing increasing use of mercenaries   there is a limit to this and we re already seeing a gigantic backlash 
PoliticalDiscussion, Number of black on white murders of  strangers   stranger in     Number of White on black stranger murders    And since the number of blacks is about   the number of whites that means their murder rate is about x the white rate  Clearly white people need to get their act together 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think this is highly unlikely 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you mean if they split a district centered on Harlem to include more   say caucasians to balance it out then black politicians would sue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very interesting  I saw this youtube recently   
PoliticalDiscussion,Science 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s not a consequence of anything It s called biology  Whatever I m not going to argue semantics with you The point is that it s uncontrollable   gt So father owns the mothers womb too Where do you draw the line How much control should one adult have over the body of another adult I honestly have no idea what you re proposing  No he partly owns the fetus inside of her I draw the line when her womb is no longer occupied by an organism that is partly someone else s I am proposing simply that a fetus is not solely property of the mother that it is also the father s and if he wants to raise it then it is his right to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its in her body Period I just don t get what you don t get about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,My point is that he shouldn t make it personal and say that the kid would look like what his son would look like That s completely unnecessary I m not a republican but I don t agree with what he said Sorry if I think he shouldn t be using the situation to gain support 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There are plenty of funny conservatives but they re not really comedians We call them   clowns  congressmen  Fixed
PoliticalDiscussion,How is it her s alone It s not her fetus alone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes women should have complete control over their bodies But we re not talking about a woman s body we re talking about something  within her body that is not completely her s She shouldn t get full say over it because of that simple fact 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You hear day to day comments from Obama to the media about the Afghan shooting  I haven t seen anyone claiming that there s been a grave miscarriage of justice in the Robert Bales case  in fact it was just announced that he s going facing  counts of murder  With Bales a tragedy was committed but the suspect was immediately apprehended and is facing justice With Trayvon Martin a tragedy was committed and the suspect perpetrator is still free with the local authorities dragging their feet  There s a lot at play in the Martin case It s  possibly probably evidence that racism  is very much alive and well it s a possible tipping point for stand your ground laws which is sure to bring the a ers out in force it s a tragic case of a young victim etc Also the Martin case took a while to actually get going while most of the  relevant  details about the Bales case were known almost immediately  So they re certainly being covered differently but I disagree that there s some concerted effort to  wag the dog here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can t declare bankruptcy but you can default  In the mortgage crises it was the default rate which caused a lot of headaches 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say don t go to college  What s so hard about that Learn for free on google Or find a cheap school  You can get an MBA online from a nationally accredited school for  lt  k  But kids want fun not education  The subsidized schools are a major contributing factor to this  As an employer I couldn t care less about applicants with a degree  I often find smarter people with more work experience than those with a degree that isn t worth anything because everyone has one  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt how is that fair  The rights and responsibilities in this situation are uneven because the biological roles are uneven Women are the ones who bear all the risks of pregnancy so they are the ones who get to decide whether to undertake those risks You can t cancel out the  unfairness of those sex roles by fiat Nothing we do can make the risks and responsibilities the same for both partners   at least not until we have the technology to suction the fetus out of the mom and raise it in a test tube 
PoliticalDiscussion,My response is people reap what they sew  People make choices  It s a pretty simple life to build your own house in the woods and grow your own food  If you want more work for it  I would advise not to go to college nowadays  It s not worth it  You can learn more for free on the internet and the opportunity cost is too high to go to higher education 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the state provided every single good then the same argument could be made about every single good but you see that this is a ridiculous proposition Hence your original one is as well Just because the state provided the toothbrushes in Soviet Russia doesn t mean that it  should  Same applied to other services 
PoliticalDiscussion,cheap labor helps the majority of the world  Third world countries have now become better off by having most of the people begin to work and provide for their families rather than having nothing  If you don t like a low wage then don t take it  You aren t being forced to  If you want a simple life and don t want to become better off then build your own house on cheap land and grow your own food 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think we sould go that way I think we should go in the other direction and not force fathers to pay child support if they sign some sort of document beforehand stating they give up all responsibility in raising it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because his child is being taken from him without his consent  But your alternative is that the mother carry the baby to term without her consent  I ll grant you that the father is losing something but the cost to the father of his not having the child seems vastly outweighed by the cost to the mother of forcing her to have the child 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I explicitly say that I am only talking about cases of consensual sex  How on earth are the doctors supposed to know if the woman got pregnant during consensual sex If she can get an abortion without permission if she was raped then any woman who disagreed with her husband or boyfriend could just say she was raped It makes the entire idea completely infeasible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because this basically allows a man to force a woman to carry his baby regardless of what she wants  I d want to have final say over what happens to my body women should get the same   Just because the guy can t in most circumstances get to carry the baby doesn t mean he should be able to force someone else to The better choice is to go find someone who has similar life goals to you or stop being such a selfish bitch  Also the idea that getting a girl pregnant somehow equally affects the man is laughable I d much rather get someone else pregnant than get pregnant myself considering all the downright terrifying side effects not to mention the birthing process itself  You know whenever I hear some feminists at my college go on about how men are oppressing them and gender inequality and so on I think that they re really exaggerating what s going on and that they should be more content with the way things are Then I hear people like you speak and it makes me a little sad that I have to go back and admit that maybe they have a point 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have no understanding of economics so we ve hit a brick wall here until you learn more about it  By the way how has the government done in providing an adequate housing cars food businesses you want and need  Oh wait the market figured that out as it s supposed to   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yet the man is responsible for it for eighteen years Wut Maybe financially but stereotypically speaking the father has a lot less involvement in a child s life than the mother 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not a child yet It s a fetus Completely different things in terms of development and ability to support itself In most situations the thing being aborted is little more than a clump of cells leeching off the mother causing nausea and otherwise being a dick Considering that the mother has to do all of the legwork to get that clump of cells into something that can be considered human she should have the sole choice as to whether or not she goes through with it
PoliticalDiscussion, gt a mother should have the sole decision making power over the fetus because she is the one that must carry the child But how is that fair   It s her body  that s how it s fair If a man isn t going to like Her making the decision He never should have slept with her He knew the consequences when he decided to sleep with her 
PoliticalDiscussion,The question to me is if it is right for another person to have any input on how you treat your body or your health  And that s a definite no 
PoliticalDiscussion,me and my community do a lot of good for the poor I would hope it would translate  not guarantee I never said that to the big picture what with everyone having  more money to play with 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government isn t ruled by religion However politicians in government know how to use religion to appeal to their base and win votes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well in the Australian system electoral districts are handled completely separately to the party in power being drawn by the various apolitical state election commissions The sole aim of these drawing activities are to ensure roughly equal numbers of  voters Secondarily they seek to keep historical towns or communities together None of this crazy maps that you see in the US  So yes it is but only if  both sides agree to remove the party in power from drawing the boundaries 
PoliticalDiscussion,Apple doesn t give ipads to people who don t pay for them Preventing threats of violence costs money Preventing threats of violence to those who have no money to give is not a winning business strategy and there s no way to guarantee that other people will care that much  Consumers already don t give the slightest fuck about conditions of people out of sight and out of mind whether they are in sweatshops or whether they are actually being physically and violently coerced In what world do you imagine that they d care about people too poor to afford security or that this care would translate into a costly consumer choice that would select for companies that did so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Shortsighted idiots like you  are the government Doesn t that bother you 
PoliticalDiscussion,private security firms would prevent threats of violence

PoliticalDiscussion,Charity has never guaranteed solvency not at any point in history The only charity that comes close is what you would say is the very definition of un charity i e entitlement programs  In situations where charity is the only thing preventing Hobbesian scenarios dogma and ideology rule the lower class and  by no means prevents their exploitation under direct threats of violence The historical church is the best example of this 
PoliticalDiscussion,thats where charity comes in brother
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t disagree with much of what you said but I think our problems are  systemic rather than because of certain political personalities and figureheads As long as we believe that complex social problems can be solved using violence i e by state power I think we will have these problems and they can only get worse 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Supreme Court has repeatedly judged this to be false You have no guarantees of any kind  Due process freedom of speech right to bear arms  same Supreme Court recently reaffirming that you are guaranteed this  etc etc   You d be right to argue that you have less guarantees than are codified in the Constitution but the argument that you have no guarantees is not rooted in even the most recent of facts from the very institution you seek to indict 
PoliticalDiscussion,By codifying punishments for those who violate rights and letting the  customers be everyone regardless of their ability to pay  Your anarcho capitalist paradise is unique in that it s one of the only systems ever conceived of where you can literally be too poor to afford to be a human being in the eyes of society Those who cannot afford a private contracting firm are non entities they re fair game reduced to a state of survival of the fittest and ready to be predated upon in Hobbesian scenarios  The market has decided consumers have decided that trading final arbitration rights in return for strict guarantees of rights is within most contexts an acceptable price The evidence is in demonstrated preferece  the willingness of all such people who have the capability to choose other living arrangements  and there are a lot of other options to stay within their states and prosper  Not only is your  product insolvent it s also lacking in demand 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok I ll leave aside debates over what you mean by  human like  Why did people who were born before me have more of a right to property than I do now I don t have the option of being the first to manipulate anything There s nothing left for me  The reason I m complicating you idea of possession is because possession is the most fought over concept in the history of the world Who owns what and why and under what circumstances can you make something yours what can be legitimately owned how are things passed down  esp in the absence of a will  what historical events should be considered legitimate transfers what does it mean to steal something  A huge part of legal theory is the attempt to pick answer these questions To based you political philosophy on the assertion that they have self evident answers seems incredibly unrealistic to me Aside from the other implications of putting anarcho capitialism into practice I think it falls down if it cannot clearly answer to owns what  Btw I am not claiming that the state has a right to own all the property I hope that answers your two questions 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt they NEVER have a common agenda  In my mind an agenda is not  all or nothing  We have different agendas regarding different things some overlapping with those of some others Maybe  interests is a better choice of words   gt Even if they agreed on every single matter of policy which is impossible they would still have the internal politics of their super secret organization to contend with and those politics would favor spilling the beans for the exact same reason politicians leak stories to the press  A few points   A group can be defined by an agenda Until a person displays on his own sincere support for an agenda ideology or cause they aren t invited they aren t even made aware that the group exists Hell it could be two people This greatly reduces the chances for internal ideological differences   Small highly advanced organizations  like say a handful of the most powerful people in the world  can employ certain methods to ensure absolute loyalty and secrecy A few examples maximizing the detriment of leaking and maximizing the benefit of loyalty different forms of collateral such as incriminating evidence of complicity in a crime  e g killing a random person to join a gang  supposedly confessing your sexual history in S B  precise information trails making it possible to identify the leaker if information gets out etc   gt Define high level conspiracy  Orchestrated efforts toward a common agenda or common interests at the highest levels of power   gt I would call none of them a conspiracy in the grand sense of the term despite a great deal of conspiring  That s essentially my point Whether you consider it conspiracy in  the grand sense of the term or not  whatever that means  conspiring is commonplace The common interest doesn t have to be something nefarious like turning people into slaves or eliminating a certain race of people It could be something very simple very subtle 
PoliticalDiscussion, The most striking difference between the Finnish system and British is the fact that Finland has no private schools There are a handful of privately run religious schools and Steiner schools but places at these are state funded too   
PoliticalDiscussion,This is what this subreddit is all about people that like politics who are actually into politics and are man woman enough to tolerate contrary or opposing views without getting unnecessarily offended  Just wondering however   was there anything in particular that brought this post about Just curious 
PoliticalDiscussion,Looks like you are the one making a racist claim I never once said the the word black I said gang So are you saying being a gang member means you are black 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why don t you actually look in the rest of the comments I provided two polls Why do you doubt that Are you really that partisan that you can t believe democrats think Obama is a muslim 
PoliticalDiscussion,My solution is to just use a separate reddit account for  r politics  r politics and  r PoliticalDiscussion  r PoliticalDiscussion  There s really no way to control for people trying to downvote comments they don t agree with when it comes to politics   Being downvoted sucks but I don t see a clear way around it Even if you only try to downvote stupid or irrelevant comments it s not so difficult to become convinced that people with different viewpoints than yours are just bringing up stupid points all the time  
PoliticalDiscussion,Right but the masses of people have hardly heard of this dude even now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just let me see if I can sum up your claim  Black people are too stupid and scared to violate the law alone  I wouldn t bother publishing that if I were you  It is as insipid as it is racist and shows a complete lack of understanding about race and crime in this country in both the present and the past 
PoliticalDiscussion,That they lost    on bc nobody saw it and it was marketed poorly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not entirely true Jason Russel is getting plenty of ink 
PoliticalDiscussion,No you don t understand  If they are commentators that means you and I are political commentators too  Which means we are important just because we post on reddit  I like being important so to be logically consistent these other random people must also be important contributors to political discussion in this country 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think bombing Iran is GOP fault and will increase gas prices  We haven t bombed Iran so it isn t anyone s fault  It would increase gas prices though  Thankfully Obama is president and would never bomb a foreign country without the presence of dire need      gt What has Obama really done that matters How is higher gas his fault It is because of saber rattling over Iran and market speculation NOT OBAMA POLICY  As the person ultimately in charge of US foreign relations saber rattling would fall under Obama policy  Also there was the US led talk of sanctions against Iran also Obama policy not even a month ago 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well doctors will always need to go to medical school but people that go to school for say   photography or English They could pretty easily learn about their fields from the internet 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt More supply cheaper you can sell the product Got it flood the market with supply the price drops  Only if demand stays the same  If demand is increasing faster than supply is increasing prices rise  One need only look at the US China and India to see that demand is growing extraordinarily fast   gt If only we had more oil more refined gas  more refineries a higher supply of gas then oil companies would have more than current demand and start to flood the American market with cheap gas right  No they would start to flood the world market with gas which would probably be just enough to keep up with that increasing demand we were talking about   gt instead fungibility of gas  oil companies lowering prices once they have excess gas  more supply like they should they keep prices at home high and ship the surplus to china and Latin America What in this don t YOU understand  They aren t shipping cheap gas overseas  They are shipping it at equivalent costs  If you changed the item from gasoline to iPhones and China instituted a policy similar to the one you are advocating not allowing FoxConn to ship iPhones out of the country until there were so many iPhones in China that even the poorest beggar could afford one something you are not forseeing would happen  China might manage to highjack a single shipment of iPhones but Apple would not continue to order enormous quantities from them  They would have FoxConn build just enough iPhones to service the Chinese demand for them  Something similar would happen in the US with gasoline  We might temporarily see lower gas prices as the policy works its way through the supply chain however long it takes oil to get pumped out of the ground til it gets pumped into a car     But after that oil companies would adjust and only ship enough oil into the country to service American demand   and in reality we would probably end up with shortages and even higher gas prices   Your solution is short term and could only possibly work if the US were self sufficient oil wise  In reality the US imports extraordinary amounts of oil from all over the world and any restrictive policy instituted here would probably result in similar retaliatory policies across the globe   gt   In  U S refiners exported  million gallons per day of gasoline  diesel jet fuel and other petroleum products up from  million gallons per day a decade earlier    As the article says this is as a result of more fuel efficient cars and a drop of in demand caused by the recession  Paired with the fact that many refineries located to the US years ago because it was such a sure bet to continue using the most gasoline in the world we see that the US has a competitive advantage in a single part of the process of getting oil from the ground to our cars namely refining  You might as well be asking why doesn t China just keep all those consumer goods the rest of the world orders from it   gt   There s at least one domestic downside to America s growing role as a fuel exporter Experts say the trend helps explain why U S motorists are paying more for gasoline The more fuel that s sent overseas the less of a supply cushion there is at home    Which implies that we already enjoy a nice cushion because of having the refineries here in the first place and generous subsidies to the evil oil companies  In conclusion your outlandish policy proscriptions are based on an understanding of economics from before there was a way to reliably transport goods across the ocean and would no doubt hurt this nation s oil supply in both the long and short term far more than they would help them   Worst of all you came to this conclusion because of a single sentence written by an unnamed journalist who are of course know for their in depth knowledge of the intricacies of international oil markets s   In reality it was probably written because an important part of journalism is letting your readers know why the story matters and the writer decided to frame an obvious trend increase in demand is outstripping increase in supply in as alarmist a way a possible to get eyes on the page

PoliticalDiscussion, relevant comments were as subjective as irrelevant comments  Thats a circle jerk if I ve ever heard one Everyone is entitled to an opinion whatever  but everyone is also entitled to down voting   When someone espouses a view which is unsubstantiated within a factual context it s no only irrelevant  but it detracts from the discussion at hand   propagates misinformation amoung readers Down votes are a painless way to discourage destructive   unwarranted opinions   obtuse argumentative internet stubbornness   If any mods out there feel like down voting me because this negative comment violates the principle that all beliefs are subjective and inherently equal they are welcome to their due circle jerk maintenance   Edit if you want free discourse don t take up down votes personally Use a dummy account Bam Problem solved 
PoliticalDiscussion,A fact often forgotten in rhetoric of class warfare and  fairness  
PoliticalDiscussion,You are wrong because gas is not oil and both are international markets  If we start refusing to allow gasoline refined in the US overseas then there would be a drop in the amount of unrefined oil imported into the US  Since the US is dependent on foreign sources for oil we would only be shooting ourselves in the foot if we used export restrictions to institute some arbitrary price ceiling on gasoline prices  That and this inane fearmongering about China has got to stop  It makes just about all its proponents sound like racist country bumpkins who don t know how the economy works except that it helps people with different skin colors and thus is bad  So that s me manning up and explaining why I downvote you on a regular basis 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt people who have power and influence and a common agenda  This is the crux of it  they NEVER have a common agenda  Even if they agreed on every single matter of policy which is impossible they would still have the internal politics of their super secret organization to contend with and those politics would favor spilling the beans for the exact same reason politicians leak stories to the press   gt categorical denial of the existence of high level conspiracy  Define high level conspiracy  The Obama administration is conspiring to win the next election as is the Romney campaign  Each is the member of a political party that is conspiring to win congress  In congress members are constantly conspiring to achieve personal and legislative victories over other members   Some of these efforts are made in the light of day and are public knowledge some of them happen in smoked filled rooms  But I would call none of them a conspiracy in the grand sense of the term despite a great deal of conspiring 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but the point is that  fair is subjective and I find the argument that the rich should pay more when the economy is hurting because they are most able to handle the burden compelling especially considering that there s a general trend in that the richer you get the greater your debt to society for being able to acquire that wealth tends to become  The top tax rates have previously sat at numbers like  r   and no one is even suggesting returning anywhere close to that Some conservatives seem to be sensationalizing a   jump in the tax rate from  to   like it s suddenly going to force the rich to do all their shopping in bodegas or something The millionaires in the s seemed to manage just fine being taxed at   is it really so absurd to ask for  or  now  No one is arguing that the wealthy should be taxed to the point that they only have as much money as the middle class but is only being allowed to keep  million dollars out of  million in income something that really deserves to be compared to forcing them into poverty or something I mean even taking away only  million dollars a year you re so unbelievably far removed from any of the actual day to day concerns of the middle class it s a joke 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would like to say for the record though that I am not in favor of disabling the downvote button The ethos of discussion I believe is persuasion not coercion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is a big difference between things I don t know and things I can t know I m sure if I wanted to I could find out about Skull and Bones or the Bildeburg group I just don t care  No there is not much you can find out about those groups You may not care the point is there are high level secrets and secretive organizations that we don t can t know about That is a fact whether you care to verify it for yourself or not   gt The problem with grand conspiracies is that the bigger and more powerful the conspiracy the bigger the incentives to squeal  I don t think you can positively make that statement World power is a very unique circumstance You can t really compare it with anything else What is the incentive of squealing for revenge What do you have to gain compared to what is risked If you say nothing you remain powerful and just deal with whatever disagreement you had If you say something you risk everything even your life These people are a minority they are often hated by ordinary people they need each other  As I see it this kind of high level conspiracy is defined by two things people who have power and influence and a common agenda It s an obvious fact that people in high positions of power exist the question is whether or not they ever work together toward a common agenda I don t think that s a very big hurdle There is  documented evidence   of cases where this has happened The question really is to what extent they work together toward a common agenda and to what extent they get away with it I just don t see how you can assume that everything inevitably gets out And even if it gets out eventually there is a period of time when it remained secret Who knows something could come out tomorrow We just don t know is really all that I m arguing   rephrased the last paragraph a little
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of people in China watch American movies but they don t actually pay for them 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are basically no rules here unlike over at  r Politics  r Politics  but I am inclined to agree with la lutte s suggestions I won t be proposing a codification of this rule any time soon but it seems the users here especially those who have been here since the beginning are pretty self enforcing   Just a reminder though as subreddits grow one must be more vocal in reminding newcomers 
PoliticalDiscussion,They vie for customers and the ones which are not transparent effective or just are pruned out by the market process  I do not advocate that government be shut down tomorrow  it might require a cultural change toward a better general understanding of property rights but it certainly could happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the idea should be what taxes can they afford it should be what is fair Theoretically you could tax everyone s income up or down to a livable wage and the rich could  afford it because they could by definition live off it This isn t about affecting or not affecting their lifestyles This is about making our economy run smoothly so we can all enjoy a high standard of living Capitalism basically says those who are good with money will get more money to use wisely  and in return for their service they have more to blow on themselves  Whenever a rich person makes a wise investment that gains them a lot of money it s because their wise investment enabled someone else s dream to come true by giving them capital they needed to do something profitable Those who make wise investments become rich not off the backs of the working class but by wisely discriminating between good and bad ideas and helping those good ideas off the ground and letting bad ideas die 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because Hollywood brings a lot of money into the United States Movies are an export

PoliticalDiscussion,What power in history stopped taking freedom at any place on the sliding scale once they started taking it away 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is a big difference between things I don t know and things I can t know  I m sure if I wanted to I could find out about Skull and Bones or the Bildeburg group  I just don t care  The problem with grand conspiracies is that the bigger and more powerful the conspiracy the bigger the incentives to squeal  You think a dark cabal could rule the world for decades and never have any disagreements about policy  Without some people rising up in the organization by forcing others out Little secrets can be kept  If I started a secret society with me and  buddies it s fairly likely no one would ever learn our secret and arcane rituals  But once we start running the world or even just the neighborhood the betrayals will start and the knives will come out
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t mean all religious people want that but there are enough to make a difference A few examples that I can think of off the top of my head are  Santorum thinks its ok to outlaw contraception because of his religious convictions   then there is the religious crowd who doesn t want gay marriage to be legal and  lawmakers in TN that want creationism taught in science classrooms     I consider a law based on a religious belief one that has no basis otherwise All of the examples that I provided meet that standard because without religious beliefs I don t think anyone would be supporting them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wrote the original question and I promise the hypothetical was not between  freedom vs survival anything It s a political discussion forum If you are at the point of discussing politics it is assumed that your basic survival is not in imminent jeopardy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because one is extremely progressive taxation and the other is not 
PoliticalDiscussion,That may be true with people in general but it s by no means true in the absolute If it were true there would be no secrets Do you actually believe that all information in the public s interest is on the public record Again think about what you re implying Are there no corporate secrets Are there no government secrets Are there no secrets in private organizations Can you tell me what was discussed at last year s Bilderberg Conference Can you tell me anything for certain about Skull and Bones Secret societies do exist I m not saying that is evidence that they control the world I am just refuting your statement that people can t keep secrets It is easily refutable  Furthermore if people in very high positions of power decided to conspire they would have one very convenient thing in their favor most people are dismissive of even the possibility of that kind of conspiracy as this thread is evidence to  The idea that  new world order type secret societies are a fantasy is not based on any kind of rational argument It s based on a reaction to gullible conspiracy theorists who are generally regarded as intellectually inferior Another example of reactive thinking taking the extreme opposite position even when that position is equally irrational 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you earnestly post your thoughts  unless it s a duplicate of someone else s post then you are promoting discussion Things that don t support discussion are things that are off topic or trolling

PoliticalDiscussion,It s not about how gas prices work out for your budget If they do not fit in your budget  they certainly don t in mine I would recommend doing what you can to lower your dependence on gasoline In my case that meant giving up my car  not a choice so it was easy and moving close enough to work that I had a short bus ride there I now live further away and have a one hour commute that involves two miles of walking  or taking busses and not walking but I prefer rail to bus as rail is always on time  I ve actually started to enjoy life much more and after six months of walking several miles every day I am feeling great I ve also discovered a walk to work with good music is a very relaxing way to get ready for the day and go in ready to work without the use of stimulants Fortunately I live in a beautiful neighborhood so the first mile of my walk looks something like  this    taken at dawn today   I understand that it is not at all easy making these types of lifestyle changes it has been two years now since I lost my car and it hasn t been easy but I think it has made me a stronger person and have given me much more appreciation for the world around me and the conveniences of modern day life 
PoliticalDiscussion,And that s why the concept is compelling If the government is not needed for the administration of defense the open market can start to lead solutions in this arena It is my hope that they don t start creating a lawopoly in this area 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re wrong because oil production isn t the same as refining  We  import oil refine it and  export gasoline  The exports help pay for the imports  If we stopped exporting we d be paying the real cost of the imports at the pump  There s a great thread on this subject right now over on r economics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well what he believes is really not that far from what people like Alex Jones preach Have you heard Alex Jones interview him And for the record I don t like Alex Jones 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exporting is not why the prices are high That is likely due to numerous factors One is the fact that oil is non renewable and we are having to get it from harder to access fields which means it can cost more to extract and transport There s a lot of debate about when we will see production peak but a lot of people believe we are peaking have peaked will peak soon Another factor is likely speculators  here   is an interesting article about that Yet another factor is the increasing demand for oil from the developing world All of that and more combine to make for high gas prices   Here   is a chart showing US oil imports and exports You ll notice we import nearly nine million barrels of crude oil a day and export only  thousand barrels of crude  as I understand it s because it is cheaper to send them to Canadian refineries than to US ones due to the location of the fields  However we export three million barrels a day of finished products As I understand that is due to our huge refining capacity We create more refined oil products than we have demand for in this country so we export them You ll also notice that we actually only export  thousand barrels of finished motor gasoline a day whereas we  consume   something on the order of  million barrels a day  The fact is that we live in a world that experiences exponential growth and that growth requires more and more energy Unfortunately non renewable fossil fuels are our main source of energy and the supplies are slowly dwindling As it becomes more and more expensive to extract those fuels the price will only increase The best policy choice in my opinion is to commit to transitioning to renewable energy sources as soon as possible Fossil fuels will never come back and humanity has no choice but to turn our backs on them Unfortunately oil companies are the most profitable on earth  exxon has annual profits in the  billion range and are able to use those profits to have great influence on our legislation 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The current situation  in theory is a guarantee of state protected rights regardless of one s ability to pay   Not even in theory   The Supreme Court has  repeatedly judged this to be false  You have no guarantees of any kind government employees have no obligation whatsoever to perform any duty towards a citizen  The idea that the state guarantees security or rights to citizens is the most masterful piece of propaganda ever perpetrated on the planet  Think about it  How can so many people persist in believing a lie that has been refuted even by the  ultimate judges of society  People are often seriously shocked when they discover it s a lie either by research or in an unfortunate incident 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would totally choose the tyranny of the free market  If I get a choice at least my money won t be used to put peaceful people like pot smokers in cages    M each and that s just the cost of the injustice system  
PoliticalDiscussion,You re lying again Or are you in denial Would you just rather I deleted my comments as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Politics is morality writ large so if your morality is guided by your religious beliefs your politics will be too  It isn t necessarily a bad thing   Martin Luther King was guided by faith after all  The real problem is on the other side of the equation  Evangelical Christians in America have let their faith be hijacked by right wing politicians and it s led them to take some decidedly unchristian positions

PoliticalDiscussion,Cowardly hit n run downvotes will eventually cause the decline of reddit not just r politicalcirclejerkdiscussion Those that employ hit n run downvotes know this full well It s time the management of reddit stood up to the challenge of making reddit again a meaningful place of dialogue and not just a repository for those on the downvote dole to make an easy living at two bits per interaction 
PoliticalDiscussion,Saying that religious people want their values established as law is a little misguided Christians believe murder and theft are wrong so does that make laws they create in this area a religious decision Certain moral values are shared across multiple creeds so what determines a law made in the name of religion in the US Can you provide any examples 
PoliticalDiscussion,let the market decide the value of gas it takes human labor to produce everything that is produced A claim to anything produced that is not of your labor is a claim on the labor of others slavery As long there is no government enforced privilege in the production of gas justice dictates to let the market decide

PoliticalDiscussion,I don t disagree with your projection of what could happen in this scenario but it seems like a stretch to say that  there s   bound  to be a critical mass etc  The first thing to consider is that many PMC employees are not soldiers  In order to be hired as the kind of contractor you re thinking of at a top tier PMC like Academi  formerly Blackwater  you typically have to be a former  elite soldier like a Ranger Recon Marine etc    There aren t even enough ex soldiers of this caliber who are still fighting age to exceed the current size of the American military  In addition many of the PMC employees employed around the world are simply not soldiers  They are drivers mechanics cooks etc  Regardless I disagree with your basic premise which is that the number of private mercenaries will increase relative to the number of existing American soldiers  Granted we are in the process of replacing our regular military presence with contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan but the number of contractors in those places will remain static and I don t see the U S invading a country with only mercenaries anytime soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the role of government is to help and protect it s citizens The tax cuts on the rich being ended isn t going to hurt their quality of life too much They ll still be driving bentleys and summering in the hamptons and that s an extra  billlion saved If you end the tax cuts for the middle classes or the poor then the money they have to spend on taxes will hurt them pretty deeply  Honestly it s kind of a silly question Why not just end all government spending under your logic I mean it d save everyone trillions of dollars after all The answer is because people need some stuff The rich don t need a tax cut that adds to the deficit The middle classes do It s a simple cost benefit analysis That  trillion saved over a decade is obviously thought to be less than the overall cost that having no cuts would cause 
PoliticalDiscussion,Until all government leaders realize they are supposed to be upholding the Constitution as the law of the land and not the Bible Qur an etc then it is going to keep happening This will continue to happen too because there are so many religious people who want religious values established as law I don t see this sort of thing going away any time soon

PoliticalDiscussion,yet you are making arguments that it s legitimate to violently extract payment from people that you forced your services on    
PoliticalDiscussion,so what is the answer how do you lower prices if producing more gas will only send more gas overseas  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Most of what I write isn t really meant to be popular but to record my own thoughts If people happen to like it or a discussion surrounds it so much the better  Not to nitpick but it seems like a journal would be a better format  This is a discussion subreddit so if you re going to simply record your own thoughts without trying to prompt a discussion then there s no real reason to write it out here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Think of your current job Another company comes along and offers to pay you twice what for the same thing that you do for your current employer Are going to stay with your current job or take the offer Now think of your current employer appealing to the government to bar you from accepting the offer Would  you be cool with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Certainly Libertarians would argue that if you cut tax you encourage spending Vis a vis if you knew tomorrow that next months wage packet would include an extra  x or whatever you would be more likely to buy that car book that holiday etc It would stimulate the economy  In the utopian dreamland that Libertarians envisage yes this makes a lot of sense In the real world in which we actually live no 
PoliticalDiscussion, Reddiquette   is an ideal people internalize ideals differently   Most of what I write isn t really meant to be popular but to record my own thoughts If people happen to like it or a discussion surrounds it so much the better   However I do find downvotes discouraging and rarely use them myself 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why don t we make a Hollywood Tax  Tax every major movie star production studio sports stars etc for every dime they got  
PoliticalDiscussion,There s bound to be a critical mass where private mercenaries outnumber armed forces controlled by the whole of civilians Once that is hit if the mercenaries decided to go to war they could take over the country    They also have the advantage of working from within the system and the physical boundaries of the country  No clean trench lines here and a full working knowledge of how the civilian controlled army works    It d be worse than a traditional civil war 
PoliticalDiscussion,What do you mean create Using what resources Do you have to own all of them too What if the resources you used occur naturally how could you own them What if you used someone else s technique to make it  What do you mean discover Be the first person to find it or the first person to see that it could be used for something If I discover the atom do I own all the atoms If I find an island but can t get there do I own it What if other people see it after me without my help and get there do they own it  What do you mean no one else wants it No one living now Do future generations have less a right to property than we do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok poor phrasing How could these function in a just manner 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you create it if you discover it if no one else wants it it should be yours 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because then their taxes would go up as well  And they wouldn t like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Private cooperative courts and police
PoliticalDiscussion,No really what makes it yours We ll get into how things should or shouldn t be used later your argument rests on a claim to property What makes something your property

PoliticalDiscussion,ok so gas prices are cool for ya not sure I understand how more gas will solve the problem and lower prices if it hasn t already since we have so much we are sinding to China please help I guess I am dense  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok mate after reading this reply I ve got to say I m out If you want to chalk this up as a win then do it but i m not going to engage you any more   The blog you linked me to is hilarious It s what I would write if I were parodying anarcho capitalism Seriously I was expecting some Nozick or Hayek coming at me and you gave me this  I can t even begin to talk about what is wrong with it If you re linking to it then it s take way more time than I m willing to invest  Further more the points you ve made are utterly predictable nosense I m gonna take this in isolation because I ve got other stuff on and this is a waste of time It s not the worst but it s one that I think sums up the flaw in your thinking   gt What s cheaper constant death resulting in loss of labor and a smaller recruitment pool       who wants to work for a company where you can be killed at any moment   cost of weapons and so on or paying a small arbitration fee at an      independent arbitration office to settle the matter       Cops soldiers fighter pilots marines sailors ice road truckers firemen deep sea fishermen muggers marines drug dealers mafiosi terrorists paramilitaries war correspondents spies many political activists racecar drivers astronauts private security contractors boxers mma fighters         What do you mean independent Independent of whom for what to do what How independent are you if you rely on repeat business to make a profit Would companies not chose arbitrator that are seen as sympathetic to them What if the losing party refuses to accept the arbitration 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The value of U S fuel exports has grown steadily over the past decade coinciding with rising oil prices and increased demand around the globe     gt And there s a simple reason why America s refiners have been eager to export to these markets gasoline demand in the U S has been falling every year since  It dropped by another  percent in  With the economy struggling motorists cut back Also cars and trucks have become more fuel efficient and the government mandates the use of more corn based ethanol fuel     It s a business not a charity 
PoliticalDiscussion,if you are in a fight you cannot win fairly and you are not the aggressor using a gun is perfectly legitamete 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s a puppet of the financial elite in general 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is not political discussion
PoliticalDiscussion,Anecdotal evidence will not help you argue your point there are many businesses that grow and profit as the quality of their goods and services decreases I would argue that most of the largest companies in the US have experienced this phenomenon Why should security be any different  Corporations of any stripe are worried about the bottom line first and customer satisfaction second  Just look at the largest and most profitable security firm in the country  Xe formerly Blackwater  These guys are so foul they had to change their name to deal with public backlash Are these the guys you want policing your neighborhood  The police may have a bad habit of protecting the guilty among them but I assure you corporate culture is much much worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,so today America is using less gas and oil the surplus is sent to China and LA drill more will create more surplus  we already have today so what changes other than more gas to china more money in oil companies pockets    prices at home haven t fallen today  with today s surplus tomorrow s increased surplus will change nothing just more for china 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Edit if you want free discourse don t take up down votes personally Use a dummy account Bam Problem solved  Not really  If you post a very unpopular viewpoint and it gets buried there is much less chance for intelligent discourse seeing as fewer people will look that far down the page  That s the whole point of what the mod is saying don t downvote things just discuss them counter them as you see fit  If someone post something that you know is nonfactual instead of downvoting it wouldn t it be better to link a source showing how wrong it is  Then you can actually correct a misconception that is probably shared by others 
PoliticalDiscussion,   It is obvious no matter how much oil we have or gas we will ship any over supply to china wiht no change in prices at home   so you said stop blaming the president and let the oil companies and markets have their way 
PoliticalDiscussion,The social issues are going through the media right now because they are getting a lot of attention mainly down to the success of Santorum but social issues will never win a presidential election because everybody is willing to disregard them in favour of different main factors each election  In  this factor will definitely be the Economy    When the economy or foreign affairs goes wrong most voters tend to forget about the Social Issues unfortunately there is a minority who pushes social issues up and though these are a very small minority they are also one of the loudest ones 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you for proving that your argument has nothing to offer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whilst these cases are obviously a bad thing they are also extremes gerrymandering in the past tended towards changing the voting districts to encourage minority voters and is still used successfully today which is why African Americans are extremely well represented in the House   of the house seats   of the population but like every minority are under represented in the Senate  Whilst Gerrymandering is illegal under race it still is legal under terms of voting record if a district has over   or maybe  I can t remember of a single party then it can be legally gerrymandered to fit in  Gerrymandering whilst bad in principle actually can work well in reality for instance in Pennsylvania the Democrat seat would probably have gone to a Republican if the majority of the state is Republican but due to the Gerrymandered seat the Democrats of the State get a voice too  The only way to stop Gerrymandering is to have proportional representation for the whole state for instance instead of having  congressmen from  different districts in a state you would have a statewide election with the seats being split up accordingly Without the election being statewide you will consistently have gerrymandering and corruption 
PoliticalDiscussion,Allow me to illuminate some context  He says he records his own thoughts but this is in reference to what he is posting in a discussion based website on a more specifically discussion based portion of that website  I m fairly certain on a post about Ron Paul he would record his own thoughts about Ron Paul thus would another item thought viewpoint be available for discussion Virtually anything could be discussed why would he need to explicitly state in his comment that he prompts discussion for him to have actually prompted discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,The constitution is not always considered a living document actually today there are more strict constructionists on the bench today i e those you believe the Constitution should be taken word for word than there has been since at least   Strict Constructionists today Scalia Thomas Roberts and Alito are all strict constructionists and also conservatives with Kennedy tending towards it  Source NY Times  
PoliticalDiscussion,Not every Anarcho Capitalist  worship or even like Ayn Rand 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That sounds nice but it s not really true I can t remember where I saw the polling numbers to link them here but generally people are in favor of paying higher taxes themselves when they are linked to specific programs they are interested in  When these people talk about paying more in taxes for programs they specifically favor do they mean just them or do they wan t higher earners to pick up a disproportional amount of the pie    I specifically referring to the motivation of those who wish that higher earners would pay disproportionately more in taxes for a fixed set of government programs while refusing to pay more in taxes themselves  despite the necessity of doing so    gt I think the OP has conflated several issues here The value of a progressive tax system how the progressiveness of our tax system compares to how it has been historically the marginal value of a dollar to a middle class family vs the marginal value of a dollar to a multimillionaire  The marginal value of a dollar to a millionaire is obviously less than it would be to a middle class family but the point is that the deficit cannot be reasonably reduced with only millionaire billonaire dollars because there aren t enough millionaires billionaires  It is necessary to tax those who do not make k at higher rates  So I am not necessarily making a point about fairness I am more making a point about arithmetic  Also  for capital gains is too low  That is another problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your friend is probably buying a little too much tin foil  On the other hand one has to wonder why Jon Corzine continues to run free

PoliticalDiscussion,   that s not even the issue at hand No one has even suggested that You re just making shit up that isn t relevant to this discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I was talking specifically about exports  Your statement is still totally true 
PoliticalDiscussion,The constitution is considered a living document and is amended when need be The bible is what it is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most extremes aren t true 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you are saying that we should not listen to values written down hundreds of years ago   like the Bible written roughly  years ago    does the Constitution not also hold this value it being written in   
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok so Devs Advocate do you believe that there should be no choice or set of choices that a human being can make in their life to make them live in opulence Do you think there should be not set of choices a person can make to cause them to live in poverty If we allow for human choices to have consequences then we can t blast people for making good choices and benefiting from them Your statement doesn t differentiate between different kinds of rich people so your argument is basically that wealth is always bad unless poverty is totally eliminated   Furthermore if you  Tax them for every dime they got  movies will no longer be profitable People will no longer make movies professionally and an art form will be lost All of the jobs they sustain  Actors directors cameramen set designers catering special effects companies movie theaters movie rentals pay per view cable will be lost along with all the money they bring into the country Furthermore most of those taxes would probably affect many television shows as well so basically you d unemploy an entire industry and take away all the movies and tv so they d have nothing to watch while being unemployed 
PoliticalDiscussion,With regards to rights or with regards to policy solvency 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are looking at America and how it was  years ago and comparing to the rest of the world until  China was still under Chairman Mao who was responsible for roughly  million deaths Hitler was less facist than Mao and so as a comparison Chinese living standards have gone up significantly   Similarly Africa and the Middle East have had atrocities for large lengths of the th Century it is however the rise in technology that has made you think the world is getting worse  You are right about globalization the world is getting smaller metaphorically speaking campaigns like Kony   whether you agree or not would never have come about in  s the internet is responsible for worldwide news on a scale unheard of so yes there seems to be more atrocities but in reality there s just more coverage of them  In the  s news was in a single format newspapers in the  s radio also existed by the  s you also had the beginnings of national television news  However none of them had the same sort of impact as the internet did suddenly you went from corporations controlling  the news nationally to news being much freer and easier to get this came with news from other country s you often wouldn t have heard about For instance I live in the UK and  years ago I would not have heard a single thing about the Republican primaries I probably would have known about the Presidential election result but that would probably be it if you re looking at country s like Russia Saudi Arabia or Indonesia there s no way I d be able to know much about their local news not easily anyway  Generations are changing the world yes and to an extent this generation is much more liberal than the ones before us but the same could be said about the civil rights era the controversy being over race not religion or sexual orientation  The world isn t getting any worse and in many places it s getting much better the internet helps to expose these international problems in a way not possible before but no you shouldn t judge yesterday s generation on the same guidelines as you are judging ours because the situation especially with technology has changed dramatically 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Systems will be in place to help the poor Americans spend almost  billion a year on private charity donations  And as people like Lew Rockwell will happily point out these charity donations are not sustainable improvements to infrastructure But maybe you don t support him  Can I ask what systems will be in place to provide private defense services to people who cannot afford private defense services If we are not obligated to do it why do you think it would be done If you say  I can t give you the specifics the market will decide  that s all well and good but the market already does a poor job of reliably mobilizing the poor up the ladder or protecting them from victimization so you ll accept my apology if I simply don t accept that explanation at face  gt The market didn t decide this consumers didn t this this the government did  As far as I know expatriation is still legal for all citizens of the US so your choices are not being constrained by strict force  gt the  if you don t like it leave fallacy  false dichotomy  Demonstrated preference is worlds different from  like it or leave it  I m concerned you don t understand my argument If you have any questions I would happily answer them  gt Law without Government  I completely understand how law comes about without government the existence of such is not negated or advanced at all by my argument Why do you think this is relevant to this discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A lot of people   in China  everywhere watch American movies but they don t actually pay for them  FTFY
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes and in the world we currently live in tax cuts are perhaps targeted wrongly due to existing invested interests  surprised my post got downvotes but I guess one should be wary of angering the Libertarian cirklejerk on r 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt it s not the polices job to protect or serve the public it s to enforce laws  Yes I realize that but that has nothing to do with whether rights are guaranteed as in fact that s ostensibly what  enforce laws does It s like an insurance provider telling you  My job is not to simply get you money it s to run an insurance company according to contract   gt Congress has repeatedly ruled that the constitution is only valid when convenient  Could I see the  Constitution is only valid when convenient decision 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The reason that raising taxes on the rich is so popular is that most people would rather that more money be raised in taxes but not actually pay more in taxes themselves  That sounds nice but it s not really true I can t remember where I saw the polling numbers to link them here but generally people are in favor of paying higher taxes  themselves when they are linked to specific programs they are interested in  I think the OP has conflated several issues here The value of a progressive tax system how the progressiveness of our tax system compares to how it has been historically the marginal value of a dollar to a middle class family vs the marginal value of a dollar to a multimillionaire

PoliticalDiscussion, gt  taxes are violence   And precisely what happens if you do not pay 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you re going to ask a question straight from a textbook at least try to put it in context please
PoliticalDiscussion,This is exactly right the top end of the tax spectrum is not the only problem the middle class is not paying enough either  
PoliticalDiscussion,You imagine  Yep 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even better I just saw on the wikipedia page that a pilot was injured or something so I just wanted to make sure I wasn t potentially spouting any incorrect facts 
PoliticalDiscussion,I won t argue with that   I can t know what was in the man s heart  My point is simply that there are Christians on both sides of the political fence      Unscrupulous politicians and preachers are trying hard to equate Christianity with Conservatism and it s increasingly the foundation of popular support for Republican candidates  Those on the left who adopt a knee jerk anti Christian position are just playing into their hands  Let s not do Ralph Reed s job for him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you the bodag of said brigade 
PoliticalDiscussion,In  the year before the tax cut they were  of GDP   Further if you focus solely on individual taxes as a percentage of GDP it went from    in  then from  to  by 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sounds like somebody s in PS  Politics of the European Union 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are only so many times you can reply to something like  taxes are violence before you realize your just tossing trollfood   There are only so many times you can take a comment seriously which is ignorant of basic common stuff the poster would have learned several times in school if they had been paying attention   I don t think people should downvote purely out of spite but I also don t think people should think a sub reddit is immune to the lethargies   bad habits which characterize the internet as a whole 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alright thanks for the links I might read some of them but others I ve already read or are poorer more simplistic versions of things that I ve read   I am not asking you to educate me In fact your conduct throughout this discussion suggest that you are not familiar with philosophical or normative debate or indeed any humanities based discussion or literature to any great degree  I did however ask you to provide me with convincing arguement which support you cause and answers to very basic weaknesses  such as the vagueness of the concept of ownership  You have singularly failed to do this Sending me to an FAQs section or a frankly rather shit blog does not suffice The answers which are found in these sources are unsatisfactory I ve seen them before and they just don t stand up  If you want to tell me that the state is illegitimate then you re going to have to give me reasons that out weigh those in Hobbe s Leviathan Locke s The Second Treatise on Government Plato s Republic Aristotle s Politics Mill s Considerations on Representative Government and On Liberty Marx s Communist Manifesto and Das Capital Rawls Theory of Justice Rousseau s Social Contract Kant s categorical imperative Machiavelli s Discourses as well as the work of Max Waber to name a few    I m sure you have considered and refuted all of these arguments and that you are not only spending your time reading Friedman Hayek Nozick and other associated authors I m just disappointed that you re not willing to engage with criticisms in a substantive manner   
PoliticalDiscussion,That s cool 
PoliticalDiscussion,Give people very lenient sentences and let them out early
PoliticalDiscussion,Local govts are not equipped to deal with poverty Unless you mean that federal funds are given to local govts and that s how it s administered That can work  But relying on local govts to somehow acquire and then distribute the funds would never ever work Maybe in rich areas like Beverly Hills or Manhattan But what about deep Appalachia like WV   Kentucky Ummm no 
PoliticalDiscussion,I usually get massive downvotes for posting radical information or ideas Counter arguments I usually get tend to be hatred most of the time There is  rule I do follow never reply if you agree with someone as that gives me or the other person nothing to go from  Moreover I think it is fair to say that I don t even take part of downvoting or upvoting as I find them meaningless activities that would give me nothing I do like that other people downvote though as I can find some interesting comments by just searching so called  bad comments without ever having to read the whole comment section 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zero casualties actually 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have conflicting criticisms in your straw man argument  This statement  gt The purchase price will notbe based on one s ability to pay but like all private corporate product services on a flat price where those who can afford it may purchase it while those who cannot afford it are SOL   Seems to contradict this statement  gt I m saying that support of private corporate supremacy is support of a system functionally equivalent to Russian communism  You seem to be making the  rich will rule objection    and it will be like communism at the same time  Regarding the concern that one firm will take over there are  dis economies of scale that limit firm size    in a free market 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t make sense of the question Try browsing wikipedia 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So you hear a pro oil anti regulation conservative malign environmentalism as a religion and you swallow that wholesale  Naturally like the typical redditor you attack the man and not the argument he made If the argument is wrong then explain why it s wrong    gt Im not an environmentalist Im an average consumer who eats meat litters and doesnt recycle   Eating meat has nothing to do with environmentalism and people who litter are fucking assholes   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The first thing to consider is that many PMC employees are not soldiers  The same thing can be said about the US military  Also there are many companies that have mercs other than Blackwater that I m sure have lower standards    I get your point and I hope you re right that it isn t an eventuality  However this industry is growing larger and getting more responsibilities every year  They ve even been used for combat in Iraq which is something nobody thought would happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just to let everyone know this thread was linked by a vote brigade subreddit called   anarcho  capitalism     When this happens a flock of Ayn Rand worshipping neckbeards descends on some particular thread shits all over the insightful posts and forms a man pile on the most idiotic ones that conform to their adolescent belief system  They are in no way actual anarchists who are anti capitalist and anti state   whether or not that state belongs to a private fiefdom   Carry on 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think he meant you have to conform to the populist ideas that you disagree with but  r politicaldiscussion  r politicaldiscussion is not your  r politicaldiary  r politicaldiary  
PoliticalDiscussion,la lutte is not saying you can t downvote he is saying that if you do you should at least leave a comment as to why you did downvote  Now if there are a bunch of comments stating  this or  so brave or any thing that truly does not add to the discussion I don t think a response is necessary  But if someone truly did take the time to type out a thoughtful response and it does add to the discussion  albeit maybe only from their point of view you should at least give them the dignity of a response  This is a subreddit that is supposed to be about having an open dialogue  If we just downvote those we disagree with then where are we going to end up  It will be  r politics  r politics all over again  
PoliticalDiscussion,My main issue with discussions like this one is that I suspect you are simply lazy It is not my responsibility to educate you and furthermore it will probably be entirely fruitless You education is your responsibility There are plenty of resources and I would be glad to list you some if you are interested If you are unwillingly to even gather a basic understanding of the various philosophies you are arguing against why should I waste my time Your willingness to do any of this is directly correlated in my experience as to whether you are actually curious and open minded   gt Why do previous generation have more of a right to property than I do or my children for that matter   If they transformed the state of nature into something they used That seems like they have more of an interest in ownership of that than someone who is unborn and never had any hand in it   gt I don t believe the whole  property is theft side of the debate  What is taxation then Do you think taxation is voluntary   gt They decied on the basis of legal president and laws agreed upon  if not by the whole population then by representatives of the people  This is the cartoon picture of what happens Reality is much less picturesque   gt The law is applicable to all equally and subject to being changed if people feel it is not working fairly and it is limited by standards of human rights  Of course it isn t Is it applied to state actors Is it applied to cops When laws are not universal not universally applied or are written to accept significant portions of the population they re not universal How many of those bankers are in jail for mass fraud  Changed in which way Laws change all the time to restrict  human rights  They necessarily infringe on  human rights  Who changes them Certainly not you Certainly no individual You are a slave at the mercy of the majority You have nothing you have no rights and you have no property because they can legitimately take it all away from you under the guise of the state  and have    Please answer this question      gt I suspect that the actor with the greatest material and financial means would be able to dictate the term of any judgement and or dictate who the judgement was made by and  or be able to enforce the judgement through access to a superior police force  This is false and leads me to believe you haven t actually read much about Anarcho Capitalism  which is why I suggested you go to one of the other subReddits  The Machinery of Freedom by David Friendman     Man Economy and the State by Murray Rothbard     But wouldn t warlords take over     Fear of Monopoly    There are many more You can check out many of these topics FAQs top  criticisms etc  at mises org  And furthermore what happens  now under  this system    gt This seems like a horrible result to me and I ve not heard any arguments that have convinced me that it would not happen like this  Do the reading Join us at  r Anarcho Capitalism  r Anarcho Capitalism  Cheers 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m saying that support of private corporate supremacy is support of a system functionally equivalent to Russian communism Be careful what you wish for   Wat   We already have this it s called a corporatocracy or a plutocracy this is Americas current political system A monopoly can t exist in a free market Monopolies only exist because the government supports them   gt If you re truly in support of a system in which there is no guarantee of rights where what we know as rights for all are instead something that may be purchased from the authorities then just say it   We only have rights the government allows Without a government all rights are owned by all The police aren t there to protect your rights that s what the courts are for Private security are there to protect you and your property from violence  in our current system the police are there to enforce laws  if they don t do that they will go out of business

PoliticalDiscussion,I am a political philosophy major I am interested Thanks for the links but you haven t really furthered the discussion Why do previous generation have more of a right to property than I do or my children for that matter The big fault in my view of anarcho capitalism is its total relance on the concept of ownership and the rights of ownership These are far more fuzzy concepts than are pretended by many anarcho caps I don t believe the whole  property is theft side of the debate but it is no less reasonable than what anarcho caps seem to be arguing   I think that an anarcho cap society would devolve into debates about who owns what and these debates wouldn t be any more easily settled settled than they are today So what then What happens when two or more actors with compelling claims to ownership over a particular thing who each refuse to back down  In state based societies the state decides who is the owner They decied on the basis of legal president and laws agreed upon  if not by the whole population then by representatives of the people The law is applicable to all equally and subject to being changed if people feel it is not working fairly and it is limited by standards of human rights It s not a perfect system but its the best i think anyone has come up with  In an anarcho cap society I suspect that the actor with the greatest material and financial means would be able to dictate the term of any judgement and or dictate who the judgement was made by and  or be able to enforce the judgement through access to a superior police force   This seems like a horrible result to me and I ve not heard any arguments that have convinced me that it would not happen like this 
PoliticalDiscussion, Wait times is not the same as rationing The US rations by just denying claims The UK rations by determining that certain procedures aren t worth it  CA performs all necessary procedures however The wait times are only a result of their limited supply of doctors If they had drs  there would be no wait times 
PoliticalDiscussion,The argument centers around the idea that not every tax dollar given to the government is the same  You have to compare what the dollar is doing for the economy if it is given to the government to what it would be doing in the private sector if it wasn t collected as tax  The problem with tax cuts particularly bulk tax cuts paid out in one chunk is a questions of personal savings  The further up the tax brackets you go the more likely the money will go to personal savings instead of spending which is bad in an economic sense  This comes from a combination of a number of things including having more money available to save and on average being more disciplined with money  The short version is if a tax cut is given to a lower or middle class person particularly today when so many of those people are living paycheck to paycheck they are fairly like to spend a large chunk of it on something material which is good in terms of the economy  If it is given to an upper class person the money will probably go towards personal savings or paying off debt which is great from an individual sense but not nearly as good for the economy  So cutting  billion in tax cuts for the top  might lead to  billion in economic benefit but cutting  trillion in tax cuts for everyone else might only lead to to  billion  these numbers are a fictitious example I have no idea what the actual numbers are or even if the cuts for the lower and middle classes would have less benefit than the cuts on the upper class   That being said I have no idea how accurate the argument is  I think it ultimately comes down to the question of what the appropriate tax rate is for each bracket and I have no idea what the ideal levels are or how they compare to what s in place now 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Your anarcho capitalist paradise is unique in that it s one of the only systems ever conceived of where you can literally be too poor to afford to be a human being in the eyes of society  Bull Systems will be in place to help the poor Americans spend almost  billion a year on private charity donations and there are already businesses designed to help the poor In Singapore where they have a single payer health care system hospitals provide free health care to the poor   gt The market has decided consumers have decided that trading final arbitration rights in return for strict guarantees of rights is within most contexts an acceptable price   The market didn t decide this consumers didn t this this the government did   gt The evidence is in demonstrated preferece  the willingness of all such people who have the capability to choose other living arrangements  and there are a lot of other options to stay within their states and prosper  Again bull the  if you don t like it leave fallacy  false dichotomy is such a common argument yet so obviously fallacious I don t understand how people can keep using it seriously  If you don t like being raped move away from your rapy neighborhood   If you don t move and you are raped you have consented to that rape and it s your own damn fault  Thus you have no right to complain about rape or demand the cessation of rape  Thus you are a hypocrite if you stay but complain about rape   Law without Government Principles    Law without Government Conflict Resolution in a Free Society    Law without Government The Bargaining Mechanism  
PoliticalDiscussion,We need to somehow force politicians to keep their religious views to themselves An amendment to the constitution would help At the same time we need more morality Example I will not push my religion on you and you will not push yours on me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No then you ll be coerced by private entities into paying exorbitant amounts with hidden fees for protection that isnt always guaranteed and is of poor quality  Then they lose their business and die out The tyranny of the free market indeed Just look at what happened in Colorado Do you think anybody would pay into that police force  Law without Government Principles    Law without Government Conflict Resolution in a Free Society    Law without Government The Bargaining Mechanism  
PoliticalDiscussion, The King of Town says you re wrong  
PoliticalDiscussion,They re FREE THINKERS   but thanks for arguing semantics on the internet   
PoliticalDiscussion,No then you ll be coerced by private entities into paying exorbitant amounts with hidden fees for protection that isnt always guaranteed and is of poor quality What s more if you miss a payment you are essentially a free meal for all types of criminals who may rob beat or kill you with impunity until you catch up Then there s the neighborly tendency to externalize all damage and any increase in operational costs to the consumer meaning the cost of this mafioso protection would be highest in the places it is most needed leaving many out of the loop and likely turning those unprotected individuals into criminals making the area MORE dangerous and costs even MORE expensive  The tyranny of the free market indeed 
PoliticalDiscussion,MLK was not guided by religion he used it to guide others because he saw it as the best common ground from which he could lead the civil rights activists MLK was guided by hegel plato and boethius as per his secular education I feel this is an important distinction for the discussion at hand as religion was used in this example as a justification for tbe movement and adhesive for the masses rather than a principled guiding force 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you hear a pro oil anti regulation conservative malign environmentalism as a religion and you swallow that wholesale  Newsflash not everything that people think is important to a society s survival is a religion This is just a spin on the definition of environmentalism to encourage the religious right to exhibit a knee jerk opposition to alternative fuel sources and sustainable less environmentally destructive ways to produce goods and administer services Call something neo pagan and the neo christians will try to kill it with fire  Im not an environmentalist Im an average consumer who eats meat litters and doesnt recycle But i do not view the movement that seeks to keep out greed in check and ensure we dont end up with high pollution zones like in China to be a religion 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry i will try to write only populist opinions from now on conform conform conform   
PoliticalDiscussion,So  Those rich fat cats should pay their fair share too  People are starving while they live in opulence in LA 
PoliticalDiscussion,The opposition to birth control abortion and gay marriage is almost entirely religious Religious folk are responsible for the money we give to Israel land of God s chosen psychopaths Religion is why most public schools dont bother discussing evolution in depth in science classes In many states you cant buy booze on a Sunday or at all in certain counties thanks to religious groups   What s more there are megachurches in the US with congregations of tens of thousands all being urged by their pastors to vote their religious values and donate money to only the most godly  read social conservative candidates for office  I think it s clear to most Americans especially those of us in the bible belt that religion is a major governing force in the US If it wasn t santorum wouldnt even be entertaining the idea of running for president 
PoliticalDiscussion,Property rights of some form have to exist or there would be no method to determine who gets to use any given resource There has to be some method of fairly distributing resources and homesteading works fairly well since everyone has about equal opportunity to acquire things 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is the way it was supposed to be But an over reaching Federal Government has almost made state governments irrelevant This is in large part due to the th amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is what State government was supposed to be for  But an over reaching Federal Government has almost made state governments irrelevant   This is in large part due to the th amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say that the best way of counteracting the problem for the time being is for reddit to  require a post to go along with a downvote in this forum To counteract a flood contentious posts should be labeled as  points and the followup downvote post should be labeled as  counterpoint  and upvoting the counterpoint would have the same effect as downvoting the point into oblivion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah it can but we know a little more than you let on  We re nowhere near the tax rates where lowering them would increase tax revenue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Putting it in financial markets is only slightly better than stuffing it in their mattresses Not to mention speculation in gold  that s  exactly like stuffing mattresses  The companies that need capital don t get it from the markets anyway and the rest already don t know what to do with all the excess capital  though this might change now that the economy is picking up steam again 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I find the argument that the rich should pay more when the economy is hurting because they are most able to handle the burden compelling especially considering that there s a general trend in that the richer you get the greater your debt to society for being able to acquire that wealth tends to become  This kind of rationale makes absolutely no sense to me How do you become more  in debt to society as you become wealthier It should be the exact opposite considering the   richer you are the less you rely on government  and conversely the poorer you are the more government programs you rely on at the tax payer s expense  That s like saying a son is more  in debt to his mother for going out and becoming successful on his own than his unemployed  year old brother who still lives in her basement while both him and the mother live off the successful son s expense   How does that make sense in any way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really If those shortsighted idiots weren t coercing me to do things as the government they would form some other power structure to coerce me   like the church commune feudal system etc This particular conglomeration of shortsighted idiots called modern government is arguably the least offensive we as a species have found  Any organization is going to suffer a degree of waste incompetence and corruption Those problems tend to be cited as inevitabilities of government which is right but misses the larger point that they re inevitabilities of anything involving people As long as there are mechanisms in place to minimize those problems we could do worse than government 
PoliticalDiscussion,Off the top of my head the Syrian resistance might attempt to defraud the Syrian government  Basically any time you have an illegitimate government fraud employed against it can be moral  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why did people who were born before me have more of a right to property than I do now I don t have the option of being the first to manipulate anything There s nothing left for me  A noted issue with Anarcho Capitalism although it is not an issue with other various forms of stateless theories If you are interested on the topic I would suggest you take a look at  r geolibertarian  r geolibertarian   r mutualism  r anarchism  r Anarcho Capitalism and others I myself am a Voluntaryist There are many links in those subReddit I think you might find helpful  The answer to this question is one with property rights and not  the state    gt To based you political philosophy on the assertion that they have self evident answers seems incredibly unrealistic to me  It s not based on  self evident answers It is based on centuries of dialogue argumentation and criticisms  for all forms of anarchy    gt Aside from the other implications of putting anarcho capitialism into practice I think it falls down if it cannot clearly answer to owns what  Anarcho Capitalism absolutely answer who owns what It answers it immediately it is the basis of the theory You own yourself this is called  self ownership  Property rights in real property stem from this idea of self ownership You sound like you are interested and I would be glad to discuss this further with you if you are interested 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the country is loosing religious freedom to the intolerant secular Progressives and Liberals in govt   I imagine they will pass laws making it a crime for a church NOT to marry a gay couple Especially since they can make churches fund abortions and birth control  This will complete the Fascist tack our  Liberal govt is taking 
PoliticalDiscussion,When given the choice between empowering exploiting or neither of the poor there are enough unscrupulous people who would choose the second option  It is not in their best interest to empower people who they could possibly exploit 
PoliticalDiscussion, disable is a poor term  You can still turn off CSS use RES or downvote comments through the user s profile and submissions that appear on user s front pages will have a down arrow available  Removing the arrow in the CSS feed makes it harder to downvote   which might make people less likely to use the arrow unless they thought the post  really deserved it  
PoliticalDiscussion,Apologies Mistaken assumption 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you define what you mean when you say  guarantee because I m still not seeing a qualitative difference here 
PoliticalDiscussion,If there was anything in particular that brought this post about I forgot but it s just something that I had been noticing more and more in the subreddit People are so convinced in the rightness of their views that they don t believe anything other than theirs deserve anything more than a somewhat insulting and dismissive downvote For a subreddit based on discussion downvotes in place of actual replies is like trying to shake someone s hand and they leave you hanging It s a fucked up feeling   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And you believe statism solves this somehow  Can I ask where you are gleaning an advocacy position from anything I ve stated If you can do so I will hazard an answer to your question At the moment it is off topic and irrelevant 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  In what world do you imagine that they d care about people too poor to afford security or that this care would translate into a costly consumer choice that would select for companies that did so  And you believe statism solves this somehow  bear in mind tax funded wars in the face of widespread taxpayer opposition sanctions state corporate partnerships that result in evicted farmers poisoned land air and water etc etc  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If that s how you re using  guarantee then it s also true that no state has guaranteed rights  Simply not true The bar for solvency here is different than the bar for rights The only way it s even possible for a third party to guarantee rights is to guarantee recourse for rights being denied In that sense both states and private defense firms can do so The difference is that PDFs make it impossible for poor people to afford rights by pricing rights Charitable firms different from PDFs can t guarantee recourse 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Charity has never guaranteed solvency not at any point in history  If that s how you re using  guarantee then it s also true that  no state has guaranteed rights at any point in history You can t have it both ways 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  not guarantee I never said that  You have no interest in solvency of a proposed solution Here s how the long run is worse than even a sort of shitty state like the US Creating an underclass of fair game poor people will create an incentive to tear down the society which creates and predates on that underclass violently With guns Such has been the fate of every single society that has enabled the possibility to simply ignore and or predate on those too poor to afford rights You may say that the blood is not on your hands and they initiated the violence but it is queer to me that you would seek out a situation that is a net worse for everyone involved in the long run  gt what with everyone having  more money to play with  On what grounds do you claim that they would have  more money to play with A zero cost private defense firm That s economically impossible  Whatever extra money that people have will likely be used to further their own self interest rather than somehow change their value systems to care about working conditions and underclasses I have no reason to ever believe that the addition of marginal income creates value in charity and every reason to believe otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,The first thing is that the  drill baby drill mantra is complete and utter bullshit Many on the right  not all of course have this belief that the evil liberals are making gas prices go up because we like caribou When in reality the levels of gas in the US would make little to no changes to the overall price of gas in the US  Which is almost the cheapest in the industrialized world Gas is at least double the cost in Europe alone  We export it because most of the world pays much more for gas and the rest of the world is a pretty large market Free market at work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t citywide internet becoming a thing I thought I d heard about it a few years ago but nothing since then 
PoliticalDiscussion,The rest of the world was like you a lazy thinker who didn t read it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well no duh Hell there are people that are paid to alter discussions on social media such as reddit 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt    Our laws protecting minorities from discrimination are also morally based    No it is not It is rather based on a twisted sense of good Government doesn t tell you who to let into your house who to be friends with who to be in relationships with where to work where to shop where to live how to think who to hate who to love who to allow your kids to play with etc You are free to discriminate to your heart s content and associate with whom you please What is the moral basis for excluding private businesses who are really private citizens going about their private affairs from such freedoms If you refused to hire a certain individual to cut your grass or fix something in your home based on their race how would you feel if the government imposed penalties on you Is it moral to force someone to associate with someone 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Every single one of those works have been refuted by various AnCap authors Mises Rothbard Bastiat etc  Sound I guess the whole rest of the world was just sick that day or something 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correct Children who grow up with books in their homes are also more likely to have the financial resources to acquire them a higher standard of living and a more stable homelife as a result of this 
PoliticalDiscussion,This doesn t make any sense  Are you implying that people somehow get satisfaction or sustenance from downvoting people  
PoliticalDiscussion,So apparently your two vague arguments are infallible facts and my five exhaustively explained ones don t exist I give fucking scientific examples  Throwaway o s Law The more specific and explained something is the less true it is 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If you earnestly post your thoughts  unless it s a duplicate of someone else s post then you are promoting discussion  This is not true  You can look through many circle jerk posts on r politics and you can find some here on r politicaldiscussion as well who are neither off topic or trolling  Most of those posts have been downvoted accordingly  It s unrealistic and incorrect to say that simply writing your thoughts  however sincere prompts discussions 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If people happen to like it or a discussion surrounds it so much the better  This quote means that he doesn t necessarily mind if a discussion happens but that was not his original intent  I m not trying to rag on him  assuming it s a him but just posting your own thoughts doesn t necessarily entail prompting a discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let me put it like this   years ago telling a white man he was  equal to a non white man was hate speech Telling him that man should be able to procreate with his daughter was obscene  Sometimes the people speaking the hate speech are right Morals change   Yes the US made a moral statement from it s beginnings and codified it into it s ultimate law then made it so most of the citizens of the country had to cooperate to change it Past those basic moral statements everything else is and has been up for grabs   Restricting hate speech and making it illegal to speak words others might hate make it impossible for new ideas to be brought into the marketplace because they re abhorrent to the current moral setting  years ago such a law would have made it impossible to say that all men should be equal even the brown ones  Sometimes discord and instability is a good thing They sow change and change is necessary as history rolls on What is right now will not be right later  And I definitely defy that it doesn t add anything to public discourse It lets us know how some people feel and allows us to state again what our principles are and gives us a chance to speak out as to why we believe the hateful speaking person is wrong  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that s what libraries are for 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  This is in fact exactly what I meant 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My argument Some form of tax is necessary for the actual action of cooperation  And you did not substantiate this with facts and logic  Mere contradiction is not an argument  You have  no argument   gt The rest of the wall of text is made up of reasons why my argument is correct  I see none there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nice try Barnes and Noble 
PoliticalDiscussion,I figured that you needed a lot of explanation in order to prevent you from misunderstanding my argument but I guess I shouldn t have even tried  Your argument Taxes are not necessary for cooperation  My argument Some form of tax is necessary for the actual action of cooperation  Nowhere does tax cooperation come into it   Is that simplified enough for you   The rest of the wall of text is made up of reasons why my argument is correct 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s exactly my point my friend is just too arrogant to get that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the question is asking for how the structure and functions of the EU institutions  the Commission the Council the EP ECJ etc reflect integration  so how the policy they make reflects the current level and process of integration which would include the single market 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s actually a program that lends people books free of charge It s called a public library   I m just giving you shit It s actually a very noble idea I grew up in a house with TONS of books so I know how that feels and I believe it did benefit me a great deal Plus it s a hassle going to and from libraries especially if you don t own a car or can t afford extra gas money   Perhaps a program that gives books scheduled to be thrown away to a  book bank  it could work like a soup kitchen Just a thought 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s wrong with libraries 
PoliticalDiscussion,Internet access as a basic right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Giving people books isn t what s making them go to college Its not a direct correlation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wall of text with a lot of fallacies  the idea that taxation is a form cooperation which I already refuted is the central idea of your wall of text   I see no reason why I should respond  yet again to what I have already responded just because it s posted in humongous copypasta form 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt GDP also raised which is why it s a measure of  of GDP  When you use income taxes the  of GDP you tax rises faster than GDP in boom times and falls faster than GDP in bust times  That is why taxes were higher in  as a  of GDP than  despite no changes in the code and why they are lower today than in   And they are not cherry picked dates but years with similar levels of unemployment used as a rough proxy for macro economic conditions  Taxes have fluctuated around  of GDP since WW never exceeding     gt In addition you simply use  taxes without actually using individual income taxes the subject of your statement  Taxes as a whole are the only relevant measure and the Bush tax cuts changed much more than just income taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,No prohibiting public speech is outlawing it Prohibiting speech in broadcast is outlawing it  Like it or not pretty or not making it illegal to say something is a dangerous precedent You have to protect even the speech you don t like if you want free speech as a concept to work 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think a government can realistically remain morally neutral Our system of law implies some morality  all people are created equal everyone has certain rights etc are all moral propositions Our limits on obscenity imply additional morality Our laws protecting minorities from discrimination are also morally based You might say those laws serve the public interest sure  but what makes restricting hate speech not in the public interest It promotes discord and instability It may not advocate imminent lawless action but it doesn t add anything of value to public discourse 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wish people would stop assuming as a politician that just because someone contributes money to their campaign that they become a mindless zombie  So Soros gave Obama money to run How does that force Obama to do anything if Obama  disobeys  what s Soros going to do take away his birthday  It s silly and stupid that anyone could make the President of the US his puppet just by writing checks 
PoliticalDiscussion,you speak the truth  very doubtful that our society moves in that direction in our lifetimes   cowboy ism is too heavily ingrained in our culture 
PoliticalDiscussion,Another lazy thinker I m shocked I hope you change your mind Every single one of those works have been refuted by various AnCap authors Mises Rothbard Bastiat etc I simply don t care to waste time on someone who won t even put the time in read a few pages of an article I ll move on to someone else the issue with your comment is that you assume I am trying to show something to do This isn t necessarily true sure I would be glad to discuss philosophy with you but you are not open or curious to discussion my time is limited and there are others who are I discuss with you to target those that are reading to spread my ideas I seriously doubt you have read any of the basic works of philisophical thinking let alone others responses to them and you have made that quite obvious in this thread where you go out of your way to avoid more than short comments in response I will not waste time writing a grand treatise on Anarcho Capitalism for you to simply ignore or not read especially when they exist better elsewhere  Cheers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whether you re a revolutionary a factory owner or a little league hockey organizer there s one factor you can t afford to ignore the CoaseCost Ronald Coase was an American economist who changed everything with a paper he published in  called  The Theory of the Firm  Coase s paper argued that the real business of any organization was getting people organized A religion is a system for organizing people to pray and give money to build churches and pay priests or ministers or rabbis a shoe factory is a system for organizing people to make shoes A revolutionary conspiracy is a system for organizing people to overthrow the government Organizing is a kind of tax on human activity For every minute you spend doing stuff you have to spend a few seconds making sure that you re not getting ahead or behind or to one side of the other people you re doing stuff with The seconds you tithe to an organization is the CoaseCost the tax on your work that you pay for the fact that we re human beings and not ants or bees or some other species that manages to all march in unison by sheer instinct Oh you can beat the CoaseCost just stick to doing projects that you don t need anyone else s help with Like um   Tying your shoes  Nope not unless you re braiding your own shoelaces  Toasting your own sandwich  not unless you gathered the wood for the fire and the wheat for the bread and the milk for the cheese on your own  The fact is everything you do is collaborative   somewhere out there someone else had a hand in it And part of the cost of what you re doing is spent on making sure that you re coordinating right that the cheese gets to your fridge and that the electricity hums through its wires You can t eliminate Coase costs but you can lower it There s two ways of doing this get better organizational techniques  say  double entry bookkeeping  an Earth shattering th century invention that is at the heart of every money making organization in the world from churches to corporations to governments  or get better technology Take going out to the movies It s Friday night and you re thinking of seeing a movie but you don t want to go alone Imagine that the year was    how would you solve this problem Well you d have to find a newspaper and see what s playing Then you d have to call all your friends houses  no cellular phones remember  and leave messages for them Then you d have to wait for some or all of them to call you back and report on their movie preferences Then you d have to call them back in ones and twos and see if you could convince a critical mass of them to see the same movie Then you d have to get to the theater and locate each other and hope that the show wasn t sold out How much does this cost Well first let s see how much the movie is worth one way to do that is to look at how much someone would have to pay you to convince you to give up on going to the movies Another is to raise the price of the tickets steadily until you decide not to see a movie after all Once you have that number you can calculate your CoaseCost you could ask how much it would cost you to pay someone else to make the arrangements for you or how much you could earn at an after school job if you weren t playing phone tag with your friends You end up with an equation that looks like this  Value of the movie   Cost of getting your friends together to see it   Net value of an evening out That s why you ll do something less fun  stay in and watch TV but simple rather than going out and doing something more fun but more complicated It s not that movies aren t fun   but if it s too much of a pain in the ass to get your friends out to see them then the number of movies you go to see goes way down Now think of an evening out at the movies these days It s  PM on a Friday night and the movies are going to all start in the next  minutes You pull out your phone and google the listings sorted by proximity to you Then you send out a broadcast text message to your friends   if your phone s very smart you can send it to just those friends who are in the neighborhood   listing the movies and the films They reply all to one another and after a couple volleys you ve found a bunch of people to see a flick with You buy your tickets on the phone But then you get there and discover that the crowds are so huge you can t find each other So you call one another and arrange to meet by the snack bar and moments later you re in your seats eating popcorn So what Why should anyone care how much it costs to get stuff done Because the CoaseCost is the price of being superhuman Back in the old days   the very very old days   your ancestors were solitary monkeys They worked in singles or couples to do everything a monkey needed from gathering food to taking care of kids to watching for predators to building nests This had its limitations if you re babysitting the kids you can t gather food If you re gathering food you might miss the tiger   and lose the kids Enter the tribe a group of monkeys that work together dividing up the labor Now they re not just solitary monkeys they re groups of monkeys and they can do more than a single monkey could do They have transcended monkeyness They are supermonkeys Being a supermonkey isn t easy If you re an individual supermonkey there are two ways to prosper you can play along with all your monkey pals to get the kids fed and keep an eye out for tigers or you can hide in the bushes and nap pretending to work only showing up at mealtimes From an individual perspective it makes sense to be the lazy jerk monkey In a big tribe of monkeys one or two goof offs aren t going to bankrupt the group If you can get away with napping instead of working and still get fed why not do it But if everyone does it so much for supermonkeys Now no one s getting the fruit no one s taking care of the kids and damn I thought you were looking out for the tigers Too many lazy monkeys plus tigers equals lunch So monkeys   and their hairless descendants like you   need some specialized hardware to detect cheaters and punish them before the idea catches on and the tigers show up That specialized hardware is a layer of tissue wrapped around the top of your brain called the neo cortex   the  new bark  The neo cortex is in charge of keeping track of the monkeys It s the part of your brain that organizes people checks in on them falls in love with them establishes enmity with them It s the part of your brain that gets thoroughly lit up when you play with Facebook or other social networking sites and it s the part of your brain that houses the local copies of the people in your life It s where the voice of your mother telling you to brush your teeth emanates from The neocortex is the CoaseCost as applied to the brain Every sip of air you breathe every calorie you ingest every lubdub of your heart goes to feed this new bark that keeps track of the other people in your group and what they re doing whether they re in line or off the reservation The CoaseCost is the limit of your ability to be superhuman If the CoaseCost of some activity is lower than the value that you d get out of it you can get some friends together and do it transcend the limitations that nature has set on lone hairless monkeys and become a superhuman So it follows that high Coase costs make you less powerful and low Coase costs make you more powerful What s more big institutions with a lot of money and power can overcome high Coase costs a government can put  soldiers onto the battlefield with tanks and food and medics you and your buddies cannot  TLDR Tax is inevitable in any organization Organization is necessary to accomplish  superhuman tasks like tying your shoes and toasting bread Therefore taxes are key to becoming  superhuman  which most people would deem to be a worthwhile trade off 
PoliticalDiscussion,I just don t see that as true Can you provide examples 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s not mix morality up with religion I think Moses may have gotten that confusion started by using God to enforce basic morality that is obvious to most of us in good mental health and character Later on rulers in Europe used religion to keep order Now that we have law enforcement there is no need for that connection 
PoliticalDiscussion,The difference is also legal 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government doing it yes  The Constitution is constructed to allow unfettered free speech The only exceptions to this have been dangerous speech which provokes others into harming themselves or imminently harming others  I do not think we should go messing with that for moral purposes What is hate speech to you might be me expressing opinion to me The government is supposed to be a morally neutral body based on laws and if you have if reflecting morals the question then arises as to whose morals you follow and why those should be superior to those of any other free harmless person  You might despise hate speech but it has value because it adds to the public square and allows people to discuss ideas however repugnant To others it isn t even hate speech and therefore would be oppressive to limit it at all  Leave it alone Utilize your right as a free American to ignore it or fight it with your own words 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is a difference between taxing their income and their business  Especially since these Hollywood types are the first to cheerlead for new taxes  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The rise in taxes was caused by the economic boom  GDP also raised which is why it s a measure of  of GDP But your only proof remains that on two cherry picked years  of GDP was the same while ignoring historical trends etc In addition you simply use  taxes without actually using individual income taxes the subject of your statement 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tax law in  was identical to   The rise in taxes was caused by the economic boom not tax rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t mean to imply that money saved is simply taken out of the economy just the impact it has on the economy is reduced from what it would be somebody went out and bought some good or service 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a fucking dangerous road to go down  I think restricting speech at all  including obscenity is immoral and bad especially if you don t like the message 
PoliticalDiscussion,When people put money into  personal savings it goes into financial market It either goes into a bank the stock market or used to purchase municipal bonds Whatever it does that money lowers the cost for companies to borrow money to spend on new capital  buildings machinery etc or for individuals to borrow money to start new businesses The lower cost to borrow money the more loans taken out the more corporate purchases more jobs created  Source My introductory macroeconomics class  
PoliticalDiscussion,Truism of the EU itself  What I can gather from the question is more questions  How does the structure of the EU s institutions reflect the integration of the EU  How do institutions reflect integration treaties and the intention of integration   Are they effective and more on the centralisation of the EU s institutions 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no such thing as  anarcho  capitalism The state doesn t just disappear when you call it private and replace policemen with rented mercenaries Also anarchists do not advocate for totalitarian institutions state or private or support the idea of people renting themselves to anybody  The only developed market societies that have existed have been state capitalist If you take away the state but want to keep the capitalists you just have violence and order enforced by the likes of Guzm n Loera 
PoliticalDiscussion,For the airwaves I imagine the FCC would have that power if there were a law prohibiting hate speech from being broadcast That would be analogous to what they already do for obscenity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is this in relation to the Single Market I can answer if that s the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,So only after the other party has violated the force threats or fraud rule its okay Taxpayers on the whole dont use force threats or fraud why is it okay to use it agains them unprovoked 
PoliticalDiscussion,Where I differ from the Democrats is mostly on personal freedoms like favoring marijuana legalization against NDAA PATRIOT etc  and against DMCA current copyright law  I also favor much more drastic military cuts than the Dems and higher spending on pure research NASA and the arts 
PoliticalDiscussion,While it may be an assumption I think it s one that holds a large amount of truth Let s face it blacks and hispanics vote Democrat in much larger percentages While it may be harmful to group minorities it is the reality in which we live in   Additionally it may not even be grouping based upon ideology party For instance by splitting a minority neighborhood issues that most affect those communities specifically will be lost By not being able to vote for a representative that simply looks like or has had the same experiences as a voter constituents in the district will feel disconnected to their representative

PoliticalDiscussion,haha i love how the  backed by research bit in the title refers to websites
PoliticalDiscussion,why are so many simple questions answered with  words now that s a question   
PoliticalDiscussion,Because conservatives use fear as propaganda not comedy
PoliticalDiscussion,We are so far in hole we need to do both now Just cutting benefits or just raising taxes isn t going to do it   The tax increase is very easy just let the bush cuts expire it s quite possible that will happen purely out of the ineptitude of congress    The cuts will be hard however because no one will let anybody touch SS or Medicare  The military really could be cut by  tomorrow without it really effecting daily ops much as it is the most wasteful portion of our government    it s the only branch of government who has to fight to get LESS funding     should really be a planned recession to get our fiscal house in order  If that were to happen then this won t end up being a wasted decade 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,Redefining certain things as not illegal  like Marijuana  Of course this isn t the only thing  other things mentioned are more lenient punishments parole etc  but a lot of non violent offenders are marijuana users possessors who don t do anything else illegal 
PoliticalDiscussion,The choice is between one group which can explain problems but have no solutions  And the other group which has solutions but it doesn t solve the problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well if you re one day late you get waterboarded until you do pay  If you re two days late I m not sure  No one has ever survived that long so it s never come up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Excellent question   my grandson is starting college this summer I m pondering telling him to load up on student loans because the system is  too big to fail   I believe that if enough ex students default on the loans and the accumulated interest the Federal Govt MUST order  forgiveness   As with an increasing number of bad mortgage loans he could just walk away from the debt under a govt program    What alternative does the Govt have Forced government service  Off to Labor Camps with all the history majors I don t think so 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it just smelled like fish in here so I checked the fish market and sure enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well collectivism  communism in our sociopolitical culture so I don t see our country getting any less individualistic any time soon 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was meant as a generalization about which party an individual may choose to support if they want to be a part of a party that makes large differences in our system not about the inability of individuals to choose what their elected official does when in office The limitations of the people s power in the decisions a representative makes is a whole other issue
PoliticalDiscussion,Still really need that context otherwise it is just meaningless jargon 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would have to be an incredible idiot to think that anyone addressing your  argument would ignore the reality that most gang members are poor minorities  You are merely playing with semantics to get around outright proclaiming the superiority of the white man  Goodluck getting your  book published

PoliticalDiscussion,Basically the death penalty in my opinion is moral insofar as certain crimes ought to be punishable by death  I ve really got no problem with serial killers or child murderers getting executed  The devil is in the details however because actually proving that someone committed those crimes is not possible  The justice system can only prove  beyond a reasonable doubt  which is an extremely shifty definition particularly when the personal prejudices of the jurors or judge are involved  i e all white juries in the South   If someone is imprisoned even for an extremely long time and is proven innocent after the fact they can be compensated for the wrongs done against them  If someone is executed they cannot be compensated and the risk of executing an innocent person is simply too great to implement the death penalty 
PoliticalDiscussion,that reuters article was written hours after the attack  And i m not sure what the relevance of your second quote is supposed to be additionally the next sentence from wiki is  The probe team later said there were no eye witnesses just secondhand witnesses and concluded there wasn t enough evidence to confirm more than one shoote   So I m still not seeing this as a pr blunder for the whitehouse 
PoliticalDiscussion,This  The state still has a monopoly on the use of force  The only difference is how the state applies such force and who is uses to do so  Nonetheless privatization raises concerns as outsourced force inherently has less oversight  Until private interests can unilaterally use force without reprimand the dynamic hasn t  really changed 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with Soros so fine with me
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That sounds nice but it s not really true I can t remember where I saw the polling numbers to link them here but generally people are in favor of paying higher taxes themselves when they are linked to specific programs they are interested in   Wow good job at changing it so that you made it sound like people want to pay more taxes Yes people would pay for a tax fee that goes to something they want but that isn t the federal income tax my friend 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree that an algorithm is a pretty good way to go Personally I can agree with the shortest split line method However we have to acknowledge that in the act of choosing we introduce the possibility of corruption 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right and since that is the case we should just pick one  fair algorithm and stick with it I like shortest splitline myself because it s the easiest to understand I don t know which party it would favor  and I don t care 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the rich will still be rich when they pay those taxes the middle and lower classes will no longer be they will be lower and in poverty

PoliticalDiscussion,Don t get me wrong I have good amount of animosity towards Soros for what he s done in the past but I don t buy into conspiracy stuff like this People like to have this illusion that the president is ultimately controlled by outsiders with sinister motives but if you just sit back and think about it the chances of that are slim to none It makes a good story like most conspiracies do but that s all it usually is fictional sensationalism that some people just can t get enough of There is a reason why most conspiracy theorists believe in more than one conspiracy

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The biggest holders of and players in the gold market are central banks   Uh they don t participate in the markets the same way normal speculators do   gt There is no way that there has been enough speculation in gold to have any kind of perceivable impact on the US economy  Exactly my point It doesn t help anyone except other gold speculators  those who bought earlier There won t always be a greater fool though     gt Companies that need capital often get it from venture capital or private equity firms places the rich are much more likely to put their money in than the middle class  That much is true   gt companies and banks have cash reserves that far exceed what the rich have  Well someone owns these companies so whatever the companies have the owners of the companies have  But it seems you re again agreeing with me There is very little economic benefit to people putting their surplus capital in financial markets right now  Compared to people buying shit so demand increases so businesses can expand and hire people so these people can also go back to buying shit   gt Increasing the top marginal income tax rate isn t going to have any impact because it doesn t tax the companies and banks that have huge cash reserves   Unfortunately you can t properly raise taxes on businesses without capital leaving the US see all the money waste caused by US states trying to outbid each other with low business taxes Helps no one Instead you raise taxes on the people getting paid well by the business if there are better opportunities elsewhere these people will leave  let s say for a gig in Hong Kong or get a raise  I m all for raising cap gains  more would cause no problem at all 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt When these people talk about paying more in taxes for programs they specifically favor do they mean just them or do they wan t higher earners to pick up a disproportional amount of the pie  Well obviously taxes aren t individual usage fees But the questions  and I apologize profusely again for not being able to find the link were specifically asking if the individual being polled was willing to pay more in taxes if it meant saving or implementing various programs And more people than you might think would say yes  obviously varying percentages of people said  yes depending on the popularity of the program    gt point is that the deficit cannot be reasonably reduced with only millionaire billonaire dollars because there aren t enough millionaires billionaires  Spending cuts too Plus the economic recovery will result in growing revenues   gt Also  for capital gains is too low That is another problem  Agreed but I m  positive that this fact plays into the public polling on this issue there s no other way that Romney  for example has such a low effective tax rate without it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you infer what I meant and answer the question 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think it is but some people could argue that  OK But we agree that a PDF is under no moral obligation to provide any coverage to those who can t pay and therefore those who can t pay are non persons  gt Yes they settled out of court but that s not enough  It is if the bringer of the suit says it is

PoliticalDiscussion,To narrow the scope of this discussion lets just focus on discussing climate change the related science and the Republicans attitude toward it  Otherwise we ll just have too much to discuss  When Al Gore released  An Inconvenient Truth in  the idea of  anthropogenic climate change was not new    George W Bush and many other Republicans stated that he opposed the Kyoto protocol because it  exempted emerging markets like India and China from compliance     Prior to the films release in  the Republican attitude was already against increased government intervention related to environmentalism     By  almost  years after the film s release  support for environmentalism by Republicans had slipped further    The tread I m trying to show with my  minutes of research is that yes post Gore  predominately marked by his documentary  Republican attitudes towards global warming have been less positive or less concerned however one important caveat is that they were never that strongly positive to begin with  Of course the fact that political contributions by energy and natural resource companies those who would be most effected by reform tackling climate change  overwhelming side with the Republican party might have something to do with it     However the focus on the economy also plays a role in this fewer people are going to say the environment is a top concerned when they re unemployed and their home is being foreclosed on  So while the trends do indicate that yes Gore s impact on the Republicans hasn t been beneficial to overall cause but as usual there are other concerns and the negative impact due to him injecting partisanship into the issue may not have been so great 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There would be competing courts and agencies If an agency commits a crime   Not providing a product pro bono is not nor should it be a crime Not even I who isn t an  ancap  would say that companies should be forced to provide their services in all cases If you make it a crime for an agency to not work for free you are violating their property rights and autonomy  gt Because nothing happened to them  Any one of us could have collectively boycotted a company like that gone completely around the state and used the same market processes you are relying upon here and had Shell shut down in a matter of days No one did No one even came close Why do you think they d do it in a free market  gt When the only options are to move to a place where we can t live or live in an oppressive society  You can live outside of those societies you call oppressive Like may ventures in securing what you want it s  difficult  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You seem to be under the impression that private courts would have a  law that they enforced on the very agencies that enforce court decisions and that you know specifically what this law will entail Where are you getting this idea  There would be competing courts and agencies If an agency commits a crime they are brought to court and if they refuse to follow through with the court order another agency will enforce it   gt And people still bought their gas in the millions of barrels People are more than willing to decry a company but they aren t willing to do so if it costs them  Because nothing happened to them because they are protected by the state   gt That doesn t mean I advocate for everything the state does but to say it s  forced on them is to ignore a whole vast array of human action  When the only options are to move to a place where we can t live or live in an oppressive society what other option is there but to change the society we live in

PoliticalDiscussion,Respect for the dead and careful consideration of other peoples practices When a person is insulting for the sole purpose of being insulting they are using free speech as a shield to hide behind not as a weapon to use against real enemies   America s Most Hated Family   illustrates this point quite well  Verbal abuse at tiems also hides behind free speech When a child gets kit everybody cries but when one is emotionally and verbally abused they often don t get noticed  Here   is what it can do  Whilst I agree speech should be completely free I am just saying some people abuse this freedom and flaunt it when they should repect it

PoliticalDiscussion,It s etymological soup if you take a serious look at the history  Anarchists do not want workplace  rulers and oppose a society where people are forced to rent themselves to markets as fungible resources If you think this constitutes individual liberty or that capital is fine and dandy anarchism is basically out along with anything that uses the word  voluntary  When people lease out their labor it isn t an exercise of will It s an  exercise of necessity Choice is not freedom If they had the means to sell the products of their labor most people would   This flows right out of classical liberalism by the way   which was thoroughly anti capitalist even when making arguments in favor of markets Saying anarcho capitalism is like saying  vegan cannibalism though The first word contradicts the second  This ideology you re describing whatever its nuances used to be called laissez faire So maybe minarchoneoliberal is a better descriptor   even though it s still neither liberal nor new

PoliticalDiscussion,Well yes but the angle they are taking this this particular debate it that more censorship on the internet is a good thing I take issue with the way their documentary is put together they back very little up and do not represent the internet community in a realistic way    One example of the skewed nature of this documentary happens when they ask a  troll some questions face to face he gives his answers and leaves and immediately they voice over saying he sent a letter the next day saying the opposite of what he said in the interview   No picture no proof just that one of several examples 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Could I see the  Constitution is only valid when convenient decision  Patriot Act NDAA those are some recent examples   gt but that has nothing to do with whether rights are guaranteed   We don t need a government to grant and guarantee rights That s like saying a slave master protects and guarantees the rights of his slaves How would our rights be in trouble without the government The same protection is available without it The government is the only thing challenging your rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,All of the things you mention are unambiguously illegal  It is not hard to not speed  it isn t hard to not download files from bittorrent  You are basically objecting to getting caught for crimes you freely admit committing  Accidentally committing a crime is more akin to parking somewhere you aren t allowed to park but only because the sign saying so had fallen over 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Private defense services offer their services regardless  What incentive do they have to incur costs without guarantee of pay Secondly this isn t fire fighting Investigating say a murder or theft can take months of dedicated employees No sane company would do that pro bono on the scale necessary  gt Expatriation isn t a choice   Here s some resources for you     gt You can t just say  I m no longer a citizen  and then things magically turn out how you want  Much like any private example The market doesn t provide your ideal circumstance nor is it limitless choice without consequences I m not sure why this is or should be a standard  gt A false dichotomy is exactly what like it or leave it is  My argument once again wasn t  like it or leave it  It was demonstrated preference an economic theory widely subscribed to by Austrian economists and most mainstream economists 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is the quality of response that justifies this subreddit Good job 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would be surprised  
PoliticalDiscussion,The term  libertarianism describes a broad and vaguely defined group of people who seek individual liberty Though it used to describe a form of communist anarchism today it includes such ideologies as classical liberalism and anarcho capitalism  I find that the term anarcho libertarianism best describes the philosophy which I believe to be true It s about more than the abolition of the state and an economic system  which rules out anarcho capitalism   libertarianism is too vague and voluntar y ism is associated with opposition to voting Therefore I prefer the term anarcho libertarianism to describe my views as the term  libertarianism is usually associated with  right  libertarianism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Speeding springs to mind as does being seen on camera with other people On the Internet people download things illegally all the time most do it without ever considering the possibility that it is illegal Not to mention the wide array of porn copywrited images and texts and even websites which offer services which are slightly looked down upon  Prosititutes on craiglist and Sites where you can buy essays 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What is your explaination for why corporate income taxes went from   in  to   in  I can cherry pick years too  income moving from corporate taxes to personal income most likely  But you re missing the point  I m giving you that personal  income taxes went down but since overall taxes didn t go down they must have gone up somewhere else  maybe excise taxes maybe something else  Moreover if you look at the  nominal trend line   taxes are right where you would expect them to be 
PoliticalDiscussion,This has nothing to do with free speech What you re arguing is that some BBC reporting isn t politically neutral that doesn t reduce people s ability to express contrasting viewpoints 
PoliticalDiscussion,one thing I see over and over Despite the clear history and record Republicans down vote and refuse any notion Obama s policies are extension of Bush s   Either they never realized how bad Bush policies were or they have no integrity and believe in their own reality 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Can I ask what systems will be in place to provide private defense services to people who cannot afford private defense services If we are not obligated to do it why do you think it would be done If you say  I can t give you the specifics the market will decide  that s all well and good but the market already does a poor job of reliably mobilizing the poor up the ladder or protecting them from victimization so you ll accept my apology if I simply don t accept that explanation at face  Private defense services offer their services regardless Just like private fire fighter services You put out he fire first you charge later Also it s not the markets fault that the poor are poor It s the governments fault We don t have a free market We live in a corporatocracy   gt As far as I know expatriation is still legal for all citizens of the US so your choices are not being constrained by strict force   gt Demonstrated preference is worlds different from  like it or leave it  I m concerned you don t understand my argument If you have any questions I would happily answer them  You re confused Expatriation isn t a choice There s no where on the planet a person can go to live the way they want and you can t legally go there anyways without all the necessary paperwork Most western countries now require you to have a bachelors degree if you want citizenship You can t just say  I m no longer a citizen  and then things magically turn out how you want  A false dichotomy is exactly what like it or leave it is you re offering two options as the only options when there are plenty of others There s like it leave it change it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hereby acknowledge it 
PoliticalDiscussion,What outside information The unproven assertion you are a  political philosophy student  In what High school Sorry if I don t give much credance to some assertion and subsequent argument to authority by someone on the interwebs 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I would argue that most of the largest companies in the US have experienced this phenomenon Why should security be any different  You really don t know what you re talking about That happens because they lobby to pass regulations that make it almost impossible for competition to grow They also perform regulatory capture so they can attack the competition directly   gt Corporations of any stripe are worried about the bottom line first and customer satisfaction second  Only because they can t be held liable for their actions because they have the state protecting them 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d feel much better about a program that paid poor people to get sterilized 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Local govts are not equipped to deal with poverty   They certainly are a lot more equipped than the federal government  The reason is because poverty is not one uniform thing  It means different things to different people and the best the feds can do is push one size fits all solutions onto problems that are clearly not compatible with that type of thinking  I could buy an argument that state involvement may occasionally be useful for communities that are too terrible to even care for themselves but at some point you have to ask if it s better to just letting dying communities die so that people can get on with life  No state is so poor that they can t provide aid to the poor and they will definitely do an infinitely better job of it than the horrors that come out of DC 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok I m going to stop replying now Try not to let any outside information penetrate your thinking 
PoliticalDiscussion,  You can lead a horticulture but you can t make her think       Dorothy Parker  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Higher than the late s  Doesn t make it more or less relevant It was a weak attempt to justify cherry picking You simply claimed that unemployement was a macroeconomic indicator of the overall economy I picked  years  before tax cuts  after with unemployment   different    gt Then what is your explanation for why corporate income taxes and payroll taxes went up as a  of gdp given the laws weren t changed  What is your explaination for why corporate income taxes went from   in  to   in  I can cherry pick years too   Payroll taxes  social insurance retirement went down from   to    
PoliticalDiscussion,US usage Libertarian anarchist conservative and a ton of other words that followed the exact path that George Orwell described  A libertarian is simply an advocate of liberty and an opponent of hierarchy concentration of power and coercion There s no need to concatenate it with  anarcho   anarchism is simply the most uncompromising libertarian position that calls for the elimination of both capitalism and state in favor of stateless government and workplace self management It s a broad category but it certainly doesn t include the very things it s always stood in opposition to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you really think it s the presence of the books that matters or the attitudes of parents with books towards parenting when compared to parents without books  I m going with the latter  An education via books is effectively free when considering libraries and what s public domain 
PoliticalDiscussion,Death to his enemies handouts to his tribal allies 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt   is high  Higher than the late s   gt Except looking at personal income taxes says the opposite  Then what is your explanation for why corporate income taxes and payroll taxes went up as a  of gdp given the laws weren t changed  I contend that bush changes chased money into those areas since overall revenue remained the same  Do you have a better theory 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Which part of  constitution was unclear to you  TL DR  That is my guess 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you re complaining about the modern usage of the term  libertarian  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt unemployment was still high    is high    gt was picked over  because it was exactly  years before   Why is that relevant Is  years more relevant than  years That s simply a specious justification for cherry picking   gt it s just more proof that the bush tax changes weren t significant enough  Except looking at personal income taxes says the opposite 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Public Library System 
PoliticalDiscussion, It s like etymological lentil soup Take  some words   run them through the  dissociated press   make bumper stickers 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d tell them to go to library 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not as stupid as the state wants you to think 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pathetic kiddo You started the ad hom attacks against myself and others in the thread and now you want to complain about them mixed in with other points Okay   gt Why would I being a political philosophy student  I suspect this is untrue If this was true you wouldn t have started the questions about the practicality of the theory You would have questioned the basis and the argument This leads me to believe you a are not a political philisophy student  and or b are a lazy thinker In either case it doesn t particularly matter Don t complain about ad hom attacks when you are the first to start it   gt My laziness defo proves you right  I know 
PoliticalDiscussion,Racial gerrymandering is ABSOLUTELY legal as long as you don t use it in favor of white voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem I see is there is very little line to cross What counts as free speech is vast and what isn t covered under it is very little So I don t think people even come close to crossing the line

PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Man arrested over allegedly racist Twitter remarks about Fabrice Muamba    Is this what we re supposed to be gunning for 
PoliticalDiscussion,and MSNBC is the Dems propaganda mouthpiece  It still doesn t answer my question about what you propose be changed in the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,I get that people have a tendency to overstep the line and to some extent we use the title of  free speech to justify our actions Halaku has a point However Free speech is the greatest tool the public has to enacting change in our government and society Letting somebody regulate that is counter productive and paradoxical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which part of  congress shall make no law   abridging the freedom of speech was unclear to you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Does anyone honestly think that restricting hate speech in public would be a bad thing  You better believe I do and a whole host of other people How do you plan to pass a plan like this How do you define hate speech Will you only attack stereotypical haters like whites or are you going to go after gays blacks and other minorities as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Poor people don t not read books because they re poor they re poor because they aren t interested in books 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fox isn t a news source It s Republican propaganda disguised as entertainment

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why not  and  Or  and    unemployment was still high   was picked over  because it was exactly  years before    gt But you re also including corporate taxes which the EGTRRA didn t change The numbers I am using roll up estate capital gains and income taxes into one number  If they didn t change then including them or not doesn t matter  If the rules didn t change but the amount of money collected did it s just more proof that the bush tax changes weren t significant enough to alter the post ww trend just moved money around within the code 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ask Fred Phelps 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt some Americans abuse  What are you talking about How do you abuse free speech 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Fox News  Because there wasn t biased sensationalist newspapers during the s  I m interested in what changes to the first amendment you propose to deal with a news source you don t agree with

PoliticalDiscussion,It makes one want a time machine If America s Founding Fathers could see AK s Fox News and the aftermath of the Civil War what would the Bill of Rights look like today 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt   The current situation    in theory    is a guarantee of state protected rights regardless of one s ability to pay in exchange for a mandatory payment based on one s ability to pay    Does this extend beyond theory into reality 
PoliticalDiscussion,Im from England so I get what you are saying But if start censoring something there is no telling what we can really lose from the internet Everywhere you go in England you are being watched by CCTV Makes you frightened to accidentally commit a crime or be mistaken for doing one If the internet turned into something like that it would lose its soul so to speak   I read on Reddit the other day that one company was offered a chance to buy the internet Maybe somebody else could link that because I cant find it But if the internet was privatised it would be the same Comments would be taken down left right and centre you wouldn t be able to trust what you see because you know other people are editing and removing and changing stuff to make it appear how they think it should appear
PoliticalDiscussion, Case in point     As an American it absolutely baffles me that there are liberal democracies where you can get arrested for using a slur on twitter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Pathetic mate Ad hom attacks on me being lazy because you refise to debate substance Yeah I ve not read any of those books Why would I being a political philosophy student My laziness defo proves you right 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s no  fallacies   Anarchists libertarians have always been anti capitalists for reasons clearly archived in centuries of literature You re not Rothbard understood these reasons well but still convinced a bunch of suburbanites that they re railing against  the man by screaming that taxes are theft He s even gloated about the successful doublespeak after setting up the CATO PR mill with Charles Koch 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even bad ideas promote discussion It s pretty much impossible to come up with an original idea That s why we have sayings like  The Simpsons did it which itself echos the sentiment   There s nothing new under the Sun  which is at least as old as Old Testament No one is the first to have that terrible idea so a discussion of why it was a bad idea is extremely valuable to others that might have had that same bad idea and get to read refutations There s another old saying you can lead a redditor to discussion but you can t make him upvote a well written idea he disagrees with Posts that should promote discussion might be downvoted to Oblivion or Savengard or Hircine s hunting grounds and posts that a circlejerky and shouldn t promote discussion might prompt someone who agrees to respond with an intelligent thought that adds to the discussion My point is that Reddit is not a perfect meritocracy If it were my point would be perfectly valid To truly promote discussion on Reddit yes you do need to game the system But good discussion should arise from any earnestly written opinion according to Rediquette 
PoliticalDiscussion,Include heretofore limited access scientific journals and you re on 
PoliticalDiscussion,So many fallacies   you should know better by now really 
PoliticalDiscussion,The British doesn t have the same  FUCK YOU I CAN SAY WHAT I FUCKING WANT attitude towards free speech that some Americans abuse   The Internet is without national borders true But that doesn t mean it defaults to American values in regards to the Bill of Rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,A PC with Internet access in every bedroom is a worthy goal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Laziness equals laziness You haven t read many if any of these books The last comment was just a silly quip because you didn t have an actual response to my comment My suspicions confirmed again  You won t even spend the  minutes to read a short cited essay about a pointed question you had You probably didn t even look at the links I provided But honestly I love being proven right thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,I see your Internet access and raise you a National Digital Library that is free to use includes everything registered with the Library of Congress and pays royalties directly to authors and artists  I d pay higher taxes for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Disagreement equal lazyness Sound 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like this 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think we ought to make it a right  That defies the definition of a right If there existed no one to provide you with education would your right be violated  You re referring to a  privilege  I promise that s what the thing you want is called  And you didn t answer my question What kind of PC does everyone get Can t we just have a center like a public internet cafe so that people can come in and use the internet rather than  giving  million people a computer 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes and this is how it should be fixed   Using GIS software and a comprehensive census data set an automated application will use existing lot lines streets and any other planimetric features to create a national grid that is within a certain tolerance Each square in the grid will represent the same number of people thus the squares will be smaller in urban areas and larger in rural areas This grind lines will be redrawn every  years The new grid will be drawn in the same method as the previous grid except that the existing grid lines will be added to the planimetric data and given extra weight so that the new grid will try to conform as much as possible to the old one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends on what you define as  poverty   In Appalachia people are used to a different level of existence than in Beverly Hills but as long as they are warm and fed they are just dandy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think better public libraries and public transportation to them would be a better idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,Child support is only in cases of a termination of an actual relationship e g divorce annulment etc Child support works both ways actually If the mother doesn t want the child and the father does she must pay child support if determined by the court 
PoliticalDiscussion,I suggest you read Freakonomics  There is a part in there where the author discusses this very program set up by none other than Rod Blagojevich  He set up a program where every kid got a bunch of books but in the end it still failed  Why  Because you still have to have parents who are invested in the child to read those books to them  Its not enough to have books lying around because we don t absorb the knowledge through osmosis    The reason that the researchers found the results that they did was because children who have a lot of books typically have resources  ie money which typically dictates a higher standard of living  This also means that if they have books they are more likely to have parents who think reading is important    Seriously though if you like this you should buy  or pick up from your library the book Freakonomics  Its really well written and the author does a bunch of different studies like this  Some are more fun to read and see the connections than others but I would recommend it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s called child support The courts force the father to pay for the expenses of the child even if he wants no part in the child s life And please note I m not using this as an argument against child support I m using it as a comparable analogy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m talking about the brackets themselves with the applicable income levels  i e    XXk for the first bracket  XXk  YYk for the second etc  One of the biggest changes with the Bush tax cuts was that he significantly lowered the upper bounds of the brackets not just the rates themselves  Edit It appears that I accidentally a word in my first post making it really hard to understand what I meant      Hopefully this clears that up 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is it misleading It s completely factual Is   misleading Like I said you can argue that pre Bush tax cuts were slightly  more progressive but the tax rates today are certainly still very progressive  Edit and that chart  does include the rates for all brackets Did you even look at it 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the mother wants the child and the father doesn t why would the father pay for  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,That chart is incredibly misleading because the bush cuts didn t only lower the tax rates they significantly shifted the lower brackets so that more higher earners paid a lower rate  It s important to include the income brackets when talking about the Bush tax cuts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who decides what is  hate speech   What the fuck is  hate anyways  And why do we care about banning it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even the guns thing has become a media flop   they tried to make it into some racist anti gun thing yet it s become apparent that it wasn t racially motivated and the person may have been in the legal right to shoot the kid  depending on the outcome of the Grand Jury of course  
PoliticalDiscussion,I never really gave the whole its my body it is my decision its broad denand   were not talking about your leg and I m saying you have to amputate it You are a woman and by genetic lottery you were as such You don t get special consideration bc you don t have a y chromasome and because I have one There are no handicaps Life is temporary but absolute Allowing the parents the option of being involved at their will also allows for something  its my body its my choice idea doesn t fairness  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Putting it in financial markets is only slightly better than stuffing it in their mattresses  How so  Most of the truly rich aren t looking to the markets to hit their growth targets  They re investing in venture capital start up capital and other economically beneficial investments    Even the money that gets put into the NYSE helps drive up a company s share price which gives them purchasing power in the market place and helps prevent against hostile corporate takeovers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its the woman s body   absolutely But the child is half mine   and if you abort my child that I want you are killing my child   one that would have been welcome to the world
PoliticalDiscussion,For college yes  
PoliticalDiscussion,No one should be required to do something with their body if they don t want to If the mother and the father agree to a deal sign a contract then by all means she is required to carry the child If no deal is made however then a woman should be allowed to decide how she deals with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s really kind  Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would be that people who have attended college own more books than people who have not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the mother wants the child the farther is forced to care for it financially for  years This is just awful It s his finances  he decides  See what I did there You can t have your cake and eat it too You re taking the humanity out of the situation here It takes two people to conceive 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is a very meaningful difference between being surrounded by books growing up and having access to them if you re willing to go a couple miles 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not so much Liberals have had a shady history since before Santa Clara Libertarianism and anarchism got contranymized in the s and still mean what they actually mean pretty much everywhere else in the world 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt an all around coverage for an area regardless of whether or not everyone in the area pays for it  This is initiation of force A DRO or PDF acting on my behalf without my explicit consent os a violent third party vigilante  gt and will likely offer a payment plan  When I say  can t afford it  I don t mean  can t afford one lump payment  I mean the fact that having your rights secured costs direct money means it will outprice some people  gt They re person hood isn t in question  Absolutely is If no one s defending your rights you re an animal below a second class citizen You re fair game to anyone stronger than you alone  gt So then you re okay  I think you are muddling  My personal opinion with  I think I ve a right to take action in contrary to a third party decision  If a DRO comes down on a friend of mine or goes easy on a group I don t like I don t have to be OK with it but I have no right to take action against that decision That s vigilante justice which isn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,It certainly is and so is  libertarianism  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Anything you could do accidentally shouldn t be a crime in the first place  Remember saying this  
PoliticalDiscussion,What does that mean 
PoliticalDiscussion,The definition of free speech is different in Europe than it is in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who can contest them  Why 
PoliticalDiscussion,The man should be able to opt out of having any relationship with the child at a minimum and yes I think it is worth discussing whether the woman should be required to carry the child to term if the other parent wants to keep it  Two people created the potential life and those two people should both have a say in what happens with it  For the record I am pro choice as well  The idea of an abortion doesn t bother me in the least 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wish I could That one s  long gone though 
PoliticalDiscussion,Probably because they can t afford to do it themselves and they are much more likely to raise kids that are a net drain on society 
PoliticalDiscussion,Libraries already exist along with very very low cost used books    If the parents wanted to get books they could do so at little to no cost  Money isn t standing in the way for these parents 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alright lets make a deal You make the term liberal mean classical liberalism again and then I ll stop using the term libertarianism to describe my views 
PoliticalDiscussion,Poor people don t need books they need education Very different 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the dad wants the child the mother has to carry the child for  months and deliver it This is just awful It s the woman s body  she decides 
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually most powers start off more militaristic and authoritarian and people gain greater freedom over time as peace allows people to value freedom over security 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would be cost prohibitive and arguably useless 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt we are capable of determining what our culture finds obscene  No we re not Santorum thinks that some things are obscene that Larry Flynt finds completely acceptable That s the problem with censoring speech of any kind who gets to be on the censor board and determine what is allowed to be said and what isn t 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t mention government at all it s interesting that you read into the question that way 
PoliticalDiscussion,So now free entertainment should be provided by the government as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why only poor people 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt When every voter has a PC and an Internet connection more accurate national polls can be had  There is a hell of a lot more needed for accurate polling than a PC and an Internet connection for everyone you want to survey 
PoliticalDiscussion,Relevant Argumentrix    Governments should prohibit abortion  
PoliticalDiscussion,that s why libraries let you take the books home if you want to help kids be surrounded by books just help them use the tools already at hand 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that the parents should have the option of being involved   if mom doesnt want the kid but dad does she has the kid and the dad gets full custody   same for mom  when a parent wants to get involved they pay back child support 
PoliticalDiscussion,I just think it is a lost cause as far as criminals getting guns but sure some laws to keep them from getting guns are ok  I do not think that mental health evaluations should be a requirement for concealed carry permits 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re missing the point which is that all interactions among individuals should be voluntary This does not preclude voluntary payment for services rendered but coercive expropriation of rightfully owned property for the benefit of other individuals or groups 
PoliticalDiscussion,As long as the government extends only to your body i have no problem with someone volunteering to run their own body
PoliticalDiscussion,What about in the US though where there are laws to make it harder for criminals psychopaths crazy people to get guns but normal law abiding citizens can still legally purchase them Say for example there was a new law that added some other layer that made it more difficult for a convicted criminal to get a gun but a law abiding citizen would have no problem with it  because they re not a criminal  Do you think there would be an increase in gun crimes here even though it s not an outright ban  I will profess I m not very knowledgeable on actual gun ownership restrictions as it stands right now hence my attempt at doing some research 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You should look it up yourself so you can get better specifics and read it from an authoritative source besides someone on reddit   Already done and bookmarked   
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah no problem You should look it up yourself so you can get better specifics and read it from an authoritative source besides someone on reddit Basically that supreme court case was bullshit and should left on the ash heap of history I sorta like free speech if you haven t noticed 
PoliticalDiscussion, X rich white god fearing man who is standing up for other rich people which is good because although I m currently sinking in debit I have a massive poorly constructed house in a shitty neighborhood and several huge but hastily constructed televisions automobiles and watercraft That sorta makes me rich too so he s sorta standing up for me

PoliticalDiscussion,Do you honestly believe governments should be run by volunteers  
PoliticalDiscussion,Unless he was in the process of waging a jihad against the infidels that required he keep it secret  I think this is the most likely Think about it Bin Laden had to be taken care of because he was on the verge of turning rat and selling out his boss 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well lets start out with there was no fire and there was no theater There were some Yiddish socialist opposing the horrible WWI and they made pamphlets They opposed Woodrow Wilson and the war so they were brought to court for it for one of the anti speech laws that Woodrow Wilson had gotten passed The judge said that people didn t have the right to use speech that could cause danger He linked what the Yiddish were doing to yelling fire in a crowded theater with potential to cause harm to people This should of been covered in your American High School history class if you are American and if you took history in college covering America even more in depth look into it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a joke Lighten up I have no clue who wrote it or why so I am ignorant of this yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,correlation   causation   Simply having lots of books in your home when you grow doesn t mean you ll be successful But the types of parents who have lot of books  tend to be the types of parents who have other interests which are beneficial to their children  eg having an interest in the child s schooling   So air dropping a bunch of books isn t likely to do what you hope but finding a way to instill the particular interests in the parents which leads them to wanting to get a bunch of books will  but good luck on the latter  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yell fire in a crowded theatre  You of all people should never use that as a justification I m surprised you aren t disgusted by those words and the man that wrote them Really shows that either you are ignorant of what you are saying or you truly love the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m one of those who believes that the term  free speech is misguided if it  is referring to the First Amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yell fire in a crowded theatre 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I see what you re saying  Sorry for the mix up  And yes that is a problem  Checks and balances work to mitigate that although as we see that doesn t always work  There is no truly perfect system  
PoliticalDiscussion,sorry I might be a little slow but the al jazeera article doesn t mention  up to  soldiers involved in the killings  The preamble has  Almost all of them insisted that contrary to US military statements more than one soldier was involved in the massacre  but nothing like that appears in the transcript  Also FYI That CNN article says none of what you claim  Finally and remember this was the point you were originally contesting how does any of this make it a pr blunder for the whitehouse from where I sit and indeed from the articles you re citing it looks like the whitehouse is well out in front of the situation making amends with the victims and prosecuting the perpetrators of the crime s   
PoliticalDiscussion,Harder for them to get guns yes  Harder for them to commit crimes no  Crime in England is at an all time high  times higher than in the US  You can still buy a handgun in london despite them being banned for  years 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt OK But we agree that a PDF is under no moral obligation to provide any coverage  No they are not But it s the right thing to do and will likely offer a payment plan  which is good business or an all around coverage for an area regardless of whether or not everyone in the area pays for it  if it s what the customers want they ll pay for it regardless of how they feel about free riders    gt provide any coverage to those who can t pay and therefore those who can t pay are non persons  They re person hood isn t in question That has nothing to do with anything   gt It is if the bringer of the suit says it is  So then you re okay with what Shell did because the bringer of the suit settled 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is a very meaningful difference between being surrounded by books growing up and having access to them if you re willing to go a couple miles  Kids have a lot of free time and will absorb what s around them  I grew up surrounded by books and wish the same upbringing on all children 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gas   Oil  The US imports oil refines it then exports refined products like gas     gt How will adding more gas by drilling change this beyond increasing our export output  The price of gas is driven by the price of oil  In most cases out capacity for refining exceeds that for pumping oil   gt What is stopping oil companies to decide to continue sending the gas to highest bidder and leave domestic prices high  Um they do ship to the highest bidder  That s how markets work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the govt is the highest power and it is made up of people which you yourself admit are unscrupulous more often than not So the apparent good they do should pale in comparison to the bad

PoliticalDiscussion,Death penalties are irreversible Lawrence O Donnell summed it up the best The true test to your opposition for the death penalty is in the hard solid cases The only way to eliminate wrongful death penalties is to eliminate all death penalties If you oppose the death penalty for  doubtful cases but support it for solid cases then there will always be  doubtful cases   Lawrence O Donnell on the death penalty  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we ought to make it a right  Just like any other outreach program  When every voter has a PC and an Internet connection more accurate national polls can be had 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your question made no sense  Could you please rephrase it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Gladly  Though judging by the voting here the idea is failing to capture the popular imagination 
PoliticalDiscussion,True but those categories are a little suspect  There are lots of large leftwing groups that certainly identify with environmental causes but are not specifically environmental groups as well as companies like GE that donate specifically for environmental issues  It s more complicated than oil industry vs Greenpeace 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My only reason for bring it up and note I didn t claim it was corrupting as you did was to show a reason why the Republican party would oppose climate change regardless of Al Gore Although I didn t originally mention this their favoring of the GoP extends back long before    As does environmental groups favoring democrats  My point is that both side had long established donor groups which pre existing commitments to be for or against climate legislation   gt wouldn t those donations only go to reinforce the democrats already widely held acceptance  Absolutely just like oil industry groups reinforced republicans preexisting dislike of regulation environmental groups etc    gt So unless you could show it generated noticeable negativity among Republicans and Independents then the point of mentioning it is moot  Sorry if I wasn t clear  My point was that the issue rose in salience among certain groups in the early s particularly among those who were already interested in environmental issue which most republican voters are not  When they started to press on the issue with legislation like Kyoto that is when non environmentalists became aware and began to push back    gt I believe it can be claimed that Gore increased topic saliency through  An Inconvenient Truth  but this would suggest he was more of a cause than a symptom in the eyes of the American public  The question is had gore released his video  years earlier would it have accomplished as much  Obviously not a question you can answer easily but I suspect not  If that is the case then it is likier he was riding a wave rather can causing one   gt I m not going to argue whether Gore was trying to exploit popular sentiment for financial gain or not without evidence I don t feel the data shown in the Gallup polls support the idea he was riding a wave of pro environmental zeitgeist rather he s always been a nut for environmentalism   I have no doubt that gore is sincere though he does a lot of flying around on private jets for someone so worried about carbon  That said it is very very easy for people to confuse their own self interest with the general  As has been said it is very difficult to get a man to understand something when his paycheck depends on him not understanding it  Also I don t think he was riding a pro environmental zeitgeist rather I think he was riding a pro addressing climate change zeitgeist within the broader pro environmental movement 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but the oil industry gives a lot more money to candidates than environmental groups  According to open secrets org the oil industry spent  M on lobbying last year compared to  M from environmental advocates 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can t they make it harder for them though 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Well obviously taxes aren t individual usage fees But the questions  and I apologize profusely again for not being able to find the link were specifically asking if the individual being polled was willing to pay more in taxes if it meant saving or implementing various programs And more people than you might think would say yes  obviously varying percentages of people said  yes depending on the popularity of the program   Well the current problem is that we have government programs that people like but no one is paying for them  The rich aren t paying for them  The middle class isn t paying for them  The poor aren t paying for them  No one is paying for them    If taxes are only raised on people with k salaries the programs will not be paid for  So the  only way to pay for the programs we currently have  without adding new ones is to raise taxes on the middle class    You say that there is a link to survey in which middle class people say that they would be willing to pay more in taxes if their money went to programs that they approve of and I do trust you that a link to this poll does exist but currently there are programs that the middle class approves of  in polls they say that they are in favor of funding Social Securit Medicare Medicaid The US Military etc  whose payment is only possible with a tax raise applied to the middle class that they disapprove of  There is a difference between what people say they are willing to contribute and what they are actually willing to   gt Spending cuts too Plus the economic recovery will result in growing revenues  The spending cuts that the middle class is typically in favor of are too small to reasonably shrink the debt  Unless an axe is taken to medicare social security  the Ryan plan takes an axe to Medicare  spending cuts alone will not balance the budget  You can t have your cake and eat it too unless you eat your kids which is what running trillion dollar deficits is the equivalent of doing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why do you not cite their influence as as corrupting as energy companies donating to the right  Mainly because it s relevancy to the question was Al Gore a positive influence on the issue of climate change the association to pro environmental groups political donations is very weak unless you have supporting evidence and not speculation that it influenced the opinions of those who view themselves as independent or republican on the issue of climate change  My only reason for bring it up and note I didn t claim it was corrupting as you did was to show a reason why the Republican party would oppose climate change regardless of Al Gore  Although I didn t originally mention this  their favoring of the GoP extends back long before     This only goes to debunk the idea that Al Gore significantly galvanized the Republican party against climate change versus the view that it was always against climate change  I don t think it s necessary to argue that Democrats have traditionally supported the theory of anthropogenic climate change that should be pretty self evident  Also although you provide no supporting evidence I won t argue that companies seeking to benefit from climate change reforms have primarily donated to Democrats  However wouldn t those donations only go to reinforce the democrats already widely held acceptance  So unless you could show it generated noticeable negativity among Republicans and Independents then the point of mentioning it is moot  As for your mentioning of topic saliency lets look at some data   In  Gallup released polling data on the issue that extended back more than a decade     The data show   that after  people thought global warming was generally more exaggerated but the sharpest incline corresponds to the recession in    people believing global warming will occur within our lifetime has also decreased since  but it did peak around    more people did see global warming as a threat within their lifetime after  but this trend completely reversed itself after   Points  and  indicate that his documentary had a modest impact on people accepting climate change but that the US Recession in  undid that impact and more supporting my idea that the economy has played a significant role in people s opinions  But little towards the saliency of climate change that you suggest is shown in the data if I understand what you said correctly  Opinion was shown to be mostly flat until  where I believe it can be claimed that Gore increased topic saliency through  An Inconvenient Truth  but this would suggest he was more of a cause than a symptom in the eyes of the American public  The data post show that the distraction of the economic recession reduced the saliency of climate change but again this would be the effect of Gore either positively or negatively  I m not going to argue whether Gore was trying to exploit popular sentiment for financial gain or not without evidence  I don t feel the data shown in the Gallup polls support the idea he was riding a wave of pro environmental zeitgeist rather he s always been a nut for environmentalism  But he may have made the documentary at least in part to profit from it  I just have no evidence of that personally so it s not a claim I able to support

PoliticalDiscussion, gt some people argue that the FBI should disclose how many terror plots come close to succeeding  Actually the FBI seem to have to trump up some of the plots they do foil indeed some of these come close to entrapments inspired by the FBI seemingly to show they re doing their job on that front  See if this UK Guardian article doesn t reek of instigation and entrapment     That leads me to suppose that the FBI and other alphabet agencies are not really keeping much back about near success terror plots Maybe they just want us to  think they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you are a child who lashes out at others and calls people names and makes accusations without provocation You undermine your own arguments with your poor attitude

PoliticalDiscussion,Under the constitution  Senators were sent to congress by the state   how they were selected was up to the individual state  But the Senators were supposed to represent the individual states interest     Congressmen represented the people of the state Senators represented the state  Any law that was passed had to be approved by the representatives of the people and of the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,Jesus that s one giant circlejerk OP     But to answer the question  not that you want an answer or give a shit  the environmentalist movement came about long before Gore became a prominent figure within it and it was politicized on BOTH sides of the table long before him as well

PoliticalDiscussion, gt but if you tie tax cuts to program cuts they start saying  no very very quickly and in fact tend to swing the other way  If they want the program I don t doubt what you say I m just saying that your choice of words and subject was deceiving People don t want higher taxes in the general but only in the specific that it helps the person or they like it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve heard that figure dozens of times but a simple google search will do the trick     Hope that will suffice 
PoliticalDiscussion,Environmental groups overwhelmingly donate to the left and tend to oppose any proposals put out to do anything like the current debacle over the Keystone pipeline  Why do you not cite their influence as as corrupting as energy companies donating to the right  Second I think the word you are looking for is salience or how visible the issue is  In the s climate change was a much less salient issue which means that opposition to it was a lot more muted  Since then the environmental movement has pushed it to the absolute forefront of their efforts so it is not a surprise to see that the intensity of resistance has increased  Gore I think is more of a symptom of this shift than a cause  Gore was grabbing the coattails as history galloped past so to speak  The biggest change his advocacy has had I think is making himself quite a bit of money and fame  Had he not been there the trajectory of the issue would have been much the same 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a fiction that  every man is an island  Especially in America where outcomes are more strongly tied to your father s income than most anywhere else in the developed world  Successful wealthy people benefit  tremendously from government government trains their workforce to a certain minimum level provides roads security enforces intellectual property rights copyright etc etc Hell our campaign finance system is so corrupt that wealthy people can practically just purchase the government policy they find most beneficial  including low tax rates shifting the burden of paying for all of these services they benefit from down to the working class

PoliticalDiscussion,Like I said I can t find the link again  and I apologize for that  but it was NOT about usage fees it was about tax rates If you ask generic  do you want lower taxes   of course people say yes in large percentages but if you tie tax cuts to program cuts they start saying  no very very quickly and in fact tend to swing the other way

PoliticalDiscussion, gt When business lays off workers for profits or funnels profits to executives instead of payrolls less people in the aggregate can afford products these businesses can produce   In a nut shell this is the trickle down theory That those executives will eventually amass enough money that they will want to spend it and will have to employ other people   gt What incentives or laws can be created to prevent this  There are several thoughts on the subject I prefer the  Japanese Keiretsu   banking business system   Japanese banks Mitsubishi   Mitsubishi Motors  Mitsui   Fuji Photo Film Sony  Sumitomo   Mazda  Fuyo   Canon Hitachi  Dai Ichi Kangyo   Isuzu Kawasaki Heavy Industries  Sanwa   Hitachi Sharp Corporation  Tokai  Toyota Group   Suzuki Motor Toyota  and ect Are organized closer to GE than a solitary banking institution   This means the profits of one sector is weighed against the damage to another when considering downsizing and or outsourcing manufacturing This system isn t perfect and should be looked at with strict scrutiny However even during Japan s Lost Decade the Japanese life expectancy rose incomes rose and quality of life increased   citation

PoliticalDiscussion,The only way you re going to get a substantial discussion subreddit going is if you screen and approve contributors ahead of time  I unscubscribed from this subreddit when I was resigned that it has become a dumping ground for people who are frustrated by how overwhelmingly left leaning r politics is  The moderators should each select  or so substantial contributors and keep adding more on based upon their body of work  Not hard to do all you have to do is click on the username  This would help screenout throwaway sock puppet accounts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Businesses have to be profitable If they are starting to fail they may layoff large numbers of employees to restructure It s a necessary part of our economy If the government tries to prevent people from being fired then companies will be very hesitant to hire anyone Everyone will transition to part time and contract work   like in Spain It creates a two tiered workforce and discourages young employees in order to provide additional protections for older or more well connected employees  Every company is different but they are all trying to provide a product or service while making a profit Their purpose isn t to hire employees or stimulate the larger economy with their payroll   that s just a side effect of their larger goal They need employees to make a product and those employees demand a salary for their efforts  They each serve different products and services Not all businesses are reliant on middle class workers Businesses operate internationally they cater to other companies  selling increased efficiency in some form  wealthy consumers  designer goods  large institutions  medical equipment eco friendly building technology or government projects  planes communication equipment  The well being and earnings of the middle class is not always relevant to their bottom line   Even if a company is reliant on the well being of middle class earnings their primary objective is to make a superior product They respond to the needs of their customers  If ordinary Americans are choosing cheaper brands because of the recession then Proctor and Gamble finds a way to make cheaper products      The increasing salaries of executives is the result of a number of factors Part of it is supply and demand part of it is the way their contracts are written and part of it is the fact that their boards have long standing relationships with them that ultimately effects their compensation They demand higher salaries and they get it because the companies can t find any qualified candidates for a lower salary   Ordinary employees and factory workers are more expendable They re easier to replace and there are people out there with similar qualifications willing to work for less   Nothing s perfect There are cases where failing companies paid out unfair executive compensation or paid off investors at the expense of ordinary employees There are also examples where successful executives are able to turn a floundering company into successful one to the benefit of everyone involved including its employees    Investor payout after company failure     We could institute additional banking regulations to prevent investors from using company loans to payoff investors I m not too familiar with private equity so I can t really say why this sort of thing is allowed to happen I suppose it probably increases investment but it also comes with a lot of risk to individual companies   Executive bonus payout in the midst of the bailout housing collaose     The government could have made executive compensation an issue but then the healthier banks might have refused to take the bailout money At the end of the day they were trying to stabilize the banks and protect our larger economy The status of our Banking industry is a larger question that I m not really informed enough to answer but the payout of bonuses during the collapse was both disgusting and understandable 
PoliticalDiscussion,What monopolies Only baneful monopolies I ve ever seen have been government created 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re still talking about a privilege just protected more thoroughly Anything granted by law can be taken away by law however This is why the Bill of Rights doesn t  grant rights but rather acknowledge them and  attempt to prevent the Congress from using legislation to remove them  I live in Amish country where a lot of people don t even have electricity Are they exempt just as they are from many other government programs Do some people get refurbished machines while others get new ones That hardly seems fair Shouldn t everyone get the same exact one To fund this are we raising taxes cutting spending printing borrowing or some combination of the three What if poor people sell their computer for money to spend on other needed things like food and clothing etc  or on  wasteful things like candy and video games  Have they ceded their right to be included in the poll Do we need to give them another one   gt One may not be allotted enough time in a public venue to read lengthy scientific journal articles as an example  Print it out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps you are technically correct regarding my use of the term  right    Privilege  however connotes the possibility of a capricious or strategic removal of the granted  I would the proposed reality reflect a situation wherein such capricious or strategic removal of the technology would be forbidden  This makes it very much like a right if not technically so  I am not familiar enough with the technology to answer your question  Perhaps refurbished PCs might make up a large part of it  I do think getting them into the homes is rather pertinent  One may not be allotted enough time in a public venue to read lengthy scientific journal articles as an example  Also around the clock continuous instantaneous polling of the greater population can only be facilitated by having PCs in every home

PoliticalDiscussion, gt How else has CEO pay gone from  to  over the course of  yrs but worker  bee pay has not kept up        Globalization has increased risk reward payoffs for strategic decisions in multi national companies at the same time that Americans are being forced to compete with equally capable and equally deserving foreigners  The period of American Exceptionalism is ending and rather focus on improving their skills and abilities as workers many people would rather try to use force in order to increase their own Entitlements  Education scores haven t risen and out of wedlock births have sharply increased  Military spending is also sapping a lot of the capital that could have gone into increasing general welfare as well          Pigheaded reactionary legislation is usually never the way to go  It s usually best to investigate the root cause of issues and try to remove as many barriers that have been erected as possible rather than to erect new ones

PoliticalDiscussion,The premise is wrong A firm will hire or fire the people who drives the most value for it There s no reason  the firm would want to hire people that return negative value for it or have a lower ROI for it  An executive can make or break a company on his her own That s why companies set aside so much money to hire the best of the best As much as people love to hate on CEOs getting paid a lot you have to realize that its the board of directors playing the lottery in terms of management and hoping they return James Skinner  McDonald s CEO vs Carol Bartz  Yahoo CEO  ON the flip side laying off  warehouse workers in a distribution center that is no longer running at full capacity can save the company a lot of money which can then be used to attract top management 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not what I said I said  personal or inflammatory attacks  or in other words comments that don t address the topic but attack the poster personally like calling someone an  idiot racist teabagger  for example That kind of comment does nothing to add to the dialogue and only promotes hostility  There is certainly a difference however in having an offensive yet substantive opinion and attacking someone with petty name calling and other  flamebait remarks 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes as long as the majority of the people still live relatively comfortable lives you will not see a revolt  An American revolution would be such a clusterfuck anyway  What would you replace it with  A quarter of the country thinks there s too much government another quarter thinks there s not enough government and then the rest are just trying to live there lives and don t want to get involved  
PoliticalDiscussion,The free market will  regulate it as such  One of two things will happen when the layoffs occur The quality of the product will decline or it will not  If the layoffs do not cause the quality of the product to decline then you didn t need those workers in the first place they truly were overhead that was costing the company money In a competitive free market all it would take is one company to decide to use those cost savings to lower their prices and now all of a sudden every company has to use those cost savings to lower their price or else they will lose customers to the ones that cut prices Your assumption that the profits from efficiency gains are always  funneled to the top is not sound The free market will force the company to eventually use those cost savings from increased efficiency to get more customers  i e reduce prices   If those layoffs do cause the product quality to deteriorate then the company will lose customers to competing companies that did not do the same thing and the free market will  regulate them out of existence  Your assumption that layoffs cause less people in the aggregate to afford products is also not sound In a free market that is functioning correctly  i e not one where unemployment is subsidized and encouraged  historically as the rate of unemployment increased so did the collective innovation of the country When people are forced to come up with innovative ways of making money innovations are born which produces jobs and reduces unemployment

PoliticalDiscussion,Can you link to the law stating that it requires an actual relationship   It was my understanding that the non primary parent pays regardless of their relationship status    gt  Somebody is going to pay child support  There is really no way of getting out of it  If you are the  nonprimary then you will financially support your child and provide health insurance in almost all cases Yes this includes those circumstances where the child was produced as a result of a  one night stand   Doesn t matter how long  the relationship was or the commitment of that relationship a child was produced and support will be paid   
PoliticalDiscussion,Did your children s mother have an easy pregnancy  Because having seen my fianc struggle with a wanted pregnancy I can t imagine the horror of carrying an unwanted child to term   Does the man get to change his mind    If a woman wants to get an abortion at  weeks and the man says no can he change his mind at  weeks and just leave    What happens to the baby then  What happens to the mother who had her choice to end the pregnancy taken from her    Does she have to stop smoking or drinking  Does the man become responsible for her bills when she can t work  Her hospital bills when she needs a c section  Is the man required to attend all of the doctors appointments  Does the man need to reimburse the women for lost wages due to doctors appointments  
PoliticalDiscussion,What about a Constitutional breaking point  Let s say there is a controversial issue that SCOTUS rules on and the Executive Branch ignores   would that also be a legitimate grievance  
PoliticalDiscussion,I see where you are going with this   neither parent is invested in a relationship   hmm Generally both parties would want the abortion and should pay equally But barring belief in life the option for the male to keep the child he would also then have to pay for loss of work and give compensation for loss of standard of living and of course pay for her medical bills etc
PoliticalDiscussion,What of further increases in inflation and fuel prices  It appears that folks are feeling a lot of pressure from the rising price of food fuel  both of which are linked and is contributing negatively to their ability to manage their personal finances  Couple that with stagnant wages   I mean that alone won t do it but it will definitely foster some anger in the general population

PoliticalDiscussion,Libraries are great public goods and they do give people access to information but they don t do anything to address poverty I think the OP s idea is trying to do something to address the difference in child development between poor families and middle class families   gt By age four the average child in a professional family hears about  million more words than the average child in a working class family and about  million more words than children in low income families   Lower income families are left out of the loop They don t learn all the child development techniques they are less likely to read to their kids and more likely to use corporal punishment for discipline It s a cultural difference that needs to be addressed   OP s plan is not going to work either Merely giving them books doesn t change anything  Programs like the Harlem Children s Zone are better ways to address these problems They are developing classes and programs to make people better parents    There s no perfect solution but we should be making investments and experimenting to see what works 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its not my definition of poverty They have an actual number for that you know It s already a thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sanctuary districts 
PoliticalDiscussion,There s always Little Ceasar s and Cici s 
PoliticalDiscussion,When in the course of human events my friend 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m male   and I have two kids
PoliticalDiscussion,I m pretty sure any attempt to overthrow a state government would result in immediate involvement of the federal government   
PoliticalDiscussion,My library doesn t even fine for overdue children s materials They offer programming in early literacy storytimes and they even did a life sized Candyland game with prizes  candy pencils etc and juice or hot chocolate at the end to get kids to come to the library I used to live in my local libraries as a kid and teen and love being a part of a system as an adult I also was surrounded by books as a kid from my mom having things like Steven King lying around to my Dad who had walls of fantasy and sci fi hardbounds  That being said kids who read usually have parents who read For every kid that takes home a stack of books  whose parents usually also have books there s two or three families taking out nothing but like  DVDs And this is FINE Everyone deserves to be entertained be it through books or movies or music and the library gives even the poorest families  as well as more wealthy but frugal a chance to both enlighten as well as entertain themselves The point is that having books around and reading a lot seems to be more of a cultural thing than a wealth thing Given the amount of materials available be it books magazines DVDs Bluerays Audiobooks and even comics and graphic novels you tend to see kids taking out the same materials as their parents If a kid sees their mom and dad reading a lot and their parents buy them books and take them to the library chances are you re going to have a kid that reads If mom and dad are watching American Idol and reruns of Lost and Cheers and never pick up a book in most cases you re going to see their children are not big readers Kids emulate their parents especially when the re very young  On top of that there are other cultural issues which may greatly affect older kids I ve heard about kids being harassed and even threatened for going to homework help or being insulted for reading This is especially true among our  thug crowd many of whom consider education and reading to be weak or a waste of time In these cases someone who enjoys reading is faced with becoming a social pariah or even being bullied merely because they re seen by their peers while reading a book This kind of peer pressure is worse than pushing drugs to me  My point I guess is that literacy and reading is more about parents and culture than wealth Unless you can get parents who read with their children at a young age take them regularly to the library if they can t or don t want to buy books make them understand that their friends and classmates are wrong if they mock them and perhaps read around them you aren t likely to have a kid who grows up to become an avid reader There s exceptions of course  I have a friend who grew up rather well off and whose patents are educated and successful and who worked for quite a while at a bookstore yet I don t think he s read more than  books in the last  years I m sure he was surrounded by books as a kid he just doesn t like reading    TL DR I think that kids grow up to become readers if they re surrounded by around other  readers  not just books   
PoliticalDiscussion,Even during the Revolution they pulled it off with  of the population actively involved   If numbers were comparable today that would be  million people actively involved but spread throughout the entire nation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah basically 
PoliticalDiscussion,Armed revolt is simply not going to happen  It was able to happen in  because the weapons the army had weren t that different from what individuals owned  Now the military has drones cruise missiles bombers etc that almost any civilian could never hope to own  People know this and therefore rightly believe that an armed revolution against the US government would never work therefore they won t do it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Look either everything is funny or nothing is funny   What   gt Why are we so worried  Nobosy is worried about anything We are laughing at the hypocrisy from the left   gt I feel like we Americans actively looked for things to be offended by so we can wax moralistic and let everyone else know why we re more informed and caring than everyone else  Black face skits go over well in your country 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are no near term scenarios for armed revolution in the US    Long term  I don t know  Maybe people could be pushed to armed revolution as a result of a long painful economic depression  
PoliticalDiscussion,The  BYPRODUCT you speak of was the only product of his actions that night   unless you count the  dead civilians  of whom were children  Any man or woman in uniform should back my call if not for themselves then for their uniform and their country 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would feel opposed to it Let charities handle it Why is government  i e other people s money always the answer 
PoliticalDiscussion,You ve never been pregnant or lived closely with a women who was pregnant have you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say the fetus is the mother s body until it exits her body
PoliticalDiscussion,So basically no revolutions as long as American Idol is on time and you can get Domino s Pizza cheap and quickly 
PoliticalDiscussion,The breaking point is the same anywhere  The only way to get the full populous to revolt is to either manipulate them into doing so or to keep them from providing the absolute basics for them and theirs  Either way the populous needs to feel there s no other choice    Sorry to break that to most of the revolution zombie apocalypse seekers but we re a long ways away from that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Lulz I have personally been behind food stamp recipients spending their food stamp money  on their little epay card thing on nothing but candy and soda I m not saying that all recipients do this only that it is possible and does indeed happen   People will make their own decisions based on what is given them rather than follow a prescribed allocation If they wanted books and valued them above other things they would buy them and use them if they did not they would not You cannot force behavior with policy Alcohol prohibition and the current drug war are the best examples 
PoliticalDiscussion, A PC in every bedroom and a router in every house  
PoliticalDiscussion,  for drug money Fucking Liberal fascist socialist minorities 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you really unaware of the fact that virtually every public school in this country has a library  Poor children have plenty of disadvantages but access to books is not one of them 
PoliticalDiscussion,To me it  isn t a question of what it is called   a fetus a baby a group of cells   in nine months it is still a child    but the joy of living isn t what something is right now if it on a directed path   you cant stop a pregnancy mid step and say I want a bird   what is in a woman is only ever going to turn into a child or not become anything   and the issue with me isn t killing a fill in the blank it is want it   it is choice when a woman says it is my body it is my choice it comes off as fuck you to the male   if both parents dont want the kid the kill it A unwanted child can become loved by the parents but it won t be raised like a child that was being wanted   the child doesn t have a choice in the matter because it doesn t know yet it can only feel   
PoliticalDiscussion,Since you have nothing to add I guess I ll just keep going Do you know how libraries work You can take multiple books out for an extended period of time and there are multiple extensions you can get  I m not going to pretend that this is widely practiced and there are many families who don t know about this or don t do it Which is why instead of setting up more wasteful government agencies you pay someone who already works for the library a little bit more to help kids and families use the tools already at hand Knowledge is great but there is a reason the culture has shifted away from it and the only reason you are going to shift it back is through PR not some bogus idea of a government agency 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not believe life begins at conception and therefore do not believe a woman would be  killing a child  You seem to believe that a woman has fewer rights than a collection of cells and I don t understand how a person could hold that view I can t think like that It takes a big toll on the woman to do such a thing and a woman should have support through those times She should not be fearful of the law or being looked down upon by others   I do understand how a person would feel if he or she truly believed that a woman kills a child when going through with an abortion Unfortunately what constitues a person is not clear to everyone which makes defining abortion difficult 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because you do not end something by making it special You end something by making it not significant 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dolly Parton has a charity called  Imagination Library   that gives registered children a free book once a month every month until they are  I love this program because it is not directed just to low income families and the kids get fresh books in the mail 
PoliticalDiscussion,A risk yes   but not one that is impossible to overcome with science as it is   and if it becomes an issue of the safety of the woman the child dies and the woman lives   
PoliticalDiscussion,  DISCUSSION  All I hear on fox news and republican radio is HOW could Obama say this he is bringing race into the story    Blah blah If the president made a comment how is it NOT political I am raising a point some might have missed Why don t you comment on topic instead of waving your hand   Sounds like sour grapes to me
PoliticalDiscussion,I d say a little of both I never had books in my household but my mom always encouraged bringing home books from school and reading them I never did bring them home though I m still not a book reader Obviously this might be a minority situation I just thought this when I read your comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,That absolutely never happens The pattern is always tyranny to the point of revolution followed by a few generations of valuing freedom and then tyranny creeps back in usually in a crisis 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep in mind that pregnancy is a risky proposition  An early term abortion is much safer for the woman than carrying a pregnancy to term  Birth comes with risks of tearing incontinence bigger complications or even death  The mother shouldn t be forced to undergo this risk of death against her will 
PoliticalDiscussion,OR WAIT what if we give books to food pantries so they can give them away to families along with the food They re already going there right I m sure no one would turn down some free children s books  
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t think like that   I m sorry I cant use that line of thinking where telling the person that was supposed to be the person that I cared the most where you would be killing my child   I would smile as the woman left my life regardless if she was perfect for me or not   this is getting upsetting reading poster board phrases that have become a class of meme used to marginalized everything about males   I hate feeling old at 
PoliticalDiscussion,r politicaldiscussion   Political  discussion      DISCUSSION  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes yes women do get special consideration Women should not be required to carry a child because a man thinks she should Ever Going through pregnancy is completely different than amputating a limb A man has no right to tell a woman that she has to suffer through an unwanted pregnancy regardless if it is half his DNA or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it doesn t change my opinion of the case Zimmerman used excessive force to defend himself no matter Martin s actions and under the majority of courts would be tried under excessive bodily harm if not manslaughter 
PoliticalDiscussion,However this is only true in the US and to an extent the UK Most of Europe s tuition fee s total about    per year plus living expenses even some of the top universities in Europe are like this Paris Berlin and Amsterdam  The amount that some American Universities charge is ridiculously overpriced with America not even having the top universities in the world   The United Kingdom holds  out of  of the Top Universities in the world also holding the top spot over Harvard  They have this without gross overfunding and caps on tuition so no funding does not equal a great university Tuition shouldn t be free I m not saying that but don t take tuition fees meaning a better education it certainly doesn t  EDIT Even the United Kingdom has only had fees up to      until this year a  th of what Harvard charge and half of what Stanford charges 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s regressive and primarily benefits the rich who can get around  on the dollar for their tax writeoff while the poor get fuck all back and basically have to pay for the insurance in full with no subsidy  In essence the government would be paying huge amounts of money to insure the rich while providing hardly anything to the poor 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you had even bothered to google college costs you would see why that s not possible   For one college professors are highly educated members of society They salary for professors alone would eat up most if not all of the funding that the government gives to universities 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sure but I don t think the left was really attacking Romney for the etch a sketch comment If anything the left should be pleased because it indicates Romney isn t actually a far right candidate like he s making himself out to be Rather he seems like Mass governor Romney  Really It seemed to me that it was the newest meme   gt and what Obama said isn t really shocking in any way  HAHAHahahahahaha   Oh man Thanks   gt It s called diplomacy   Oh You weren t kidding me That is kind of sad I prefer the kind of diplomacy that doesn t hinge on re election   and I also prefer diplomacy from a presidential candidate that is the same  before the election as it is  after the election Call me crazy but I m into the whole continuity and honesty thing   gt It s called diplomacy   I d call it begging before I call it diplomacy   gt Santorum and Gingrich are just becoming desperate at this point  Couldn t agree with you more on that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you  Do you think i have a chance at becoming Mit Romney s running mate 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are right Gingrich and Santorum made those attacks That doesn t mean the left isn t making the same attack             And I really like the way you avoided the question entirely   
PoliticalDiscussion,If Bush could ve overthrown Saddam with not only the support of the Iraqi people but also all of NATO and done it with minimal loss of US life and minimal loss of Iraqi life at the hands of the allies AND done it without occupation AND done it without allowing American companies to come in and take over Iraq s economy    then he d be a god damn hero to everyone including most Iraqis   Edit AND if he did it while stating  Our goal is to remove a brutal dictator rather than lying about a potential threat to the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,dude after  solid years of terrible war and every day having to turn on the TV to see the cluster fuck   to hear Bush say  Bring Em On taunting our enemy to fucking attack our troops    The country is beyond tired of this shit and protesting The largest protests in the world were to stop the invasion People are burnt out   Also Libya is not something Obama asked for like Bush and Cheney did for Iraq We only responded to situation not caused by the president s desire in doing so kept our involvement to a minimum No troops killed and a tiny fraction of money compared to Iraq But I guess that is a failure to you  Remember Cheney and his company directly benefited from Iraq with over  billion  Bush had many investments in defense contractors and also made a killing directly from his policies Cheney was payed by Halliburton during his years as VP for  previously rendered services BS  Imagine Obama getting a pay check from Solyndra as he pens laws helping them  France and UK benefited from Libya not any of Obama s direct investments    Bush lost  million jobs a ton of debt in the trillions  and over  thousand troops he deserves scorn and nothing else   Now Iraq is siding with fucking Iran   great work George 
PoliticalDiscussion,Whoa take a deep breath I had assumed you meant the political definition of the word campaign as in Bush ran for election on the platform of invading Iraq 
PoliticalDiscussion,Dude being pro life is fine Just don t expect everyone to fall in line and believe the same thing There are certain realities that exist in life and having a myopic view doesn t translate well when confronted with those realities Remember an abortion is nothing more than a medical procedure It s made into something more with faith and the abstract concept of life Life is this indeterminate concept that I don t think people have thought thoroughly enough about yet advocate for how much they want to protect it   Getting back to the topic at hand if abortion is nothing more than a medical procedure should other people be able to decide whether or not you are allowed to have said medical procedure   Let s go with analogies   A married man and woman have been together for a while The woman wants another child but the man doesn t and he wants a vasectomy so he can have sex without worrying about an unwanted pregnancy Does the woman have a right to say that the man isn t allowed to get the vasectomy    Let s flip it around Same married couple This time the man wants another child but the woman doesn t Does the man have a right to impregnate her Does the woman have a right to tell him to get a vasectomy  They may be married but their bodies are their own No one can force you to do anything against your will If the law did allow for married partners  or a partner in any form of relationship to dictate what the other can and cannot do with their body this inevitably leads to serious issues 
PoliticalDiscussion,The states have the right to  police power meaning that they are able to use whatever means necesarry to protect their citizens  In this case protecting the health of the citizens  At the state level the elected officials are much closer to their constiuents and theoretically more likely to listen to their wishes  If you don t like how a state is running things you could leave to another statewhere things are run the way you would like it to  Of course it is not that easy to move but that is the theory anyway 
PoliticalDiscussion,are you on the same planet They campaigned  The whole admin for over a year Fox news was   we must invade anyone otherwise was a traitor Freedom fries and cries for Dead Dixie chicks is what I remember  Mushroom cloud ring a bell speech after speech up to the state of the union and those  words    Full court press every admin associate was on talk show after talk show  we know where the weapons are  as Rumsfeld points to a map of northern Iraq   Please it is one thing to support this shit but another all together to rewrite fucking history  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just asking what people would say about Bush supporting rebels and using American force to overthrow a middle east leader 
PoliticalDiscussion,does playing gotcha do anything for those of us who aren t millionaires  whether it be magic panties or santorum cleaners or uncle tom we are all still being taken down from the inside  
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve seen numbers that say productivity continues to rise in spite of high unemployment  I used bar soap for example  What are my options  I can try a multitude of other soaps   or   owned by  different companies     My feeling is there is collusion in the marketplace  My grandfather did this years ago  He ran a business that really only had one competitor He would give his competitor a heads up and vice versa on product offerings and prices  It was more profitable to collude than to compete  It seems the time of taking my dollars elsewhere is over  So I don t go to Dish network  they ll fail and be bought by Direct TV  So now I have the option of Comcast and Direct TV  It s just better for them to collude and swap customers than compete    Just like a fixed boxing match  
PoliticalDiscussion,While this may be true I feel that generations of middle class existence here in the US depend precariously on an increasingly complex system which provides goods and entertainment   Middle Class folks in a rd world country may riot when they run out of bread and rice but the US would fall apart if folks couldn t buy ice cream or hot dogs  If Americans had to face a fraction of the scarcity seen elsewhere in the world then people would toss cars over and burn them  Then again they riot after the Red Sox  win too   
PoliticalDiscussion,I would think that unstable unreliable productivity would be more damaging than replacing workers causing the instability Perhaps I m not understanding your argument   could you clarify a little 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I remember correctly the exchanges only apply to individual states  Multi state exchanges may be possible but it s certainly not a  national one that was originally proposed 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Right now it s a penalty for not using a  service  when it should ve been a tax write off to get health insurance I E No health insurance when you file taxes Less refund for you  That s   actually a really really good idea why is this not how its done 
PoliticalDiscussion,This concept does not escape me  But doesn t it cause damage to lay off workers use the threat of termination to stabilize productivity to only then take the added profit and distribute it among the executives 
PoliticalDiscussion,Companies perform a cost benefit analysis and hire workers to optimize profits There are a few principles here     Labor with regards to capital has  diminishing marginal returns    With the same amount of computers workstations machinery etc  each additional worker adds less revenue to the company than the previous one     The marginal cost of an additional worker is constant   Each worker doing the same job with the same education and same experience is paid the same amount  This and only this determines how many workers a firm hires Firms will hire until      Marginal revenue from an additional worker  lt Marginal cost of hiring that worker  You can increase the number of workers by increasing their productivity and thus marginal revenue by adding more capital  additional workstations eg or by decreasing their marginal cost  wages  If no change is made to either marginal cost or marginal revenue firing workers will  lose profit for the company  From an aggregate perspective  you want to let this happen It produces the most efficient use of labor It lets prices reach their market clearing price without distortions meaning there is no shortage of workers or product  Attempts to change this will never help the aggregate What you will end up doing is help the few people who own and work at the company at the expense of the population in general at  best  At worst you will drive firms out of the market and hurt both workers and the general population 
PoliticalDiscussion,What s the issue with Libya 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush never campaigned for invading Iraq
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry but i thought it was Gingrich and Santorum who were out in front on the whole  Etch A Sketch thing  Did you miss something 
PoliticalDiscussion,See this is a line for me  If a woman intends to have a baby  it s a baby  I define intend by not aborting  If a pregnant woman is killed  is that two lives that were taken  What of the case were a woman got out of a carpool lane ticket because she was pregnant  I know not a big whoop but she got out of it none the less  Shouldn t there be any prevention for someone who is causing detriment to a developing life  In the Rape of Nanking Chinese women had fetuses torn from their belly by Japanese soldiers   doesn t that create a specific conditional horror or is this just the murder of a woman 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My answer is it s politics as usual The other side did it therefore it s bad to republicans  But if that s politics as usual why didn t the Democrats say  The Republicans proposed it therefore it s bad  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The government is notorious for making bad purchasing decisions and spending more money than is required to buy things The only reason buying in bulk is cheaper for companies is that they can negotiate the bulk prices When government agencies buy things they rarely negotiate prices  in fact they are actually encouraged to spend all of their allotted money because if they don t they don t get as much for the department the next year   Two observations First often government inefficiencies in purchasing are often inserted by politicians at the behest of lobbyists  it s not inherent to government  Second government agencies  do often negotiate prices  I can provide an example of both of these points from the SAME topic as this discussion  health care Medicare Part D The federal government is explicitly prevented by the legislation from negotiating prices for medications and many of the key players in passing the legislation took lobbying jobs for the pharmaceutical industry shortly after the bill passed This  no negotiation clause was bought and paid for by the pharma lobby However the Department of Veterans Affairs can  and does negotiate for drugs and pays on average  less than Medicare Part D  My  state gov agency just bought new laptops to replace our aging ones and we bought from a state approved vendor at state negotiated pricing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Does a mother have a right to damage her fetus if the result is to have a child 
PoliticalDiscussion,To balance this out if Bush did some of the things Obama is doing  Libya assassinations civil right incursions people would freak 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like right now  or what 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is wrong  If firms losing money don t lay off workers then firms making money can t hire them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The current reform did nothing to open up the marketplace  Correct me if I m wrong here but the exchanges that will open up the marketplace will not even go online until  So it is fair to say that the current reform hasn t done it but that doesn t mean it won t   I think the most effective part of the new law is the fact that  of premiums must go to paying for care and not too many people talk about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the dynamic of a failing middle class is certainly in play but it s localized and regionalized    What domestic protestors generally fail to realize is the  scale of the trouble in countries that take up arms or sacrifice themselves in the streets for a better world  Have you ever actually been to the Third World and seen how little of a social contract or tradition of participatory political system many parts of the world have  I know I know Detroit and D C match up on statistics like many third world countries  But they are part of a larger country that has as much stability as a place like Denmark  I too believe that the USA is heading in the wrong direction and that only something like the Arab Spring sustained over years will eventually dislodge our powers that be and hopefully replace them with something better  And it is certainly important to raise the issue of rebellion and protest  But equating where we are in this country with where other insurrectionist countries are does nothing but undercut your credibility  Pretty much the entire generation of youth have to decide things are so desperate and bad that they d rather be killed by sniper bullets than live one more day under this regime  And we just aren t there 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes so can insurance companies and they do  Listen I love all the  Government is always bad mmkay bullshit around here but I HIGHLY doubt you have any real experience in the medical field  When you go to get a procedure done you get a bill back for roughly x the actual cost of the procedure This is later  adjusted by insurance companies their way of saying  Fuck you we re not going to pay that much  in a relatively arbitrary fashion  So hospitals end up charging higher and higher amounts basically so they can keep that x markdown Everybody does it to keep up and health costs explode  The real cost in medicine isn t doctors it s not hospitals it s not even completely those obscene and un needed tests that get performed simply to pad the profit margin  It s administration  Everything becomes formalized everything has to be done in quadruplicate and argued back and forth forever and all this bullshit costs money and leads to obscene inefficiency because the game isn t about treating patients anymore its about figuring out how to get the insurance companies to pay as much as possible while the insurance companies don t have the option to just say  fuck your heart transplant  because then everyone would cry bloody murder  for good reason   The health organizations and their administrations know this and use this to basically blackmail insurance companies  pay for these  tests or we ll say you re trying to kill your patients  The insurance companies end up throwing money at the problem which unfortunately comes out of your salary independently  we really need to remove the tax exemption for employer funded health insurance  and this system becomes unbalanced  Find a way for insurance companies to say  fuck you this surgery is way too expensive  and you can restore market forces otherwise it s not workable  This is also why medicare is so obscenely expensive because even though they pay relatively little they HAVE to pay for all the bullshit tests doctors end up pushing to make their cash   
PoliticalDiscussion,I do have empathy    Responsibility learn it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I rarely turn down a free book 
PoliticalDiscussion,What if the mother is an alcoholic 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you missed the point of that statement It s that the government can afford to spend incredible amounts on healthcare  wasting a good portion of money and just pass the cost onto taxpayers without any penalty 
PoliticalDiscussion,Since when have Republicans been pro science Al Gore just got them motivated to speak out against THIS science issue 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But seriously let s not try to rewrite history here There s been enough written about it already  A public option is not the same as single payer   gt Pretty standard business practice for to trade a lower margin for a larger overall order  And the companies on the other side of the table would be the same companies that donate millions of dollars to the campaigns of those on the government s side of the table   Yeah I m sure that s going to go real well for us   
PoliticalDiscussion,Hahaha okay So easy for a male to say Empathy learn it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m going to address your points out of order I hope that s ok   gt if a health care company was going to sell diabetic supplies and contracts with a provider who has k customers they re going to charge a much higher margin than if that provider had  million people as would be the case with a public option  The government is notorious for making bad purchasing decisions and spending more money than is required to buy things The only reason buying in bulk is cheaper for companies is that they can negotiate the bulk prices When government agencies buy things they rarely negotiate prices  in fact they are actually encouraged to spend all of their allotted money because if they don t they don t get as much for the department the next year    gt Companies are going to compete like hell to offer the lowest rates and best services because such a huge amount of business is at stake  Why isn t this true now for companies competing between each other I ll actually answer this question at the end of this post   gt If universal health care runs a deficit but boosts worker productivity alleviates pressures on consumer spending and makes our exports more competitive by   reducing the cost of a new Ford by    those increases in revenue aren t going to show up in the bottom line of our health care budget but will have positive effects on our debt gdp   gt If universal health care runs a deficit but boosts worker productivity alleviates pressures on consumer spending and makes our exports more competitive by reducing the cost of a new Ford by    those increases in revenue aren t going to show up in the bottom line of our health care budget but will have positive effects on our debt gdp  You make a lot of assumptions about the quality of government services Can you think of another example of a US federal government run organization that is actually competitive with private sector business  I m genuinely curious if there is one I don t mean this to be a rhetorical question The only one I can think of is the USPS which wastes a lot of money and is much inferior to both UPS and FedEx  In general when the government gets into any new industry it can severely undercut every competing business by either running at a deficit or providing federal laws to protect their agencies but not competing businesses  Like how USPS mail is federally protected but FedEx   UPS packages aren t   As a side note you comment on how much Ford is paying for healthcare and how we need competition between insurance companies The fact is that it s impractical for health insurance agencies to compete for business as almost all health insurance is paid for by people s employers This is the case because of government intervention back in the s during the end of WWII the government enacted a policy forbidding employers from giving any pay raises In order to continue attracting new employees companies began to offer health insurance to employees as a form of compensation When the war ended and the federal mandate was repealed this practice stuck  This government intervention indirectly caused the current health insurance issue to come to be individuals no longer have a viable way to get health care as individuals  Also I m curious where you got your info for your BONUS statement a quick google search turned up  this   which suggests Sam s Club provides a better service to customers Sam s club is also a subsidiary of WalMart so I don t think a direct stock comparison is possible 
PoliticalDiscussion,the Democratic Party are run by pussies I cannot relate to that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s all be honest you can pick any topic   if Obama campaigned for and invaded Iraq over lies to disastrous results we all share today  Over a Trillion in debt and k lost lives  Fox GOP would not have apologize at every turn and not paraded Iraq as good policy Remember how they said it would pay for itself Imagine if Obama said that  it would be on endless loop today   It is because the only thing worse to Republicans than Obama as President is a successful Obama administration   They include Obama in the same group as Bin Laden very sad    At this point any bipartisan work is akin to losing to the enemy 
PoliticalDiscussion,It isn t just their body any longer 
PoliticalDiscussion,And considering medical science can push forward the time a fetus becomes a child  will there ever be a time when the definition of a fetus is no longer relevant  just babies on life support 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The government faces no such discipline  Yes because obviously if prices go too high people will simple stop getting so sick 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think your reason is incorrect  You know what the  individuals have  Numbers  Massive massive numbers   If everyone just up and peacefully just walked onto their local military base at a zombie s pace the military could do nothing to stop it 
PoliticalDiscussion,But this misses the point that a specific government function is not the same as a for profit corporation   If universal health care runs a deficit but boosts worker productivity alleviates pressures on consumer spending and makes our exports more competitive by  reducing the cost of a new Ford by      those increases in revenue aren t going to show up in the bottom line of our health care budget but will have positive effects on our debt gdp  And also you re both missing my point about business in bulk that if a health care company was going to sell diabetic supplies and contracts with a provider who has k customers they re going to charge a much higher margin than if that provider had  million people as would be the case with a public option Companies are going to compete like hell to offer the lowest rates and best services because such a huge amount of business is at stake  BONUS An interesting Costco comparison is that they have much lower turnover rates higher customer satisfaction and pay their employees much more than Sam s Club  a direct competitor  Despite the fact Sam s Club disappoints more customers and employees their stock performance is better than Costco Make of that what you will 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Also costco s costs are low because they sell in bulk Pretty standard business practice for to trade a lower margin for a larger overall order  That doesn t address Cassander s line of logic at all Costco has to make a profit to stay in business so it reduces its costs To do this they make deals with other companies which involve guarantee to buy large quantities   The government does not need to make a profit to stay in business they can run an enormous deficit which eventually costs tax payers more Buying in bulk is a side effect here not a method of reducing costs Generally speaking because government agencies are heavily lobbied when they buy in bulk they end up paying more than companies which must make a profit to stay in existence  EDIT it s   gt its
PoliticalDiscussion,But if profit is funneled away from CEO pay to workers there is probably a greater likelihood that  computers are attractive  And that many  computers will be bought 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cool I ll check those out Thanks for the discussion
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No this was never the goal of obamacare   Then the news was lying for months    But seriously let s not try to rewrite history here There s been enough written about it already  Also costco s costs are low because they sell in bulk Pretty standard business practice for to trade a lower margin for a larger overall order 
PoliticalDiscussion,Small critique you can have naturally arising monopolies but only if they out compete everyone else which is really a win for the consumers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most of the other redditors on that particular thread have covered it in one way shape or form Granted anecdotal evidence like the case of the Pennsylvania judge who would sentence juveniles to ridiculously long terms are clearly anomalies but for the most part the other posters are right If you give an entity a vested interest in the incarceration of as many people as possible then two things  Rehabilitation is going to be negligible simply because the stupidly high rate of recidivism in the US is profitable to them and  It gives them a reason to push greater enforcement of zero tolerance and drug laws Granted this is not always a negative effect One of the reasons that police will make an arrest on a domestic abuse call even if there is no witness cooperation is arguably because of prison influence on policy makers but the harm far outweighs the benefits as demonstrated by recent state crackdowns on drug use and other vice charges 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not disrespectful just pointing out their priorities  They don t care to understand or remain politically vested as long as their bellies are full and their is something entertaining to watch  Having this they would gladly turn a blind eye to a gov t which slowly tentacles it s way into their lives under the premise of their  safety   It s not that I m advocating revolt  Just trying to figure out what it would actually take to get Americans literally up in arms over something 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In case you weren t paying attention at the time the original goal of what is now referred to as  Obamacare was to create affordable health insurance for all through a universal single payer option  No this was never the goal of obamacare     gt Think Costco style savings  Costs at costco are low because if they get high costco will go out of business  The government faces no such discipline   gt Why are conservatives so upset about the individual mandate when it s a policy they d been advocating for  years  They haven t pushed it for  years  Some republicans did others opposed it  But it was never a legislative priority  There is also a vast difference between implementing it at the state level and implementing it at the federal  
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly it s because   The individual mandate was incorporated all wrong  Right now it s a penalty for not using a  service  when it should ve been a tax write off to get health insurance  I E  No health insurance when you file taxes  Less refund for you   The whole  Costco thing didn t work out  The current reform did nothing to open up the marketplace nor did it do anything to overcome state lines and their own crazy insurance requirements  Hence any  cost saving benefit was all gone 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe the bigger problem is that the federal government is the one imposing the individual mandate  The federal government is supposed to have limited powers delineated in the Constitution and nothing more  If this type of mandate is going to exist it needs to be done by the individual states like in MA  The federal government being able to force citizens to enter into agreements and buy certain products is an obscene power grab abusing the commerce power past its breaking point  As a person who doesn t really identify with either party that is my issue with it  
PoliticalDiscussion,That tone  The one deriding all Americans because they don t share your view point that instead of watching American Idol and eating breadsticks they should be overthrowing the government  Ignoring all the arguments about manipulative mass media shitty education and total apathy maybe they just don t agree with you  Maybe because they can put food in their and their kids belly work and still have time to enjoy their life is enough for them  Maybe just maybe it s not worth risking their and their families lives and liberty  You ll only win over people by showing them respect  The easiest way to make an enemy is disrespect 
PoliticalDiscussion,Inasmuch as I am rather loathe to opine on reddit for the simple fact that a great preponderance of the posters are of a liberal bent and their tolerance of anyone daring to go outside of their narrative has a tendency to get flamed in some fashion or the other by said liberal thinking folks I will sally forth nonetheless with my take on Al Gore  In my opinion he s a charlatan much in the same vein as Mohammed and L Ron Hubbard All of these characters have created a way to scam people either mentally or financially to line their own pockets or to acquire power in some specious manner Think about it within a historical and societal context before you rain down the vitriol please  That s my story and I m sticking with it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Serious question what kind of regulations does the government put up that would inhibit startups and how would would that increase costs Also if AT T wanted to buy your company out and give the investors a sizable return on their investment how would realistic is it the small start up would fight the good fight and turn down that kind of money 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say ours is more precarious given the level of comfort the middle class demands in the United States  In those areas of the world the middle class is considerably spartan compared to what we have here   multiple cars large homes big yards outdoor grills XBoxs HDTVs in every room cheap fast food etc  We have people in this country fighting and killing each over Air Jordans  Wait until food gas prices go up even more while our wages remain stagnated or if there is any major shortage  Egypt Libya Syria   they re used to shortages   in America we ll freak out when the supermarket is out of Tortilla chips 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How can you say you want something and then vilify the other side of the aisle for giving you what you wanted   gt Politicians say one thing one time and change their mind down the road  Pretty sure I answered a portion of your question that I felt like answering sufficiently in one sentence Not sure what else you wanted All I see from you is Republicans BAD   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So I would ask you what laws do you think they should put in place to make sure that all computers are sold for at least    Why would that be advantageous 
PoliticalDiscussion,But in the long run it seems like an elaborate shell game 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt in  then candidate Obama spoke out against the individual mandate pretty strongly because that was Hillary Clinton s healthcare reform plan  Very true and worth mentioning but I feel people also need to be reminded that in  President Obama still spoke out against the individual mandate in favor of a public option until it was clear there wasn t enough votes in the Senate without adopting the much more conservative individual mandate 
PoliticalDiscussion,But this is like the first chapter of Wealth of Nations  The subsequent chapters provide the caveats to invisible hand and lassiez faire 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for your intellectually enlightening logically sound and well cited argument  You re really raising the bar for quality debate here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Breaking news Politicians say one thing one time and change their mind down the road For a democrat example see Barack Obama  
PoliticalDiscussion,In labour economics assuming you have a perfectly competitive labour market workers will realise that firm a partakes in this sort of behaviour and know that their prospects of unemployment are higher with firm a Therefore employees will leave firm a and go work at other firms where the prospect o unemployment or risk is reduced This means The firm can t find willing workers and goes out of business   TL DR in long run free markets should regulate themselves  well that s the theory at least  
PoliticalDiscussion,My opinion is that politicians are very good at pointing out minute details  Meaning that even if both sides at some point wanted the same health care reform they would look at each others proposal and find a small detail that they don t agree with so that they can say that its bad for the country and whatever else they would argue    So its not necessarily that they don t want the same thing they just want to be the party that provides it to you  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My question is Why are conservatives so upset about the individual mandate when it s a policy they d been advocating for  years   My answer is it s politics as usual The other side did it therefore it s bad to republicans    gt How can you say you want something and then vilify the other side of the aisle for giving you what you wanted   Not sure but it s done all the time by both sides   Not entirely relevant but it s interesting to note that in  then candidate Obama spoke out against the individual mandate pretty strongly because that was Hillary Clinton s healthcare reform plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please enough already with wanting to create MORE laws for employers and businesses to follow 
PoliticalDiscussion,Comparing the state of our middle class to Egypt Libya Syria Bahrain etc is like comparing a firecracker to a nuclear bomb and saying that they are virtually the same since the both explode 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s nice in theory but what about something like say wireless providers Verizon and AT T could merge to create a monopoly  not saying this is likely or makes any sense but just for the sake of argument   With unbelievable startup costs needed to make your own wireless carrier How is it feasible a competitor would arise to break the monopoly This is doubly true when it s easy for companies to buy out competition rather than compete on equal footing 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I have noticed that I get less soap     Seems to me like you are dealing with inflation not a degradation in quality of the item My guess is that Zest realized that if they increase the per box cost they would lose customers that just look at per box cost so instead of increasing cost they reduced quantity per box   gt I thought of switching but I would get the same oz  for other brands   This points out that Zest was lagging behind in price they most likely could not continue to do this so they brought their cost up to market cost Again this is not a quality degradation it is simply inflation   gt Other more costly brands market themselves as higher quality  what my wife buys  but she has noticed that the bar gets slimy easily and loses quality over the duration  Exactly Regardless of how they manufacture themselves their actual quality matters to their consumers so that reduced quality gets noticed and eventually costs them customers This is the free market at work 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not know how unfair offering refurbished PCs as contrasted with new ones may be considered  I do not see it as much of a big deal as long as one gets a functional PC  Perhaps if everyone had a PC a person trying to sell one particularly a refurbished one might have a hard time of it  It is sort of silly to consider providing PCs to people if food and clothing are still an issue  I would say the wise way of funding it would be to raise taxes and reallocate spending  Printing borrowing at this point is not a wise option  Realtime Internet access with the instantaneous contrasting of any portion of the whole catalogue of available articles along with the creation of media presentations is only really feasible if one owns one s own PC 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have it backwards When the free market  goes to shit  i e Government steps in  you get monopolies and oligopolies   It is incredibly hard to create a destructive monopoly in an industry without Government assistance Destructive monopolies generally occur because the Government passes regulations which are easy for the big guy to conform to but impossible for smaller guys to conform to This creates a barrier to entry in the industry allowing the big guys to grow and charge whatever they want and buy up all the competition without risk of a small guy coming along and cutting into their customer base 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So the question is What if individual products offers no marginal value over the entire market Business is left with psychological tactics to entice customers not actual product durability Customer defection is caused by perception of  greener pastures to a large extent when compared to the reality of a defective product  Market collusion is also responsible for limiting customer choice A free market isn t supposed to have companies with partnerships to other companies the sell the same similar things That s no no number  Because if they do then they are no longer in real competition with one another and can all agree to reduce costs and can all agree to sacrifice quality and so the  entirety of society suffers rather than any one company 
PoliticalDiscussion,YOU would not  which is good  But if the rule is downvote only what you find offensive  wouldn t we just end up in a downvote circle jerk 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If the layoffs do not cause the quality of the product to decline  People continue to buy products even if the quality declines especially if that product is a necessity   gt If those layoffs do cause the product quality to deteriorate then the company will lose customers to competing companies  What if the overall industry suffers  My wife an I buy bar soap  I have bought zest soap for  years  the soap I use  I have noticed that I get less soap  I thought of switching but I would get the same oz  for other brands  Other more costly brands market themselves as higher quality  what my wife buys  but she has noticed that the bar gets slimy easily and loses quality over the duration  So the question is  What if individual products offers no marginal value over the entire market  Business is left with psychological tactics to entice customers not actual product durability  Customer defection is caused by perception of  greener pastures to a large extent when compared to the reality of a defective product   gt Your assumption that layoffs cause less people in the aggregate to afford products is also not sound  I guess the main measure is GDP  Has GDP grown  Has consumer spending increased  Has consumer spending without the use of credit increased  I mean credit increased  since   Doesn t that reflexively mean that aggregate wages haven t increased  not necessarily to the  level but to some extent 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m to the left of the Democratic party on social issues and some fiscal issues like welfare and taxes I don t quite identify with the populust anti corporate messages resonating within the party at times however  ironic given the username  
PoliticalDiscussion,Apples and oranges buddy Apples and oranges 
PoliticalDiscussion,Talking about politics usually involves saying X or Y should be done while Z should be stopped To me having an opinion like that and then not exercising your option to influence the outcome is hypocritical in exactly your definition If a man says something must happen and then does nothing to effect that change especially when he has the option to do so he is a hypocrite 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think an investigation will turn up anything The law in Florida is basically a  good Samaritan protection for vigilantism   Personally I don t want somebody in my neighborhood carrying a gun looking for  evildoers  
PoliticalDiscussion,My biggest problem is that after killing someone in an extremely suspicious situation Zimmerman wasn t taken into custody and investigated properly Whether or not he was attacked by Martin does not change this fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly There is so much ambiguity here that we should place a man in prison for life   I m just baffled at the indefensible mob mentality that is taking place over the whole incident and think that everyone should calm down until the investigation is complete Once it s complete we ll be able to tell at that point if justice has been done or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,the whole  use of force without congressional authorization thing
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope the witness bit was confirmed by police and the prosecuting attorney 
PoliticalDiscussion,The individual mandate is fundamental to how the plan works It solves the free rider problem  How would the free rider problem be solved otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even if Zimmerman truly did murder Martin this case has been based on the slightest bit of evidence that I don t think Zimmerman would ever be sent to jail  unless he was unlawfully carrying a gun   I ve never had any reason to believe otherwise regardless of my feelings about the guy and his actions on that day  I ve looked over these comments and what this case basically seems to be coming down to is Zimmerman s word against Martin s  Some comments say that Zimmerman used excessive for  According to who  The OP discusses the fact that a witness saw Zimmerman acting in self defense to which another commenter asked  What witness corroborates the story   If the side that thinks Zimmerman is guilty is stating what witness is corroborating the story how is there any argument against Zimmerman acting in self defense  With all of the conflicting problems in this story I just can t believe that Zimmerman would ever be jailed for the actions he took that day 
PoliticalDiscussion,What hypocrisy Hypocrisy means to say one thing and do another There is no hypocrisy in talking about politics and not voting unless  talking about politics includes telling people they should vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you   gt it forces those holding the power of the people to be accountable for their actions  Does it In practice I mean 
PoliticalDiscussion,I read your posts and found them very interesting   I agree that a vote on an individual level perhaps doesn t matter however i think it s important for people to vote as it s their civic duty  Voting keeps  or SHOULD keep people interested and informed on what their government is doing it forces those holding the power of the people to be accountable for their actions 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt we can only address poverty in one way financial assistance  This is absolutely false and absolutely the least effective means of addressing poverty   gt how else could you address poverty besides giving people money  You can get local communities to help out with education or you can provide tax credits to people willing to hire anyone who goes through a special program   Or you could get out of the way and remove the laws that lead to unemployment in the first place   There are thousands of ways to solve the issue of poverty anonymously throwing money at it is by far the least effective   gt you mean Pell Grants and student loan programs or Medicare and Social Security  These are not poverty programs most of the benefit goes to the middle class and the rich   gt how about disability and unemployment insurance  The inefficiency with which the feds do these is horrendous   States with similar programs are less bad but private companies that provides these services are still far better  As for the rest of your post thank you  I always know when I ve made a point that you can t refute and have no logical response to by counting the numbering of insults and swear words  So I m glad you are starting to see how much more thought you need to put into this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats the problem Zimmerman was following him because he looked  suspicious  Would you feel threatened as a black person in the south being followed who provoked who  Trayvon ALSO felt threatened  there is no  right here   A boy is dead 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve seen  stand your ground argued to mean if your legal actions lead you into a situation where your life is threatened you are justified in using deadly force to defend yourself As applied to this case it means you are legally allowed to follow someone you are legally allowed to confront them and ask them questions  even though you find the person suspicious and have been asked by dispatch not to do it  and you are legally allowed to kill them if the confrontation turns violent and you end up fearing for your life My understanding of the  duty to retreat laws is that if you find someone suspicious you have a duty not to approach them  even though it s generally legal for you to come up to people and ask them questions   My main point is in my opinion the fact that Zimmerman was getting his ass beat can t be used to justify using deadly force if he had an opportunity to retreat and instead choose a confrontation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote because if I didn t I would feel like a  massive hypocrite considering how much I talk about politics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well if you read the Federalist papers and or study constitutional law you will see that it really isn t my interpretation at all rather the classical understanding of what a federalist government is and how it is supposed to be run 
PoliticalDiscussion,Depends on what you consider to be  poor   Not being snarky or anything but your always going to have people at the  cut off who get screwed inadvertently 
PoliticalDiscussion,we can only address poverty in one way financial assistance  that s a one size fits all approach yes  of course it is  how else could you address poverty besides giving people money  or just provide them with the goods services they can t afford   and what are you on about  communities dying   WTF is that  and what  horrors come out of DC  you mean Pell Grants and student loan programs  or Medicare and Social Security  how about disability and unemployment insurance  you re right man  those things are so horrible  literally terrifying  i mean just the thought of my great grandmother getting a check every month so she can eat and keep the lights on is appalling  total fucking travesty that the federal government would DARE to pay for medical bills too  seriously are you some kind of a crazy person  or are you  years old  who am i talking to right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,You ignore all of the accounts that he abandoned the public option in private negotiations well before the issue of votes even came up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stop posting one sided titles with topics Especially if the topics can turn out to be as deep and interesting as this one COULD have been 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are lots of people who I would consider poor who have too much money to be on medicaid  They still pay very low marginal rates and get virtually no real benefit from tax write offs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then how is making them pay a penalty any better 
PoliticalDiscussion,Look around nationally there  police officers over a variety of roles  FBI ATF TSA CBP IRS Local and State police  and approximately  M armed forces on active duty and another  M in reserve    M uniforms you can put up  That means for every citizen there are about M citizens per uniform  Not to mention those uniforms are not all front line folks  Many are REMFs  paper pushers admin etc with different roles and responsibilities  M random people wreaking havoc is hardly something worth scoffing at  The only reason something this large has not happened yet is twofold   Technology allows the gov t to take these organizations down quickly when they sprout or even discredit them via media  No  tipping point yet  Just a thought 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No health insurance when you file taxes Less refund for you  This method would not produce the desired results The individuals whom this plan is aimed towards are those that cannot get insurance now This means that they are likely high risk individuals whose premiums would be quite high if they did get coverage The increase in their refund would more than likely not come close to outweighing what they would be paying in premiums The would still likely opt out 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would ve provided a tax incentive for having health insurance  Not forcing it via penalty  Honestly I think health insurance should just be treated as an expense and all income used on it would not be considered taxable 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it seems to me that the police and zimmerman are trying to cover their asses It s pretty easy to control the narrative to support your views when you ve already killed the person who d disagree   We have no idea who this witness is  but ABC says it was a  year old boy    TEeWMF    It also notes that the police didn t bother impounding the car taking a toxicology test or even speaking to a key witness  Trayvons Girlfriend that was on the phone at the time  To me this smacks of a PR move to try and change public opinion They want the narrative to be Zimmerman was just trying to do his job and this kid attacked him unnecessarily being more athletic and powerful More so he was just suspended from school for drugs related charges So you see he was the kind of black kid it s good to shoot cause he would have mugged you anyway  Zimmerman has a case to answer for but more so the police there have a bigger one Neither of them are reliable for information in this case 
PoliticalDiscussion,The poor are already on medicaid so this wouldn t really affect them   
PoliticalDiscussion,It may not be under a direct threat but it s being eroded little by little   hurt the middle class more than anyone else  The rich got a bailout the poor stayed poor and the family in the suburbs got fucked  Their situation albeit possibly improving is precarious  Is that a violent tipping point  Nope  But it s a solid grievance  IMO it ll take a lot less for Americans to get pissed off than the Arabs   Arabs were used to being pissed on by their government   Americans are just tricked into thinking it was rain  Just my thought though   usually it s stuff like this which leads up to something worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,The question is who provoked who Zimmerman was following Martin for some time he was also carrying a gun If Zimmerman confronted Martin aggressively while in possession of a gun it s reasonable to believe that Martin was acting in self defense However it s also possible that Zimmerman did not brandish the weapon until he used it and was first attacked by Martin But in either case Zimmerman was acting irresponsibly and outside of his role as neighborhood watch He was told that he did not need to follow Martin and is known to have frequently called the police to report  suspicious looking black males We also don t know if Zimmerman had been drinking or not because he was not taken into custody on the scene WHO ISN T TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WHEN THEY KILL SOMEONE    This is standard protocol to avoid a lapse in evidence  We will never know the other side of the story because Martin is dead Zimmerman will likely walk free because of the extreme vagueness of the  Stand Your Ground law and conservative assholes across the country will use this as evidence to support their bigoted ideals I expect to hear more than a few  I told you so s  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for a nation founded on the concept of revolting against tyrants I m curious to know what it would actually take to do it  Is it your first  hours of no electricity  No food for a week   gal gasoline  An executive branch rounding up a group of people and sending them to camps for  their safety and ours  A double dip recession  The breaking point varies from person to person but what would be the tipping point to accomplish this nationally 
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote to give my token opinion to society in the way provided to me That said the amount I feel I contributed depends on the locality of the issue position I m voting on Locally my vote counts for a lot Nationally it counts for nothing E g My vote for president counts for nothing since I vote liberally in a conservative state My vote is effectively overridden by the conservative majority But I do it anyways 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yep  Food stamp programs are intended to address a basic necessity of life food  Without food we die     and yet even with the new  credit card style food stamp programs there are people who sell the credits at pennies on the dollar for cash to get things the program does not cover  often drugs cigarettes or alcohol   If given free books they would do the same only moreso  Since books are not needed to live I suspect they would be sold at much higher rates 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I see no credible  witnesses coming forward and his ever changing story  several iterations thus far starting with his father claiming he never at any point followed Trayvon are pretty much shot to hell by the confirmed phone call to his girlfriend Will try to keep an open mind but at this point anything he says should be suspect as should mysterious adult  informants who only talk to the press 
PoliticalDiscussion,No its been the same as it was in the beginning indifferent because like everyone else on here I don t know what really happened and what I do know is what has been fed to me by the media over a period of time It s like making a judgement on someone s life because you read about it through high school gossip chain mail You guys need to put down your fucking pitchforks and let the judicial system do its job The over dramatization of this case is ridiculous 
PoliticalDiscussion,For which he refused to go to the hospital that night And the police felt was not severe enough to require him to go to hospital but only a minor patch up on site Life threatening Call me super skeptical 
PoliticalDiscussion,considering the initial accounts of the first on the scene officers i m withholding judgment until the feds go through things 
PoliticalDiscussion,One version of the bill allowed individual states to band together and offer the same plans across state lines This seemed like a reasonable compromise between blanket deregulation and no deregulation at all Perhaps that got cut from the final version 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I agree completely  gt Europe often is much more willing to pay taxes  take a look at the difference in price of gasoline The comparison between how much Europe taxes it to the US is extremely large  Getting to your point about the size of America I think its up to the states to implement the taxes that Europe is able to have The importance of state government is surely overlooked I dont think people care enough about what their state is doing and only want to think about the Federal government I think that if people started to push for things in their own states and allow change to happen on that level first we could go much further
PoliticalDiscussion,So i see how the situation you are proposing could work and might be able to sustain itself   but unfortunately thats just not possible in today s world if we are talking about the continental US In order to create these desirable environments it would require displacing inordinate amounts of people and completely rebuilding and designing new areas for these companies to move into This doesnt even get in to the funds required to take on such a project So all in all there wouldnt be enough support for this to occur given our present situation
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I find this a perplexing question as I see voting as very important  On an individual level It couldn t be less important You cast a tiebreaking ballot in a system that does not produce ties Your vote is merely an identity statement  I applaud you for starting this topic however It doesn t receive nearly enough attention  P S   If you re interested on a more extensive post on my reasons for not voting  or more precisely on the inefficacy of  vote signals   please read the following saved post    Note however that  my reasons for not voting may or may not represent others reasons 
PoliticalDiscussion,What witness corroborates the story 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we should look at how that got to be the case I blame the driving force behind the media In today s day and age everything must be quick From texts to tweets the majority of Americans only want to consume bite sized pieces of knowledge This leads to the marketers giving the consumers what they want   thats how they make money So the way information is broadcasted and what s being broadcasted is altered to meet the criteria set forth by the consumer What this leads to is the media being only able to attract viewers and interest if they cover stories that are  attention grabbing  What i mean by this is that they do stories that are easy to understand and are controversial This includes police reports any sort of tragic event things that people can go  wow about On the flip side this also leads to stories having less and less substantive information that people have to   think  about Not thinking about the world around you  self centered The rest should fall into place
PoliticalDiscussion,It depends on who instigated the fight If Zimmerman followed Martin for a while and then accosted him I d still lay the blame on him If instead he simply walked up and talked and Martin sucker punched him then my opinion might begin to change at least away from murder I m generally unfamiliar with criminal law especially in Florida but if I were to be responsible for writing a law I would say that if you are armed you have a duty to avoid confrontation Standing your ground shouldn t be a defense in a situation you initiated   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My question is Why are conservatives so upset about the individual mandate when it s a policy they d been advocating for  years   The US has a fairly unquestioning media overall which likes to center the truth somewhere between the Democrat position and the Republican position so as not to seem partisan or biased CNN is a particularly glaring example of this   If the former Republican position is agreed to by the democrats and the Republicans then denounce this position as  socialist or something like that and then move their position further to the right then that moves the national media narrative further to the right as well ACA is just one of many examples of this    It is the Republicans goal to always move everything as far as possible to the right so this works out particularly well for them   This isn t the whole story of course 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is no evidence of this A  witness called the media and claimed they saw Martin standing over Zimmerman The only person who claims Martin attacked Zimmerman is Zimmerman  Let s call facts facts And what you have posted here are not facts They are claims 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t because I think about it in terms of expected value  What will happen if I vote  What will happen if I don t vote  The answer to those questions is generally the same    Besides the candidates are effectively the same and the most important job of the president is nominating the people who actually get work done Fed chairman for example and even then it is usually done by a committee of party faithful with an eye towards the next election  I don t begrudge people who vote though 
PoliticalDiscussion, How the Heritage Foundation a Conservative Think Tank Promoted the Individual Mandate     Conservative paper from  cheer leading Romney s MA health reform    Also it was considered a strength of his in the last Republican primary when he was facing McCain Still featured as a strength on a  campaign website   see point   Other than that you ll have to dig up the articles from the last primary from your memory banks or the internets on your own I don t have the patience currently to dig up  year old news articles but his ability to enact reform and provide medical coverage was touted as a major plus from Romney back then and the Republican electorate seemed to agree back then At a bare minimum they didn t disagree until Obama copied him 
PoliticalDiscussion,At what point is it acceptable In my opinion when it gets to the point where the government doesn t protect and support the people and begins to strip people of their rights In other words now There aren t enough malcontents to have one though 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you re going to mention science then start with NASA s data that shows the Earth has not warmed in  years And probably will not for many more years thanks to all that Volcanic ash from Iceland I think  On top of that all the out right lies in Al Gore s movie And the fact that he s pocketing money from the massive scan that are carbon credits Add in the private jets and multiple SUVs that he   his staff drive around in His drivers have been caught more than once idling with the AC on for  minutes at events  Lastly checkout the carbon foot print on CFL bulbs that are loaded with toxic Mercury   gases They don t last as long as they re supposed to and they re all made in heavily polluting plants in China Then the blulbs end up in our land fills to pollute our environment far more than an incandescent bulb would  Enjoy your down vote from me for that loaded BS opening Do some real damn research before criticizing others especially because they disagree with you 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s nice 
PoliticalDiscussion,One of the beauties of free speech is that one group may be publicly saying something completely retarded but another group can publicly mock it Everyone s happy

PoliticalDiscussion,There is a really cool survey type program that is free to use   but I can t seem to find it 
PoliticalDiscussion,You anarchist You want everyone to die and without government there would be no morals and property wouldn t exist and the ROADS and evil corporations would take over and the environment would die and science wouldn t be funded YOU RE USING THE INTERNET YOU HYPOCRITE and Mad Max and what would prevent Walmart form buying everything in the world and AT T monopoly and Standard Oil and  The Jungle and there s NOT ENOUGH GOLD and who would ever pay for national defense and what if a meteor hits Earth and what about the impartial courts we have now and our Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Stand your ground is not an excuse for armed vigilantes to chase down strangers pick fights and when they lose hide behind a piece of paper That is the cowards way out  Chasing down a stranger suspected of wrong doing while armed changes Zimmerman s intent 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s more that social conservatives draw far more attention than fiscal conservatives Other than when Paul Ryan releases the GOP budget proposal you don t hear anything from him and guys like Jeb Bush and Mitch Daniels are also pretty low key   People like Santorum move the needle because some of their views are highly controversial where as nobody really disagrees with balancing the budget It s more what s the right way to do it and which programs need to be cut which is very boring topic  
PoliticalDiscussion,First off gas costs more in Europe because of taxes that fund their social services This isn t taxes that are causing the prices of gas to rise in the US it s speculation Specualtion because Obama s admin   is refusing to grant drilling licenses in the Golf to US oil companies yet Petrobrass is allowed  Flat out restricted coastal drilling at the Federal level instead of letting the States handle it  Refused the keystone pipeline that would send needed crude from Canada  Is blocking oil shale on Federal land  No drilling in Anwr had Clinton not blocked this that would be  million barrels of oil a day we d have now 
PoliticalDiscussion,The American Right has been especially vicious in defaming and insulting Al Gore ever since their stacked Supreme Court selected GWB as America s boy god king 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve said this elsewhere If Florida s  stand your ground laws allow a person to follow and confront somebody they find suspicious after being told by police dispatch  we don t   want  need you to do that and shoot that person when the confrontation turns violent then the law is unjust and the public at large would be better served by  duty to retreat laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the cost wage spiral    Really I had an answer for my question before I asked it unions  In the s  of workers belonged to unions   now it s something like    We need to aim for  again 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand the difference between gas   oil and I say we should be drilling more 
PoliticalDiscussion,great analogy Thanks so much for your response 
PoliticalDiscussion,Breaking news Republicans do evil shit and counter that the other side is just as bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,So it would only be justifiable to kill the thing while it was still inside the mother If you take it out to kill it it has left the body and is no longer the  property of the mother Would you agree with that 
PoliticalDiscussion, If the price of food or gas skyrocketed we wouldn t be facing a revolution We d be facing war against outside nations   As Carl Sagan used to point out with space exploration  once your desperate for resources you no longer have the wealth to obtain them If famine fuel shortages were the result of a Katrina event style gas spike personally I don t think we d go to war needlessly depleting the national oil reserve I don t see the precedent to assume that do you  If we did it would certainly provoke alot of strife here at home Same could be said if Iran closed the Red Sea to oil shipments in a war  we couldn t just swiftly unify   get our previous levels of resources People would be desperate unhappy and just as likely as not to blame whatever government could be perceived as causing the aggression or military folly Both hawks   doves would be angry   A war truly fought over resources wouldn t involve an occupation  how   why do you think Africa the America s and south asia were colonized Egypt by the Romans   It s hard to believe the but the US is pretty damn united when it comes to certain things and if it comes to actual desperation or fear people will lash out at whoever politicians tell them to   Its folly to discount dissent during times of war Vietnam Union   communism repression during the world wars Iraq War in   Those were not the acts of a unified country   Remember for individuals an armed revolution isn t so much political as it is the need to resort to violence looting rioting or other forms of dissent to feed families Few people in the FARC care about communism  they depend on the  succumb to the intimidation the FARC represents 
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote because not only does it actually have an effect whether the candidate I voted for wins or not but even if it didnt someone s gotta do it  Why do I think it has a real effect Because an election is not an island There is always the next election and when that time comes theyre going to be very interested in who voted for what the last time around In other words voter trends Voting gives your opinions a number that will appear in some statistic that political researchers and campaigners obsess over The idea that a vote is meaningless is utter nonsense  But even if your vote was meaningless as long as it wasnt the tie breaker I would still vote Here is why somebody s gotta do it and if you are familiar with the issues and you have what it takes get off your ass participate and vote I use this analogy society is a car where the engine turns off and breaks down every few years by design When it does everyone gets out of the car and pushes to get it started again and also to decide the direction it should go This is an election If you have arms and legs and can push then line up and fuckin push If someone said  my one push isnt going to make a difference so im just going to sit over here and wait until the car is started again he would probably be smacked and or left on the side of the road If he was allowed to get back in the car and had the gall to complain about the direct the car was going he would be thrown out the window Thats how i feel nonvoters who complain should be regarded in society Whiny little trolls  who didnt step up and push with the rest of us 
PoliticalDiscussion, There is evidence though     A broken nose lacerations on the back of Zimmerman s head blood on the pavement where Zimmerman s head was hit and at least one eyewitness that corroborates the story  
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you certain I m not sure but that is a very good point if that is true   If in fact it is not nationwide if we can t get simple single payer then couldn t congress just work to amend the law to open a national pool Isn t that a point that should be addressed   its also well and good to go and fight about the legality of certain provisions but shouldn t we work on improving the law if possible rather than destroying it in favor of the previous or status quo 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I m approaching it from a purely legal stand point    There is no reason to say he shouldn t have had the gun legally From what I understand he had every right under the law to have the gun on him    Whether or not Zimmerman picked the fight  which isn t exactly a legal term just because I follow you around my neighborhood doesn t mean you have the right to punch me However I ll concede that point for the sake of argument doesn t mean that as the fight progresses if Zimmerman  reasonably feels that his life is threatened he doesn t have the right to defend his life    If Zimmerman can prove he  reasonably feels his life was threatened using a firearm to protect his life is   legally allowed  in Florida  I m not a lawyer by trade nor do I live in Florida but that is my understanding of the laws in that state    I don t think Zimmerman is without blame but if he shot a person who was physically dominating him then   legally  I m not sure there is much legal blame to place on him 
PoliticalDiscussion,fair enough I would agree and say that if Iraq and Bush never happened then many would protest Obama for Libya no doubt  just like the Tea Party has fizzled out many have lost energy and focus over protesting war 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman shouldn t have had the gun on him in the first place   Zimmerman picked the fight the kid reacted when Zimmerman thought he was going to lose he shot the kid   Unfortunate yes murder  yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but he didn t and if he also tried to push a Libya fight people would be pissed   My point is that sometimes anger is selective 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just saying it would have pissed people off 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes on some level He should have some input    For example if she wants to abort and he wants to have the child he should have to pay for all costs associated with the pregnancy including any lost wages or out of pocket expenses and possibly pay some other negotiated fee for her troubles  Turn the tables around  Imagine a man and a woman have a one night stand  She gets pregnant should the woman have a right to decide that the man has a dependent for the next  years 
PoliticalDiscussion,While I don t want to jump in on this much I would like to point out that the reason for   gt The only one I can think of is the USPS which wastes a lot of money and is much inferior to both UPS and FedEx  is because FedEx and UPS both use the USPS to deliver a LOT of their packages anywhere that s not urban or even suburban  The USPS in many ways subsidizes its  competitors  
PoliticalDiscussion,Imagine a man and a woman have a one night stand She gets pregnant should the man have a right to decide what happens inside the woman s body 
PoliticalDiscussion,The inherent problem with American society especially when it comes to taxes is that everyone wants to see where every dollar they pay in tax goes whether they are paying for the roads for the education or for simply cleaning the streets if they can t see the money being spent they assume it s not being used  That s the problem Americans tend to think locally in their district or in their state never on a national scale so it s extremely difficult to promote a federal level change and equal distribution of taxes as people assume it s a hated Communist ideology for whatever reason  Comparatively Europe often is much more willing to pay taxes to help their nation as a whole whether that money from a Yorkshire farmer goes on healthcare in inner city London or a city banker is paying for small business loans in Scotland it seems to matter less but I think part of the reason is just the sheer size of America it s much more difficult to implement a federal plan over the vastness of America as it has so many different cultures and expectations for instance you have the Bible Belt and the Solid South of Texas Georgia Florida etc you have the Cities of the North East New York etc the Midwest and the West to contend with This compared with vast population differences there are only  million people in Wyoming and it s at least twice the size of Britain with a population of  million 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not pro life  I have no problem whatsoever with abortions  I m just not pro the woman gets to make  of the decisions with regard to the fetus and the man has to fall in line  Your analogies don t make sense because a pregnancy has already happened in the case we are talking about due to decisions that two people made  You can t equate decisions made to prevent a potential unwanted event with decisions made in response to something that has already happened  A pregnant woman s body is no longer just her own 
PoliticalDiscussion,The UK doesn t subscribe to the Bill of Rights and in the UK we do not strictly speaking have any right to a freedom of speech we have a liberty of speech meaning what isn t condemned is allowed It is a fine difference but a major one  Thus the BBC is perfectly fine to advocate censorship as it s a political idea that s quite popular to an extent in Britain Freedom of Speech sounds great in theory however in practice you get abuse of it in Britain we can stop abuse in America you cannot simply put 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well if he can make a reasonable case that he thought his life was in danger at the time he pulled the trigger it wouldn t be excessive force   And considering the physical advantage Travyon Martin had as well as the tactical advantage of sitting on top of him smashing his head into the pavement I don t think that s an unreasonable argument to make   Assuming all of this evidence turns out to be true 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not hypocrisy The statement is incorrect   He didn t say  I ll go this way and when re elected I ll go that    He said  I know which way I want to go but it ll be easier after I win re election Can we table this for now    One s a lie One s a polite request I can understand why a typical Fox News viewer could maybe confuse the two but I m pretty sure that the rest of the world went  Eh That s understandable  and moved on 
PoliticalDiscussion,Martin could have punched Zimmerman from behind or he could have broken his nose Not both  at the same time obviously  
PoliticalDiscussion,The police and DA have confirmed that that is what the witness said They have not confirmed that that is what happened 
PoliticalDiscussion,Martin was almost  pounds smaller than Zimmerman What physical advantage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Florida law explicitly prohibits police from arresting anyone who claims self defense unless they have overwhelming  can t remember the exact legal standard but it s high evidence to the contrary The officers and the department face serious consequences if they do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,A Where was Zimmerman s gun Concealed visible or brandished If a guy was following you and then walked up to you in the middle of the night with a gun how long would you wait before doing something about it  B Martin was giving up a hundred pounds to Zimmerman I ll believe the broken nose when I see a picture or an X ray 
PoliticalDiscussion,Martin    lbs  years old Zimmerman    lbs  years old  If you re going to insinuate that Martin was the more physically capable of the two I feel compelled to put all the facts out there  FWIW  which is probably not much  I am  years old and weigh  pounds and can not imagine a scenario in which a  pound  year old breaks my nose without having some form of fight training Football practice does not count 
PoliticalDiscussion,If your opinion remains that addressing INTENT is an emotional appeal without legal merit then I would prefer to listen to more learned minds discuss legal ramifications 
PoliticalDiscussion,You also have to consider Trayvon was recently suspended from school for posession of marijuna  I have nothing against pot and you shouldnt judge the kids character on that alone  But i know If i had just been suspended from school i d be pissed and practically begging for someone to assualt me so I could snap and let off some steam  You know that feeling Like you just want the next person on the street to say something slightly offensive to you so you have an excuse to wail on them  Not saying its right but its possible  Even i ve experienced it  To a  year old being suspended from school is your whole life  In the grand scheme its very insignificant but to Trayvon he was probably going through an emotional upheaval  Its entirely plausible that Trayvon did lose his cool and freaked out on Zimmerman    STILL Zimmerman should not have pursued him or instigated a confrontation in the first place     From what I understand there was a recent string of roberys in the neighborhood and Zimmerman as a homeowner probably did have at least some legitimate concern in the issue    This is a really tough case   I really do sympathize with both parties and it seems like the general public has already made up their minds based on very little actual evidence  
PoliticalDiscussion,nope he had strict orders to stay put from the police but chose to  go after him    my opinion still stands 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s not  working for free  He s trading those  days for the benefits and protections of living under a State 
PoliticalDiscussion,The fact the guy was a self appointed  neighborhood watch and carried a gun shows he was looking for trouble  Its a shame this Florida law protects vigilantes just like it would protect a good Samaritan 
PoliticalDiscussion,Comparing an off hand sound bite which is completely irrelevant  The Etch a Sketch idiocy to international relations and an issue which has been a contentious one for the last decade seems a bit silly Sorry   The other thing is that there are absolutely no new revelations here you just have to know a bit about the issue which I do since they want to put some of the US Radar bases a few miles from where I live the missiles will be in Poland and other countries surrounding Russia   First of all The populations of most of the countries don t want the bases Central and Eastern Europe have a pretty long history of occupation and they don t even like the idea of the EU let alone American missiles in their country which is basically drawing a perimeter around their old masters Russia Here in Czech Republic the support for the bases was only around   but even so when Obama came here to speak he praised the Czechs for standing up for freedom and Democracy and then in the next breath he spoke about how the missile defense must go forward regardless of what the people wanted   The other thing to remember is that Russia is a big talker They love to talk about getting involved in Syria or being against the Iraq war  Even though they basically voted for it as members of the UN Security Council  and they love to whip up populism and nationalism as a way to prop up their corrupt mafia leaders and keep the populace complacent So what Obama was actually saying here wasn t  I ll negotiate with you after the election I just need to act like I m against missile defense because everyone knows that the US wants to build these bases and they ll most likely get a few hundred more bases all throughout Central and Eastern Europe regardless of what anyone thinks  After all they don t even care that the populations of these countries don t even want the bases  What he is saying is  Russia don t act like a bunch of dicks in an election year You ve got your propaganda machine and I know that you need to keep your fragile plutocracy in place by scaring Russians about the American imperialist threat But since we both know we re bullshitting about the issue just do your bullshit after the election 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they run up on me I tell him that I just went to go buy candy for my cousin  If they run up on me with a gun I high tail it the fuck out of there unless I m carrying myself in which case I draw and fire  None of this physical altercation bullshit I m either gonna try and incapacitate them immediately or get out of there as fast as possible  Nothing in between 
PoliticalDiscussion,he looks great in a pair of shades simply the coolest looking leader in the world
PoliticalDiscussion,we ll never get an answer to that Zimmerman has likely lawyered up and will cover his ass asap 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman had a history of being the  self appointed neighborhood watch    with a gun  You re a black kid in a white neighborhood and someone following you shouts  HEY what re you doing here   who s scared If they run up on you what is your first reaction If they run up on you with a gun whats your reaction 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a good question  If Martin saw the gun then he was well within his rights to fight back  But  did he see the gun  There s the issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,did Martin see the gun before this If you see someone pull a gun you assume they re going to use it and  hopefully defend your life accordingly  There is plainly a victim here But are they just the victim of bad legislation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not if they just ask you what s up when you finally go up to them  Someone asking you a question is not life threatening and I think we can take it as a fact that they exchanged words before the assault occurred  Like I said I think it boils down to who hit first 
PoliticalDiscussion,I totally agree toadkiller but what is the definition of  threatened  If someone is plainly following you  and I doubt quietly is that threatening 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oddly enough I knew what you were trying to say   It just wasn t the time to bring it up The only reason to bring it up was to make some emotional appeal It wasn t in any way related other than the fact that it was the same event 
PoliticalDiscussion,Essentially boils down to this  If Zimmerman confronted Martin ended the argument turned to leave and was THEN attacked he had every right to shoot him and should walk free It s really that simple  If Zimmerman confronted Martin threatened him and was THEN attacked then yes Zimmerman is at fault and should be arrested etc Confronting a suspicious person in your neighborhood is not a crime people need to get that bullshit out of their heads and ignore the  zionist no less race hustlers  The most embarrassing part of this entire thing is that the president felt the need to get his opinion involved in a local matter that alone would lose my vote  if I had intended to vote for him  
PoliticalDiscussion,Right but isn t it reasonable to think that Zimmerman was threatening to Martin So was Martin s response unjustified  We also have to take into account that Zimmerman is responsible for the encounter He was reckless even after the dispatcher said that he shouldn t get out and follow this person  If you have a gun and start pursuing a person then expect to be attacked There is no good reason for Zimmerman following Martin around with a gun after the police were already on the way and now Martin is dead 
PoliticalDiscussion,You bring up an interesting point  I suppose if Zimmerman was the aggressor then Martin was in his right to use deadly force to protect himself    At this point we just have to wait until we learn who the initial aggressor was  I wouldn t count any verbal confrontations though  A person should be able to feel safe in walking up and asking a stranger a question without having any fear of physical retaliation  It comes down to who threw the first punch if Martin attacked Zimmerman first then Zimmerman was doing what he had to to protect his life  If Zimmerman turns out to have pushed Martin or something then it could be argued that Martin feared for  his life and was trying to protect himself from Zimmerman 
PoliticalDiscussion,What if Zimmerman  didn t pick the fight  What if he just said something to Martin and Martin sucker punched him and started beating on him  I d put  on a bet that when the autopsy reports come out Martin has no other physical wounds besides the gunshot  From witness testimonies and the evidence it looks like Martin suckerpunched him and started kicking his ass out of nowhere  Then we re looking at pure self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,good argument Thank you   Zimmerman was fearful and stalked martin Martin was fearful and stalked Zimmerman   Let s establish Zimmerman was the  initial aggressor who at the least instigated and made himself available to Mr Martin for assault Fair enough  Let s establish that Stand your ground applies to both men    Let s move off facts for a sec and say Martin too had a gun The law would apply to both either one could shoot the other and claim some level of fear for their life after a single punch is thrown Fair enough   Now remove the gun from Martin  Shouldn t Martin having stand your ground apply to him  feared for his life from an armed man be able to use lethal force Why should it only be through the barrel of a firearm Why not also with the environment and surroundings that can be used as a weapon to his defense   If I shoot you vs pound your head in the ground  Same shit one takes a lot longer so he is worse  I have to say this case really drives to the heart of these laws much like the Dread Scott case of the th Century   I hope it does not have the same outcome  
PoliticalDiscussion,Martin was killing Zimmerman though  He had him on the ground and was smashing his skull into the ground  It s not like Zimmerman would have been able to just throw him off and walk away he was already crying for help  He had two options at that point either shoot the man trying to kill him or let Martin kill him  He chose self preservation which thankfully is legal in Florida   
PoliticalDiscussion,See that evidence isn t proven the only fact is that Zimmerman did kill Martin on that I would say Zimmerman used excessive force because he had a gun with Zimmerman having the gun he had the power not to kill Martin but did anyway Even though you may not agree with this I am trying to think of it from a courts perspective and I would say that this was either excessive harm or manslaughter 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idiots in this thread are missing the fucking point    Trayvon Martin according to all evidence at this point attacked Zimmerman first and tried to  kill him      You can say  Oh Zimmerman shouldn t have followed him  all you want but the fact of the matter is that Zimmerman was well within his rights to walk up to this kid and ask him what he was doing  That s not illegal  What  is illegal is Martin then sucker punching this guy and breaking his nose and then bashing his head into the ground  Those are the actions of a lunatic teenager trying to kill this guy  Zimmerman probably would have died if he didn t have a gun you can t take repeated blows to the head for very long before you start getting permanent brain damage and all that jazz  Zimmerman made the mistake of thinking he d be safe in going and seeing what this kid was doing  I m sure that when the kid began smashing his skull in he realized quickly that he was out of options  That s why you carry a gun  For when crazy dickheads try to kill you by beating you to death on the side of the street  Edit  I don t want any of this  Martin s a child bullshit either Martin was a  year old male perfectly physically capable of beating and killing some stupid fat guy If Zimmerman hadn t have had a gun then Martin would be currently being tried as an adult for nd degree murder in Florida 
PoliticalDiscussion,No  it is precisely the point You seem to want to make a case for the shooter at the point of altercation I am saying that what happened prior to the altercation goes to intent You are focusing on the fight It doesn t matter This man followed an innocent person despite the warning from the  operator not to This shows INTENT   And to be exact about it    this whole incident is not a political discussion its a legal one that none of us here are qualified to answer properly But certainly there are politics of race involved here   But   again yes   I asked if you had ever chased a black kid I want to know about the intent   I dont care about the altercation that is only a result of the intent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman is an idiot yes  He saw some kid walking around and decided to make a big deal of it  However it looks like he did NOT intend to hurt the kid  He looked for him then was going to get back into his car when Martin walked up and accosted him  Zimmerman probably quickly realized that he had stuck his nose where he shouldn t have and probably got real scared real quick  That fear was confirmed when that kid started beating his ass mercilessly  It s not Martin s fault that someone found him suspicious BUT IT SURE AS FUCKING HELL IS HIS FAULT THAT HE BEGAN MURDERING THE MAN IN COLD BLOOD  He was  bashing Zimmerman s head into the ground  That s what you do when you want someone to either have permanent brain damage or DIE  Zimmerman had to do something to save his life  Sure it s Zimmerman s fault he wanted to make sure Martin wasn t up to any trouble but it s not his fault that the kid attacked him and tried to kill him  Martin should have walked away too not started beating on some fat guy 
PoliticalDiscussion,What point did you make It is totally irrelevant to the discussion that flibadab and I were having Completely and utterly beside the point   Flibadab was stating that Zimmerman couldn t have been knocked to the ground with a punch by Martin I asked if Flibadab had any fight experience to back up that assumption    And you asked me if I d ever chased a black kid   It s not a point If that s what you think a  Political discussion consists of I m not interested in participating in it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No matter how right you may be I find that if during a political discussion someone asks if you voted and you are unable to say yes you instantly lose any high ground you may have had I am not above having selfish and petty reasons for my own actions 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re saying that if somebody started bashing your head into the ground and you had a gun in your jacket you  wouldn t shoot the person trying to kill you  Martin was trying to kill Zimmerman  He was bashing his head into the ground  That s trying to kill someone  
PoliticalDiscussion,and here we go with the insults just because I disagree Why not answer the point I made This is political discussion not r politics   so take your insulting manner elsewhere
PoliticalDiscussion,You must think solely from the gut Do you bother to use logic and reasoning in everyday life or do you just use knee jerk reactions in every aspect of your life   Move along child leave the reasoned discussions to the adults 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes Obama is black and Romney is white mexican We know What is your point s   But seriously how are these things different 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama didn t say he would act one way and then another   he said he wanted to ease up on the issue until after elections  not CHANGE his entire stance   
PoliticalDiscussion,yes because the neck bearded basement dwellers on reddit know ALL about fights
PoliticalDiscussion, Hypocrisy in politics Oh yes From my side of the spectrum Never  redditor Also downvotes post about calling out the lefts hypocrisy 
PoliticalDiscussion,ever chased down a black kid just because he was walking through your neighborhood even though the  operator told you to stay put 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which I agree with because people see America as a single country they assume it should change like most country s do but with the struggle between federal and state power very little can change nationally it s up to the states to change but often they don t follow suit if one starts 
PoliticalDiscussion,if you were black you would not feel that way 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay so I may have not used the right league tables but my point remains the same Universities in Europe still compete with American Universities for much lower fees you say that the fees are actually paid in the taxes we pay here but that s not entirely the case with America you pay federal and state tax thus your tax rate does actually rise to somewhere close to European tax rates Sweden is an extreme example of taxing in Europe and the general tax total comes to roughly   of your income for the majority of people  The  also covers healthcare and deep welfare programmes that aren t available in the US so in total you are much better off going to a European university if you are looking at simply fees   If you want an example of a free university just look at Scotland pays a similar tax rate to England  for most  for those over  and gets free tuition 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well first of all the evidence does have to be true and even if it is in a lot of courts he would still be convicted
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry about your downvotes  Welcome to the liberal circle jerk that is r PoliticalDiscussion  Most of the comments below are making some very very bad assumptions  Zimmerman can in any jurisdiction claim self defense once a fight has broken out so long as he reasonably feels his life was in danger  Both the witness and Zimmerman reported that Martin attacked Zimmerman and was bashing his head into the ground  That is enough under any legal standard and in any jurisdiction  Additionally the comments seem to disregard that Zimmerman told police the night of the incident that Martin reached for Zimmerman s gun  That is also enough  This whole thing has been blown out of proportion by racial activists that are more concerned w  establishing a narrative than w  getting to the truth  The racial activists have already won  The medial almost assuredly will not report as extensively on this issue once Zimmerman is exonerated  And the media reporting thus far has been horribly biased  childhood pictures of Martin calling Zimmerman  white  disregarding Martin fighting reporting unchallenged the  c  n slur etc   This is the same as the Jena  Duke Lacrosse the Davis Execution etc  The truth doesn t matter when there s a chance to accuse white people of hating black people 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the US two party system we tend to have a sports team mentality All Republicans are one team and the Dems are on the other In this mentality all you care about is your team winning and the other team losing   Basically they oppose it now because the other team did it  You seem to have this mentality too    gt Conservatives spend  years pushing for a policy only to complain when they get what they asked for  Group the opposition as a homogeneous team Criticize them to make your team look better   gt the original goal of what is now referred to as  Obamacare was to create affordable health insurance for all through a universal single payer option  This is just false Single Payer   Public Option 
PoliticalDiscussion,The repercussions for not having insurance must be greater than the cost of purchasing it Simple tax deductions couldn t achieve that fine s could Although the mandate without massive systematic reforms is a flawed method regardless of the execution And subsidizing a purely private industry is inefficient and increases prices the only way the government could ensure full coverage without skyrocketing prices is to provide a single payer option and let private insurers fend for themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree almost entirely with what you have said here However public policy has over the past  years and more heavily since Bush Jr progressively been geared toward lowering wage pressures Once protective laws and regulations are in place then some percentage of what a free market would normally drive toward wages gets frozen out of wages   Unfortunately this ill conceived notion that cost savings by way of fewer more efficient workers by definition fails to drive wages conflates some very real problems with quasi monopolistic public policies with bad economic reasoning You get an upvote for properly addressing the free market economic side of the issue anyway Many very real public policy issues still need addressed to deal with lowered wage pressures in general Though given some time this will also be addressed with another political swing in the opposite direction which tends ignore the economic limits of the ideologies that drive it Both sides have valid points if properly contextualized to the actual economic conditions Both sides just seem blind to any validity but their own one sided view 
PoliticalDiscussion,In a presidential election depending upon what state you re in there is absolutely no reason to vote Take my state for instance Every election since  has gone Democratic The way our system is set up individual votes don t matter There are a few states that do split their electoral votes however  On the flip side voting in local and state elections is ridiculously important considering that your individual vote actual does matter 
PoliticalDiscussion,Occam s razor  Zimmerman had a month to work out his story   He left out the part he got in the kids face and caused the fight then says he is attacked from behind as he is trying to get back to his car like a little kid    EDIT thanks guys 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is Reddit a place for college aged liberals to to bask in the echo chamber not a place to debate evidence and reason ideas out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the police collected no forensic evidence we ll never truly know 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt    less people in the aggregate can afford products these businesses can produce    You seem quite worried about these businesses as a  going concern  sarcasm  It makes me glad though to see people who feel that there is obviously a wrong somewhere and feel something needs to be done The problem is that they often fail to put much effort into finding exactly what this problem is   gt The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism  are forced indeed so to spoil them They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty by hideous ugliness by hideous starvation It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man s intelligence and as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought   Accordingly with admirable though misdirected intentions   they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see But their remedies do not cure the disease they merely prolong it   Indeed their remedies are part of the disease     gt They try to solve the problem of poverty for instance by keeping the poor alive or in the case of a very advanced school by amusing the poor   gt But this is not a solution it is an aggravation of the difficulty The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim   Just as the worst slave owners were those who were kind to their slaves and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it and understood by those who contemplated it        Oscar Wilde  The Soul of Man Under Socialism   Although I find Oscar Wilde s faith in Socialism ultimately misdirected as well this passage is dead on My ardent advocacy of free markets is usually with the aim of not only illustrating the justness of it but also to cause people to think much harder about the  problem they wish to remedy to meticulously trace effect to cause  There are three factors of production land labor and capital The results of the combination of these  factors  the produce are split  ways amongst the owners of these factors Wages to labor Interest to Capital and Rent to Land The laborer is obviously the source of labor and so his ownership and control of his labor is completely justified The Capitalist for simplicity invests his wits time and energy to produce tools  capital which greatly enhances the effectiveness of labor and so his ownership and control of the fruits of his labor is completely justified How do you justify the private ownership of land The largest chunk of the produce goes to the one who contributes absolutely nothing to production He could sleep through it all   gt The tower leans from its foundation and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe   Henry George  All I can do is recommend  Progress and Poverty  Henry George   for you The following is an excerpt from the introduction which you can read  here     gt This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times It is the central fact from which spring industrial social and political difficulties that perplex the world and with which statesmanship and philanthropy and education grapple in vain From it come the clouds that overhang the future of the most progressive and self reliant nations   It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization and which not to answer is to be destroyed   So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes to build up great fortunes to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast between the House of Have and the House of Want progress is not real and cannot be permanent The reaction must come The tower leans from its foundations and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe To educate men who must be condemned to poverty is but to make them restive to base on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions under which men are theoretically equal is to stand a pyramid on its apex  edit   JUSTICE NOT CHARITY  
PoliticalDiscussion, Conservatives have not been pushing for an individual mandate  This is disingenuous and equates  Republicans with  Conservatives and pretty well demonstrates a shallow understanding between the two   and a general lack of history 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I ve seen numbers that say productivity continues to rise in spite of high unemployment  Employment is not a good measure for this You need to consider the fact that the population has grown too Check  em ployment rate vs population and you ll see that we actually have more workers now than we have had in the past despite slightly lower rates   gt My feeling is there is collusion in the marketplace  The economic term for collusion is a cartel Cartels are inherently unstable because there is a large incentive for cartel members to betray and undercut their confederates There are generally two models that we look at in this case  Bertrand   and  Cournot      Generally a cartel with few members will have a price that is lower than the monopoly price and higher than the perfect competition price The larger the cartel  in number of firms  the closer the price approaches to the perfect competition price  The most notable exception to cartels being unstable is when they use government to protect themselves most often through  regulatory capture   The example you site with cable and satellite TV is largely because of policies taken by the FCC arguably due to the influence companies have on the regulators who run the FCC  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt and makes our exports more competitive by reducing the cost of a new Ford by      This is the biggest economic fallacy ever  There is no such thing as a free lunch   If you lower ford s costs  a car by government spending the government has to raise taxes by  a car to fund that spending  The net cost is the same all you change is whose books the expense is on 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Two observations First often government inefficiencies in purchasing are often inserted by politicians at the behest of lobbyists  it s not inherent to government  Umm it absolutely is inherent to government  Such a thing is only possible when an institution is run by politicians who must get elected not mostly self selected managed  You ll notice that the same thing almost never happens in the private sector and when it does it tends to drive the offending entity out of business rapidly or is vastly illegal    Even worse you are admitting the government is corrupt  But any expansion of government will go through the same corrupt process  Asking government to fix itself is like asking a man standing in a bucket to lift himself   gt This  no negotiation clause was bought and paid for by the pharma lobby  I agree  So how on earth do you think that giving the same government that is already demonstrably corrupt MORE POWER is going to make things better  I will never understand how people can simultaneously believe that the government is bought and paid for and that we should give it more money and let it make more decisions 
PoliticalDiscussion,when you say justified    Zimmerman was not where he should of been and martin was innocent The fact they were in a fight was because of Zimmerman I know getting your ass kicked can be life threatening but Zimmerman is fucking playing in traffic here he is the tool that started this mess He was also up and about immediately after shooting so he was NOT in serious injury Like a woman his idea of pain and life threatening beating does not mean it was    That is the problem I have The other possible scenario that fits perfect is Zimmerman getting in the kids face and warranting an ass kicking then bailing because he is a punk while Martin following him and them fighting Make up story that  going back to my truck after looking for street sign  in middle of block when I was jumped just really  sounds lousy like something my kid would make up   If he was a better fist fighter he would not need to shoot him If he would of stayed in his car none of this would of happened The cops would show up and find the kid was fine everybody go to bed Instead   All I come away with above all else  Zimmerman is a huge dick He is safer being arrested and having a real crime scene and investigation for his own protection     Ironically now he truly does have to fear for his life whenever he sees a black man     Be careful what you wish for   
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with you Too bad it didn t happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because there actually IS a difference between the politicians in the two parties 
PoliticalDiscussion,Who doesn t go to the hospital when he has a broken nose  And this is not  evidence  this is Zimmerman s latest claim  Look I know you re trolling or even scenario testing but what s your scenario here  Did Martin hide in the bushes with his box of Skittles waiting to ambush Zimmerman  Or did he threaten Zimmerman and then Z pulled his gun and Martin was like  O shit I better break his nose    And look at you  In the title you say  there is EVIDENCE coming out    but in the first line you say  It MIGHT turn out that      Lawyer troll dittohead troll what 
PoliticalDiscussion,  This time a neighbor is rebutting George Zimmerman s claims of self defense and trying to help Martin after the shooting Mary Cutcher and her roommate say they went outside after hearing shots fired and spotted Zimmerman on top of Martin  straddling the body basically a foot on both sides of Trayvon s body and his hands pressed on his back  Cutcher told MSNBC adding  Zimmerman never turned him over or tried to help him or CPR or anything        And for me it was a shock to see oh my God that it s a kid So skinny baby faced  said Cutcher s roommate After the shooting Zimmerman just walked around with his hands on his head like he was in shock Who was crying during the incident is also a muddle The crying  sounded young  said Cutcher  It didn t sound like a grown man is my point It sounded to me like someone was in distress and it wasn t like a crying sobbing boo hoo it was a definite whine      sounds like if his side is true at best Zimmerman is a  whiny cunt who thought he was a tough guy chasing street crime 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s hard to hear something like this ecause every bone in my body wants to be for Trayvon but if it s true anyone in his position would have done the same thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,That witness is very suspect because there was no witness noted in the police report and the anonymous witness only came about a month later after nationwide protests and marches   I see what you are saying that he if he really did feel like his life was endangered he would have the right to fight back The problem is George Zimmerman pursued Trayvon and confronted him after police said not to Zimmerman created the environment for himself to feel in  fear of his life If he had stood his ground instead of acting confrontational none of this would happen   As well as all of that information George Zimmerman did not to go to the hospital Any of those horrible wounds would mean you would need to go to the hospital if they were really that bad Trayvon is dead Who do you think feared for their life more The guy being stalked or the stalker  
PoliticalDiscussion,At the time he pulled the trigger  Didn t he have to chase him down to shoot him 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well then the free rider problem can be easily solved through a true public option which is funded off taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Voting is about the least significant political act you can possibly do  In fact I d say the talking about politics has more effect than one vote ever will 
PoliticalDiscussion,there would of never been a confrontation if Zimmerman listen to the   officer and stopped pursuing Martin This wannabe cop thing is what cause this mess The cops were on the way he was told to wait by the mailbox for the arriving officer on the extended   tape  His alibi is too tight as if it was to cover up all the crucial points of guilt  It was obvious he was worked up on the call chasing him He verbally said he didn t want to let him get away     I feel deeply that he confronted Martin exchanged words and then got scared and walked back to his truck I could see Martin following him being mad he was stalked   The fact Zimmerman carried his firarm in condition  with a round int he chamber along with the evidence that there was an empty chamber upon inspection by the officer on the scene this means Martin grabbed the barrel to try and stop from being shot The forensics will show martin on top holding the firearm from below while Zimmerman shot him in the chest   I believe Zimmerman would of shot him if he got up and ran before hitting his head Martin was essentially shot from the first punch thrown  Zimmerman can not handle himself in a fight and panicked He above all else was never professional through the encounter   Being stuck to take his word is not a good position to be in We need more evidence and realize vigilantism in any form should be illegal   I blame Zimmerman s insistent stalking and panic along with Martin s stand your ground attitude that led to the shooting If we apply stand your ground to one we have to the other   Martin was in fear of his life too    Both parties are wrong to some degree but Zimmerman would of never had the opportunity to shoot Martin if he stayed in his car The bulk of the blame is with Zimmerman    You don t confront people in the street without expecting the possibility of being attacked having a gun should not make it a better reason Being neighborhood watch he is trained in this so when he was coming back from the store  not on watch he should of still reacted with his training not emotion which is obviously incriminating from the tapes     EDIT It is also reported by witnesses Zimmerman was holding Martins face  down in the grass after shooting him This is a far cry from a person with a broken nose and fractured skull seconds from death a min a go  They said he was very aggressive so this is also a factor How bad was Zimmerman actually hurt and as people started to appear Zimmerman could not of had enough time for Martin to kill him in this method Having the firearm at this point is a liability as Martin could grab it  Again unprofessional Guards in prisons do not carry weapons when near prisoners for just this reason   Zimmerman put himself in jeopardy to his own fault and then shot his way out of it It was not Martin s fault he was scared It was not Martin s fault he was being stalked It was not Martin s fault the man he is fighting has a gun and since he does  one of them has to use it   Really twisted fucked situation Zimmerman is a huge dick here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course not  Why on earth would I let something trivial like the evidence interfere with a feeling as delicious as righteous indignation 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There s a problem if people can choose not to pay into the fund until they get sick That s what the individual mandate solves  This is exactly what I was referring to as the free rider problem People reaping the benefits of coverage that s harder to deny without propping the system up before they get sick  I personally believe that there is something inherently immoral about profiting off human life like a health insurance company does but I sure as hell don t have any answers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the article I had directly prior to posting about the case didn t have his weight listed except for user comments I didn t want to cite a weight that wasn t correct   The article was on MSNBC before you accuse me of getting my sources from a right wing editorial   Honestly though if Martin threw the first punch  especially from behind as all accounts state so far then it s not to unexpected that he would get the upper hand A broken nose is painful and can be momentarily debilitating if you aren t used to the sensation There s a reason boxers will often have it broken before their first bout so they aren t surprised by the pain and stop early the first time it happens to them in the ring  
PoliticalDiscussion,What free rider problem are you talking about  I mean there s a problem if people can choose not to pay into the fund until they get sick That s what the individual mandate solves  But if you instead fund the healthcare system off taxes  which is what the public option does  then the choice aspect goes away and so does the free rider problem  Some people think it s a problem that sick people can get healthcare even if they re poor and they call that the  free rider problem  Is that what you re referring to 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if you re so sure about this why did you neglect to mention his weight in your selective portrait  
PoliticalDiscussion,I figured as much   It s not ludicrous At all 
PoliticalDiscussion,No  I avoided them because I was a  lb    teenager who knew enough about physics to realize that my skinny arms just didn t have enough mass to knock down someone who outweighed me by  lbs 
PoliticalDiscussion,They would sell them anyway The welfare recipients don t read and don t want to read 
PoliticalDiscussion,THANK YOU This is what I come here for 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a conservative I identify most closely with the republican party  Where I differ off the top of my head   I am a strict Constitutionalist  This means restricting government to the functions specified in the Constitution not finding ways to twist the Constitution to justify what you want to do  It further means that the Federal Government should be prohibited from passing unfunded mandates on states or individuals and then providing funding contingent on behavior it cannot legally require   Whatever your views on homosexuality opposition to it is a lost cause  Accept that and move on   I am a fiscal conservative  This means that fiscal responsibility starts not with  reducing spending  meaning reducing the rate of increase or  reducing the deficit but rather with eliminating the deficit by spending less than we take in  It further means spending enough less than we take in that we can begin paying down the national debt   I am in favor of legalizing drugs  Legalize and tax  The period between the th and st Amendments proved that attempting to prohibit a recreational substance that people want to use does not work no matter how much money you spend   I am against corporate influence in politics  This means we need to change laws and or get Constitutional Amendments passed to eliminate it  This should include things like making all campaigns publicly funded and making private funding of campaigns illegal once a candidate is on the ballot   I am in favor of eliminating illegal immigration  This is possible to do via a combination of enforcing existing legislation and introducing new legislation to require employment eligibility verification prior to employment punish knowing employment of illegals with prison terms and putting a cash bounty on illegals with the aim of arresting them and putting them in prison at hard labor before repatriating them  The funds for the cash bounties would be obtained via fines on employers found to be employing illegals  With the illegal labor force removed we can then adjust immigration policy for legal immigration as necessary to increase the labor force if we find the labor force is insufficient   I favor a national sales tax to replace the income tax system   While I am generally against corporate taxes I favor a tariff on companies where a significant portion of the workforce  to include parents and subsidiaries is outside the US  Come up with a threshold percentage and if your company exceeds the threshold you pay the tariff   I am against HB and L visas and believe that corporations should be training US workers to fill those positions rather than bringing foreign workers in at depressed wages   I am in favor of holding the nation its laws and the enforcement of those laws to the ideals on which the country was founded  This means adhering to the principles  not finding ways to weasel around the letter of the law to do underhanded crap in the name of expedience or security 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t have a business if you are bankrupt They can t just use monopoly money or make their own 
PoliticalDiscussion,Citizens are afforded certain protections under the law with special protections for citizens who are minors The whole abortion debate boils down to where do you draw the arbitrary line beyond which a fetus becomes a citizen Children are not property of their parents as some people like to say but citizens with whom the obligation to care for falls primarily on the parent s by force of law So for instance you could not sacrifice your child as an offering to your god 
PoliticalDiscussion,One thing that bothers me is that people keep repeating the fact that Zimmerman weighs  pounds I also weigh  pounds and I m  I haven t been in a fight since th grade which I lost and I feel my weight would not give me much of an advantage It would be a disadvantage because I m overweight and a little out of shape and a  year old kid in great shape could probably kick my ass even if he was a light weight 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes well the news and people have sensationalized this beyond belief Personally I don t have a declarative position on whether he is guilty or not I don t think there is enough evidence to prove he is guilty I have a mild opinion that Zimmerman probably broke some law If we had perfect knowledge then yes we could get him for something but probably not murder This first opinion doesn t matter because I don t think there is enough evidence to decide any way for murder or not murder So my prediction is it either doesn t go to trial or it goes to trial and he gets off from murder charges I like this guys take on it  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt and then not exercising your option to influence the outcome  The chances of your individual vote changing the outcome of a major election is zero In every election you have ever voted in and ever will vote in the outcome would remain the same whether you voted for the heavenly Democrat the evil Republican or if you had just stayed home Even if by some miracle it was close enough for your vote to actually count  it still would matter because all that happens then is the courts decide the winner e g Bush Gore 
PoliticalDiscussion,Come on you know why   People judge based on their gut and use their mind to justify that decision after the fact 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you This video does a good job of stating the same thing  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ever been in a fight 
PoliticalDiscussion,Did he fucking say he that is the reason he did that The stand your ground law Holy hell people Was he just planning on killing someone and using that law as an excuse How does this comment have  upvotes and This isgonnahurt have  karma 
PoliticalDiscussion,Okay I m registering a new account and calling myself communosyndicalist  It s representative of my belief in markets and private ownership of the means of production 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The   year old football player  The   year old  former football player who weighed  pounds He stopped playing football when he was   From what I ve read Zimmerman weighs  pounds  The idea that a kid that skinny could knock down a  pound man with one punch seems ludicrous  
PoliticalDiscussion,See your local laws  Blank is generally not considered a vote but if people wrote in  Mickey Mouse or some other candidate that is for whatever reason ineligible one of three things would happen   The election would be decided by arbitrage among people in power  There would be a second election  The election would go to the next   valid  candidate with the highest amount of votes  The seat would remain unfilled  This doesn t really come up often so the rules for it vary depending on what election you re talking about and where you re located 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would feel threatened as a white person anywhere being pursued by anyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,exactly   not enough up votes for you  this is the key point of the whole incident    The police tapes show that he was instructed not to follow Martin by the  responder An order he disobeyed   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Sort of like I can break my own stuff on purpose and it wouldn t be vandalism   Only under certain conditions  You can t take a rocket launcher to it  You can t intentionally wreck your car on public property  We place limitations on these actions  So let s say a fetus is considered a mother s personal property   should we forcefully prevent a mother from being an alcoholic or crack addict  If not society takes on the burden  tax dollars  to go towards the maintenance of this  once property   Millions are spent in special education because of the irresponsibility of the mother  Should this become my burden and my child s burden whom I was responsible with and have him receive a diminished education because child with fetal alcohol syndrome needs extra extra care  A pitbull is property  But if the owner takes that dog into a dog fight the dog becomes vicious  What if that dog mauls my dog  Similar situation  A mother s irresponsibility with her property causes harm to my property i e tax dollars the commodity of education   
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t understand why people don t understand this   if you pursue me at night I m going to fuck you up    
PoliticalDiscussion,Psychology studies have shown that eyewitness testimony is rarely accurate This isn t enough to implicate either person  There are others who say that Zimmerman was standing over Martin so who s in the right Nobody knows 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you break into the tiger cage at the zoo and stick your finger up its ass that doesn t make it ok to shoot the tiger when it tries to bite you
PoliticalDiscussion,Ahahahahahahaha  
PoliticalDiscussion, If someone picks a fight has it escalate and uses a lethal weapon in self defense he was justified in protecting his own life but  he s also guilty of starting a fight that escalated into murder He s guilty of murder  It s a similar rationale to driving someone to a simple  hold up where if the hold up turns to murder without the driver s knowledge or influence the driver is still guilty of murder 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a fantastic reply If you have a gun you should not initiate contact with someone because you know that if they get violent with you you are able to kill them You know that if you don t initiate contact they will not have any reason to get violent and you will not be in a position to kill someone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Uh can we get some details Like an article or something And if it was banned in r energy it s probably for good reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you can t prove that Martin s intention was to kill Zimmerman not merely hurt him 
PoliticalDiscussion,If he instigated the conflict and pulled the trigger when it escalated he was justified in killing Martin in the micro level case of self defense but he s also guilty of murder because he started the conflict 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Zimmerman started the engagement he can t escalate it to lethal levels if the situation turns sour   The trigger isn t justified solely because Martin was bashing Zimmerman s head into the pavement 
PoliticalDiscussion,No   As I ve said repeatedly over the past few days   if you follow me around at night and pursue me and I can t determine why  like you yelling out  hey buddy you dropped your towel    I m not going to let you catch me to find out You don t have to initiate contact   I will drop you before you get a chance    Don t want none don t start none    You don t pursue strangers in the street at night Zimmerman is lucky Martin didn t have a gun because he d been shot    My opinion before was that Zimmerman was at fault for Martin s death My opinion remains that Zimmerman was at fault for Martin s death 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why is this a competition  I try to align myself to the Hegelian principal of argument  Thesis anti thesis synthesis  r politics is thesis crush THESIS 
PoliticalDiscussion,You I like the cut of your jib Thinking from the point of view of  if I were Zimmerman and knowing that feeling of responsibility that supposed to come with having a concealed weapon for self defense   The  transcript does not read like the musing of a confident competent gun owner At all  These assholes always get away  That s the point when one crosses over from responsible gun owner to ruining it for the rest of us They are supposed to get away That s the point   The hypocrisy of this case is what burns me Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law Protect yourself only under imminent threat Instead Zimmerman shoots some kid in the street who he thought was guilty of something without any evidence Now all of a sudden we should treat Zimmerman as innocent until proven guilty What about Trayvon huh What about the goddamn golden rule 
PoliticalDiscussion,We do have some major collusion though  Here are the conditions for a perfect market  First there must be many firms in the market none of which is large in terms of its sales Second firms should be able to enter and exit the market easily Third each firm in the market produces and sells a nondifferentiated or homogeneous product Fourth all firms and consumers in the market have complete information about prices product quality and production techniques     We would be hard pressed to find industries or consumers who totally fit all four conditions to a high degree 
PoliticalDiscussion,Also an empty plastic bag is grounds for suspension now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Youre right whats to stop other countries from making nuclear weapons and using them against other countries  Well in my opinion its kinda like peer pressure  The nations that have signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty   are some of the larger and more economically important countries in the world so they can put pressure on nations who are trying to build nuclear weapons This pressure can come in many different forms military economic and so forth As you have brought up Iran the EU took  steps to try and economically pressure   Iran into slowing their nuclear program Granted why the EU can do this is because of where they get their oil and how dependent on Iranian oil they are Some of the countries in the EU such as Greece are more dependent on oil than Britain Germany the bigger countries so this kind of embargo would hurt them more than the later  But I guess this still doesnt get to the question of how the treaty directly makes the world safer I dont think it does have that much of a direct impact other than serving as a mission statement for the countries that have signed it saying to the rest of the world  hey look we  a large portion of the world want things to be this way and you should join us because its the most mutually beneficial thing to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here s the thing  Zimmerman argues that he did nothing wrong because the Stand Your Ground Law allows him to protect himself when he feels threatened  The police tapes show that he was instructed not to follow Martin by the  responder An order he disobeyed  Now if Zimmerman  was in fact following Martin then Martin is also protected by the Stand Your Ground Law because he was only defending himself because he felt threatened  EDIT there s a misunderstanding with what point I m trying to make here Basically he felt threatened so he wanted to defend himself You cannot use that as a valid defense because Treyvon Martin quite possibly also felt threatened I m not saying anything about him disobeying an order I m saying they were  both using the Stand Your Ground law as a defense and because Zimmerman took action first he is the aggressor  Those are the facts Now based on that I personally conclude that since Zimmerman made the first step toward confrontation then he is the aggressor therefore he is to blame 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh I think Zimmerman should be nailed to the wall  not literally  but the cops barely did any kind of testing by their own admission and we don t have any of the clothes Zimmerman was wearing no drug tests were done  oh yeah except on the corpse  as far as I know they didn t keep much as evidence etc     For a manslaughter investigation which this should have been treated as next to nothing was done to preserve actual forensic evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  call recording depicts Zimmerman chasing him Trayvon tried to avoid confrontation AFAIAC anything Trayvon may have done after that was his own self defense If I was being chased by this guy at night Zimmerman would have found himself looking down the sights the other way 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve heard the argument that with  stand your ground  in rush hour traffic when someone cuts you off in a threatening manner you can pull your registered firearm and shoot at them from your car Is that true Because that d be fucked up 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I remained calm I would probably run If I panicked and fight or flight kicked in I m just as likely to fight What if your pursuer had a gun drawn Do you run and get shot in the back or do you fight for your life 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t care whether or not Martin was beating the crap out of Zimmerman It is not in dispute that Zimmerman targeted Martin and chased him down for no good reason IMO that makes Zimmerman wholly responsible for the result If Zimmerman had me in his sights in the same manner it s quite possible I d have beat the crap out of him too 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt if your legal actions lead you into a situation  Harassing someone or threatening them to get them to attack you so you can shoot them is not legal  Just as guns don t commit crimes lack of restrictive laws don t cause crimes If that s the case then the reason we have so many people in prison in this country is because we don t have enough laws Drug abuse is the result of lax laws as is being gay etc     Otherwise I m in total agreement with you It s not about duty to retreat it s about duty not to be aggressive and harassing to someone else to cause them the need to defend themselves  In any confrontation it takes aggression to start violence the aggressor is the guilty one 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah  I think that what the police did in this case was legal but I don t think that it  should be legal I think that if you kill someone you should stand trial and be forced to prove that you were acting in self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,If I had to guess based on what I ve seen so far  note pure speculation warning this is why we have trials   Zimmerman forced a confrontation by following this kid who was trying to get away   When Zimmerman wouldn t leave the kid alone Martin tried to defend himself and Zimmerman getting the worst of it shot him  It doesn t appear to be murder but there should be  some charge for chasing this kid down and forcing a confrontation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Decriminalizing drugs
PoliticalDiscussion,Pretty sure the race issue really started with and is fueled by  this part   t s of his  call 
PoliticalDiscussion,I did not vote in  here s why in order of importance to me   No candidate in my local elections fit my personal views  I live in Washington DC so if I vote I am automatically selected for Jury duty within the next two years  Not mandated by law or anything but we have a high crime rate and relatively low voter turnout here so anyone who votes has a very good chance of getting selected for jury duty  I also have no national representation in my city so that s another disincentive  If I lived anywhere else  say I move to suburban Washington in either Maryland or Virginia I would vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is amazing that one thing has not come to light yet  How far was Zimmerman from TM when TM was shot  Ballistic folks can tell if Martin was shot at point blank range as this new evidence would suggest or over a distance 
PoliticalDiscussion,Apparently it s also a place for the insecure to attempt to make themselves feel superior to the rest 
PoliticalDiscussion,No considering that zimmerman initiated the confrontation with someone he was so convinced was dangerous that he called  If i am sufficiently intimidated or threatened by a person to call  im damn sure not gonna give chase when the police are on their way   The way I see it he was planning on a confrontation and called  part out of apparent habit and part to give himself a reasonable excuse for using his gun should it come to that He most likely approached martin in an inappropriately aggressive manner My guess is he laid hands on martin maybe to keep him still for the cops or just get his attention and got attacked   I find it very difficult to believe martin would attack zimmerman a much older and bigger guy without zimmerman having put hands on him He was a high school kid they wont even swing on eachother until the talking stops and the pushing starts It just seems unreasonable to think martin would just attack this guy for walking up and asking questions   Im of the opinion that a paranoid man s hero complex got the better of him that day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Legislators write laws executives administer laws and write regulations  and to a limited extent enforce them  and courts interpret and enforce laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not aware of any state that applies the duty to retreat to within one s household Some don t apply it to one s property in general  including personal property e g one s car  
PoliticalDiscussion,Education is really complex and so blanket legislation to meaningfully affect it is very hard to create Despite that here are a few things I believe would help   create different standards for success The MCAS is okay but we can t just rely on the MCAS and our current metrics to determine success   overhaul our teaching methods One teacher standing in front of a classroom of  kids teaching one subject for  minutes per day is just a  bad model The  naturals in a given subject will succeed but many kids who are having problems will get left behind   remedial programs for kids who lag behind Summer school is largely a joke Students who lag behind in academics should be given after school and weekend tutors until they are caught up with the rest of the class   learning currently occurs in the classroom whereas practice occurs outside of it when the teacher isn t available to help This desperately needs to be switched especially given new and effective technology for learning  computers the internet    involve students in classroom learning and practices Proficient students should spend some time helping less proficient students   overhaul the incentive structure for teachers and school admins Right now the incentive is not to get in trouble with the government   so you cheat you lie and you re stuck on the defensive Instead we need to give schools the incentive to actually help students learn   create incentives for students to learn Unfortunately the thought of getting a good education is not often compelling to teens Anything you can do to provide additional incentives can t hurt   parental involvement We need parents to get involved with their kids education and hold both their kids and school administrations accountable for providing a good education 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Umm it absolutely is inherent to government  No No no no It is entirely possible for government organizations to efficiently purchase I gave you several examples already   gt Even worse you are admitting the government is corrupt  Yes   gt So how on earth do you think that giving the same government that is already demonstrably corrupt MORE POWER is going to make things better I will never understand how people can simultaneously believe that the government is bought and paid for and that we should give it more money and let it make more decisions  Because corruption is not unfixable and  theoretically government is primarily accountable to the citizenry not shareholders We haven t always had the level of corruption we have now  Besides it s not as if private corporations are also immune from corruption and graft Happens all the time

PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure what else you I can do when a guy named  I am John Galt starts complaining about the tax man  Sure it s great to fantasize about defending your castle against  men with guns come to enforce immoral taxes but in real life it plays out more like  this    Since we live in different universes what s the point of arguing 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry I missed what you re calling  evidence here Both sides have witnesses saying the other guy started it One witness says she could hear crying and cries for help then a gunshot then silence  I have never seen heard anyone just shut off crying unless they were shot And your link below responding to hmunkey has no evidence of the treatment it just says the cops said he had these and they were so insignificant that they didn t take him to a hospital Zimmerman went himself the next day   Also Zimmerman is recorded in the  call saying he was following Martin Right now it s he said vs he s dead so I don t think it s shocking that the victim is getting smeared here Start producing witnesses saying how Zimmerman wasn t profiling Martin or how he is a level headed calm man  that ll sell me more than pointing out the victim was tall and was suspended under zero tolerance regulations Honestly I don t care if Martin murdered hundreds of people a day  unless Zimmerman can produce some reason for why he was stalking Martin why he felt the need to confront him and do so while carrying a loaded gun I blame him for this   And I would think that everyone seeing this whole issue would like to see some change in treatment for the  Stand Your Ground policies for law enforcement This wouldn t be a national story if the responding police would have booked Zimmerman for  hours at least collected physical evidence done basic forensic tests  for instance distance of gun from bullet wound would be great to know  Instead they let this guy go home and do whatever he wanted Without any photos of the victim defendant when police showed up at the scene how can you prove he didn t go home and give himself those lacerations and bloody nose   And no Zimmerman shouldn t be able to invoke self defense in this case If you go into a biker bar scream  only cock suckers ride Harleys and you instigate the fight you saying you were justified to shoot someone beating you is bull When person A creates the situation he is libel for it I view it the same as fraying my brake lines down to the point they are almost broken then driving around town  you don t get to sue the manufacturer because of your actions 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is this hypocrisy He basically said that he would like to do one thing but as said thing would be difficult to do in an election year he will do another Why are you surprised that Obama would take his preferred path after the election is over when it isn t politically salient  I dont see how or why you are connecting this to a gaffe some campaign manager made One was an absurd statement that made someone look foolish the other was a statement of political realities 
PoliticalDiscussion,In response to OP s mention of the Khan Academy    Khan Academy is fucking  magic  I ve learned more in  months of watching KA videos and doing the KA s online practices than I learned in  years of high school math  If I had Khan Academy when I was still in school I probably would have grown up to be an engineer 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it is the free market If you look at it wrong you may get confused but that does not mean that the free market is not working as intended squeezing every drop of waste out of the system to make it the most competitive 
PoliticalDiscussion,We are still missing alot of details in this case whos to say that martin wasn t in fear of his life when zimmerman confronted him how do we know that zimmerman didn t provoke martin it goes the other way to we don t know if martin started the fight do we 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sarcastic reply with no point Aww yeah upvote  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There are only so many times you can reply to something like  taxes are violence before you realize your just tossing trollfood  Because it s untrue or because you just don t like hearing it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote because by not doing so im essentially handing the reins of the country to the easily swayed morons and stubborn old people who turn up to vote every year  Plus if you dont vote you really dont have any right to complain about anything concerning our policies or elected officials 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Martin was the first to use physical violence then it was justified killing in self defense Maybe Zimmerman should have not followed him but that does not mean he has no right to defend himself if Martin indeed attacked   first   Being followed is not enough of a threat to justify physically attacking someone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you please provide sources indicating conservatives have been advocating an individual mandate for over  years   That seems like a pretty bold claim to state while providing zero supporting evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s rarely a wise move 
PoliticalDiscussion,Makes legitimate point Downvoted 
PoliticalDiscussion,blank is not a vote so it wouldn t be counted 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we accept the scenario as you put it then no he didn t Unless he shot him while being bashed If he was able to get up and shoot him then the threat was alread over I personally think Zimmerman tried to physically restrain Martin and in turn got his ass kicked which made him over react But that s my own speculation not based on any known facts Zimmerman just seems liagooubleahoot of those guys who was looking for trouble Keep in mind I m a gun lover and owner so I m not just talking shit because he had a gun I believe we all should have the right to defend ourselves but only where there is a true threat 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it does not change my opinion It is not about who attacked whom It is about listening to the police instead of going out with a gun trying to do their jobs It is about applying the law uniformly regardless of race gender age or status It is about how I never hear about any shooter at least being arrested If he acted in self defense then let the courts figure it out like they usually do 
PoliticalDiscussion,The law might or might not apply I don t know if it does I said  if the law applies I would consider it unjust The senator however even though he authored the bill does not get to interpret it  i don t think  
PoliticalDiscussion,Eyewitness identification of a stranger is shit I d agree and  discount that But I d give some weight to actions that were witnessed Not  weight but maybe   
PoliticalDiscussion,But that doesn t matter because Trayvon was freaked out by this  lbs man tailing and then chasing him How would you feel if noticed a car tailing you and then a guy much larger than you gets out and starts pursuing you Zimmerman initiated the confrontation 
PoliticalDiscussion,It sounds to me like a shithead  or perhaps just paranoid dude looking for trouble found trouble and was able to legally kill someone   It sounds like Florida needs to clarify their laws     
PoliticalDiscussion,From the article   gt Zimmerman told police that Trayvon Martin knocked him down with a single punch and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times before the shooting  an account that police said witnesses have corroborated 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You also have to consider Trayvon was recently suspended from school for posession of marijuna  No No you don t 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well that s an assumption you are making and one you cannot prove    gt people who say martin shouldnt have fought back   Except legally isn t that the defining factor 
PoliticalDiscussion,A It was suburban Orlando    B Why does being in the South matter Are people in Michigan California or Boston more enlightened in their racism 
PoliticalDiscussion,No because he s black 
PoliticalDiscussion,A  dispatcher   B Not strict orders  We don t need you to do that  
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically didn t the legal system already do its job 
PoliticalDiscussion,The stand your ground law and others like it encourage vigilantism and the issue with focusing so heavily on making this a one dimensional Zimmerman runs after and then immediately guns down Trayvon situation based solely on the color of his skin and hoodie of course instead of criticizing the law means that whenever a detail like this comes out it is perceived by some as that much more damning to the family s claim    So what happens if and when other things come out  Already there s this marijuana suspension with Trayvon being bandied about as an indication of the young man s character as if it means he was some sort of violent criminal as a result of that  What if he had a Facebook profile where he expressed anger about whites or hispanics    The fact of the matter is that this law enables people to use myriad justifications for operating completely on their own with apparently little physical evidence required to avoid being arrested or even taken in for questioning  The fact he may have acted in this particular situation is not trivial however who s to say there s other situations the law could be abused because someone can simply say they felt their life was in danger and therefore they needed to gun someone else down  Easily abused and widely interpret able laws reinforce a paradigm which due to the society in which they re being enforced exhibits systemic racism sexism ageism and other  bias  If this guy acted out of racial animosity or prejudice that s likely to come out based off things he s done or said in the past  But that s going to be harder to be clear to the public because of the realities of the situation which is far from one dimensional 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you define personal attack Couldnt you calling him a puritan be considered a personal attack 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt who is equally benefitting from casual sex MEN  Ok men equally benefit from casual sex   I dont get it Whats your point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which is why the question was  what do you think would cause it   Not necessarily   will it happen today   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt None of those things would start a revolution except the executive branch rounding up people to concentration camps Of course that s an idiotic proposition and it s not gonna happen  It s happened before   This nation has rounded up Japanese before and experimented with Eugenics   gt High gas prices like at  would cause the current politicians to lose office and a true oil war to start Iraq wasn t an oil war   we got nothing out of it A real oil war would be brutal and exploitative but it would also be trivially easy for the US  Trivially easy for the US to win but think of the economic impact of high gas prices combined with war that would further destabilize fuel prices and increase inflation as the gov t debts it up  While these alone may not cause revolution they lay the groundwork for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a decision to be made between an employer and an employee 
PoliticalDiscussion,But the fine is cheaper than having health insurance whereas using health insurance as a tax write off would exclude that taxable income spent on HI and lead to a larger refund   and single payer can only work if it was a public option and there were no interstate barriers to competition  Otherwise the game is rigged in the Gov ts favor 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt it comes out cheaper  Thats why they do it If it didnt come out cheaper it would be charity People dont have a moral obligation to engage in charity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because I can 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Republican FL state senator who co authored the law agrees with you and has said that it would not apply to this situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Zimmerman was following him  and that is not in dispute  which means Zimmerman sought the confrontation  also not in dispute  Since Martin was doing nothing wrong and was not actually acting suspiciously  being black is not a suspicious behavior prior to the altercation those two facts place Zimmerman clearly in the wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just like trashing the evidence from   Police realize how vital evidence is and many  lose or never collect relevant evidence If it suits their whim or wallet 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Zimmerman was attacked  why was he attacked Did he walk up on Martin Did he threaten him Was he confronted Did he attack or threaten Martin first Why did he follow him It was outside was there time to call for help to call the cops was there a possibility to just walk away and avoid any confrontation  There is simply to much we don t know for sure There is speculation all over but hardly any facts except that one man shot another man one man had a deadly weapon the other man was unarmed In any case the decision is not one the public has to make but a judge and a jury on basis of evidence  In any case a brawl or a punch should not lead to deadly force Where would it lead if any confrontation could possibly end up in a lethal shootout with no consequences Is it likely that out in the open there was no way for any of the involved persons to avoid confrontation and just walk away   Human life in any case outweighs anything Bruises can heal broken limbs can heal stolen goods can be replaced But you can not bring anybody back from the dead Sadly in this case one life is lost forever another one possibly destroyed Nobody won nobody was saved 
PoliticalDiscussion,zimmerman was prepared to kill martin the second he stepped out of his car with a loaded gun people who say martin shouldnt have fought back or worn this or that or been tall or young or in that neighborhood are blaming the victim and doing it with a fairly transparent bias 
PoliticalDiscussion,It may not be r politics but it s still reddit But if the entire internet doesnt crush everything remotely non left then how will they be able to stand up against that one cable news network

PoliticalDiscussion,Well the whole Arab Spring kind of changed how people view the conflict in Libya If Saddam was still around his people would have surely revolted and Saddam would have probably used chemical weapons on them again and if we gave Saddam the boot under those circumstances whichever president did it might have been hailed as a hero 
PoliticalDiscussion,    It should be left up to the state s I personally find it rather useless I think mandatory prison labor would be way more beneficial to society Though if we brought back roman coliseum and had gladiators FUCK YES BRING IT BACK 
PoliticalDiscussion,I still wonder what Obama did with that Nobel peace prize I wonder how it feels to be the only person on the planet who has won that prize and also sent troops to war Sigh I ll still probably end up voting for him because all of the republican candidates right now are insane 
PoliticalDiscussion, I don t vote because every single politician is gonna sell out in office I also don t think any of them have respectable policies 
PoliticalDiscussion, My beliefs have not changed I believe  who gives a fuck  Cases like this happen all the time The media just focuses on this stuff to make it about race to divide people That s why revolutions don t occur too often The people who started the american or french revolutions weren t worried about race or sex or culture They wanted something to eat and a stable economy and democracy And until we stop talking about useless crap and have a straight message the revolution will not happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman didn t just follow Martin He followed him  in direct contravention of a police dispatcher  possibly with a racial motive 
PoliticalDiscussion,reddit isn t liberal If anything it s libertarian 
PoliticalDiscussion,It would still be Zimmerman s fault He got out of his car followed Martin  after receiving orders from a police dispatcher not to do so  and accosted him for looking  suspicious  The fact that his actions may have been racially motivated only exacerbates the issue and make Zimmerman look like he hunted down and shot a black teen because he could 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman s story is that he lost sight of Martin and was walking back to his SUV Martin walked up to him and confronted him and then it turned violent If this is the case then all of you people claiming Zimmerman initiated are wrong because he was leaving yes he followed Martin but if he was leaving Martin should not have confronted him  Also if Zimmerman had not shot Martin Martin would be charged with assault I mean come on a reasonable person does not proceed to try to kick the shit out of someone without being threatened  all of you who said Zimmerman threatened Martin with a gun have no evidence for this at all    Honestly I believe both parties are at fault and Reddit is trying damn hard to make it black and white  literally when it s really all just grey Reddit has a large proportion of left leaning individuals  if  r politics  r politics is any indication and of course they are going to jump all over a white guy shooting a black guy for suspicious behaviour It has gun control racism and stand your ground laws as the main issues at play so Redditors are still going to try to keep it black and white because it can help them try to prove a point about political issues 
PoliticalDiscussion,Regardless of the volatility of any situation the police have a job to do Zimmerman has the same rights to due process as any other US Citizen     By releasing evidence that either convicts or exonerates Zimmerman in the court of public opinion neither he nor Martin receives a fair trial    As much as it sucks to let the process work  cause dammit we re mad for now  it needs to be allowed to work  
PoliticalDiscussion,Unless you re the one being attacked you don t get to say what s life threatening or not    I m not supporting Zimmerman here but if I m being attacked by someone I don t know I m not going to think  meh he ll just beat me until he s tired and then give up  
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a few Democrat family members They generally will say things are  concerning about some things that Obama has done but they d never call him a war criminal I think that s what you re referring to 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hear what you re saying But   and  is not a lightweight It s skin and bones That s about  or  pounds more than a  runway model would be expected to weigh 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Even with a mandate you still have an opting out problem and you re still subsidizing a private market which is already inefficient enough  Which further makes the mandate confusing  It s essentially useless  Using a tax based system would at least off set costs for middle class folks and provide an incentive for health insurance  The fine based system does nothing to ensure compliance but is sure as hell unconstitutional  at least I hope SCOTUS agrees  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t know of any which is why this one was a big deal  Big deal I haven t heard this story anywhere on the radio or on nightly news   Really just on the internet And even then as we see in this thread the majority of responses  from Obama minded supporters is  THIS IS NO BIG DEAL   Do you think the same would be said if Bush made these comments Or do you think it would be used as an example of Bush s inept leadership 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your first link is a good summary of the situation but I fail to see how it justifies what it calls  at least  months with the United States being at best reactive and at worst non responsive to events   In fact if anything it only re afirms my disgust with those who prefer to count votes over leading the country  Your second link while it is informative also does not speak to the topic of the thread This isn t about the missiles it is about what was intended to be said to the public  one thing and what was intended to be private  Another thing we only know of because of the open mic   by the way I don t believe it was Obama s fault the mic was open In fact not all sound board operators are democrats gnome sane   For the article to state  Russia and the United States Pushing Tensions to the Limit  Seems quite a bit of hyperbole especially considering the past between the two nations  I m curious Do you work for Stratfor or do you just like all their pressers   
PoliticalDiscussion,I completely agree  There should absolutely be some justifiable reason for self defense in order to claim it  From there the burden of proof lies on the state to prove there was no justifiable reason  I specifically refrained from commenting on the case in question  In my opinion  given the information available there is no justifiable claim in this specific instance  Zimmerman instigated the conflict when he pursued and confronted Martin  Prior to this Zimmerman was in no immediate danger and was not being threatened therefor Stand Your Ground does not apply Self defense cannot be used in defending the aggressor  If Stand Your Ground applies in anyway to this case it should be used in Martins defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is actually a very large contribution to the rise in healthcare costs People just do whatever procedures the doctor suggests without even asking why A doctor says  I d like to do  x procedure and most patients don t even think about it and just get it done even though it may not be medically necessary Then they re shocked when they see the insurance won t cover the procedure because they never needed it in the first place

PoliticalDiscussion,   gt I think that we as a community  being every intelligent person on earth needs to be more involved and concerned about the safety and well being of our neighbors More concerned in general about people Fights on the subways being filmed by  broken up by none That shit needs to stop it sure as shit will not fly if I m present  lt  I agree we do need to stand up and be concerned about each other however in this case there was no real cause for the level of concern Zimmerman exerted None at all other then his baseless conclusion about who Trayvon was a criminal and why he was walking in the subdivision  to commit a crime We can be suspicious and fearful   but when it is baseless it is paranoia projection or something equally unjust    
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like we could just stop doing so many unnecessary procedures rather than trying to end around the problem by making the procedures cheaper 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sorry I wasn t asking for more examples of your political perspective   I was asking for more examples of world leaders who unexpectedly speaking into a live mic reveal to a counterpart that they are going to act tough on         before the election but give the counterpart what they want  after the election  I ask for the example because I am hard pressed to think of one I also doubt that it would be played off as  Wise Politics if there is such a comparable example  I ll go read your links now 
PoliticalDiscussion,I thought there was a Stand Your Ground law   Doesn t that law work for Trayvon too   someone being followed by an armed brown person has the right to defend themselves 
PoliticalDiscussion,OP is a moron 
PoliticalDiscussion,Upvote AGAIN How is it that people are missing the point that this kid being stalked by some guy at night was obviously feeling threatened as well If he did in fact assault Zimmerman it was self defense on HIS part The story would be totally different if they were both armed but that wasn t the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,Posted a link elsewhere on here but you re going to have to find it on your own in this post or google it yourself Too tough to link sources from while using my phone 
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote third party because the other two parties can eat my ass 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why wasn t this said in the first fucking place Odd how this witness comes out of no where as well as supposed evidence that he was being attacked Never mind the fact he was stalking a child around despite  people telling him not to continue   How did he even get into the position to be beaten up in such a manner Why did he confront this man child   Look at it from Martin s perspective you have some suspicious car following you for blocks You re just trying to get back home with whatever snacks you have for yourself and your younger brother You re being trailed you re black in a high end neighborhood I d feel threatened on THAT side of the story before being threatened as Zimmerman supposedly is 
PoliticalDiscussion,Independent peoples republic of Nebraska   Fuck yeah lol I can see it now Warren buffett as dictator for life Lol       
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Not to get too far off topic  I ll pause while you excuse the  Non war doctrine and the unconstitutional war in Libya   Sure Which was the humanitarian aid part Was it the  bombing runs Or perhaps the missiles fired from the subs in the gulf The drone attacks The Missile Launchers and Anti Aircraft guns we dropped in for the untrained and uncountable civilians to bolt to the back of their Toyotas Was it the  dead in  months Was it the way we picked up and left as soon as Gadaffi was assassinated  Our Drone missed him by  that much   Which part are you so proud of The way it looks like Mad Max there today      gt Calling Libya an abuse of power is either a joke or a willful denial of the political reality behind the situation  Huh 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like a lot of what the Libertarian Party has to say though there are some elements that I cannot support dismantling the Federal Government for instance 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But the fine is cheaper than having health insurance  I never said it wasn t   Using the income spent on insurance premiums as a write off would not result in a refund large enough to offset the enormous costs of insurance Deductions are not credits they do not result in a  for  return The net affect would be that people are still paying a positive amount of money for a service they previously did not receive because they either opted out of or could not gain access Even with a mandate you still have an opting out problem and you re still subsidizing a private market which is already inefficient enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,That almost sounds more libertariab thab republican
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Assuming all of this evidence turns out to be true   CLAIMS are true or false  Evidence is just evidence  Why do you keep confusing the two  Who are you spinning for 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I prefer the kind of diplomacy that doesn t hinge on re election   and I also prefer diplomacy from a presidential candidate that is the same before the election as it is after the election Call me crazy but I m into the whole continuity and honesty thing  Join the real world and stop pretending this is a partisan thing Every sitting president hedges all their decisions depending on what they need to do to win re election It has nothing to do with party affiliation If you want to attack Obama for being pragmatic about what he can realistically say and do before and after the election fine but just realize that it s not specific to Obama all presidents do it   Criticize it as an unfortunate aspect of election centric politics don t make it out to be some personal failing Obama has or you re just going to come off as hopelessly partisan  Stop with the faux  I m just looking for some  honesty   idealism and pretending this isn t something you could accuse every president who s ever sought re election of

PoliticalDiscussion,no  he says that he wants room on the issue That s his exact words Look if I had a tough time at work and you were a coworker hounding me on a separate issue then I might say  listen Gnome I need a little space right now I have a lot going on but after sept my project finishes and we can tackle this issue  Thats what he is saying   its not an issue change at all I am no Obama apologist I hate all politicians equally 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m also not going to spend my evening playing cops and robbers It s not a matter of  good luck catching me it s a matter of  I m not going to waste my time trying to evade some creeper when I can settle this right now  
PoliticalDiscussion,Lacerations could have occurred by being hit with one punch and hitting his head on the ground 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll give you that  I cannot imagine it being that clear cut at the scene to not at least take Zimmerman into custody for some amount of time 
PoliticalDiscussion,The outrage came in that the legal system didn t even bother to look into the case Add that to the previous shoddy police work by Sanford police police correcting witnesses and a kid being dead there should be some outrage  Should it have gone to trial Maybe not Should it have at least gone to grand jury so all the evidence comes out yes They severely botched the initial investigation which reduced their credibility to nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not a lawyer just opinion  But I think the burden of proof should be at least shared somewhat  The shooter needs to be able to show reasonable evidence that he acted in self defense  The majority of the burden of proof should lie with the state but there should be something that prevents every shooter from claiming self defense   Personally I think Zimmerman should be charged with manslaughter or some such because he instigated and created the scenario that resulted in Martin s death  In the moment if Martin was wailing on him I cannot fault him for shooting  I can fault him for putting himself in that position though  I won t even begin to say whether I think he is guilty or not because I cannot know all of the evidence however  That s for judge and jury 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess I should speak for myself But then again I would never be in this position I come from a neighbor that is predominately black so I m used to seeing people walking around at two or three in the morning 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not to get too far off topic but you really have to be cloyingly naive to believe that the congressional stir over the war effort in Tripoli was anything but political posturing from a Republican House of Reps that was already dedicated to opposing Obama at any turn  Whether there were any compelling moral fiscal or geopolitical reasons to oppose it is essentially irrelevant none of those are the reasons the Republicans bitched about it They wanted to continue obstructing Obama over a military action that cost us virtually nothing compared to Iraq Afghanistan and had infinitely more tangible results in a tiny fraction of the time  Calling Libya an abuse of power is either a joke or a willful denial of the political reality behind the situation 
PoliticalDiscussion,He  is saying he will change his stance He says  exactly that He says he will be rigid  before the election and then flexible in a way that is pleasing to Medvedev and Putin  after the election  The change in stance could not be more obvious 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt President Obama This is my last election After my election I have more flexibility  I agree he didn t say the words  I m going to lie to my citizens    although I would expect the possessive ownership from Obama     He most certainly implied he would be rigid before the elections and flexible after For some reason you insist this is not a change of positions   which I find odd It s an obvious change You can excuse it as you do   but that does not make it something respectable  This is an act Obama is promising to put on before elections and it is for the benefit of  his citizens and more directly His votes Obama makes it very clear that it will be an act  before the election and he ll show his true colors in a way that is more pleasing to Medeved and Putin  after the election  You can insist this is no big deal  and many an Obama supporter will agree with you Good luck with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh my how offensive that was I am so sorry  LOL
PoliticalDiscussion,The burden of proof is still left to the state  By pleading self defense the state no longer has to prove that you killed somebody  you admitted to that  but they do have to prove that you were not acting in self defense when you killed somebody  The person I was replying to said that the burden of proof should be on the defendant that they should have to prove they were acting in self defense I disagree with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Instead he gets to go to atheist hell 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would do the same as Zimmerman and I would do the same as Martin If you followed me I would assault you You would likely kick my ass though   but the point remains I would try to punch you in the face for pursuing me through a neighborhood at night   whether it ends with me beating the shit out of you you beating the shit out of me or you shooting me  or me shooting you is beside the point You following me is the prime mover in the series of events
PoliticalDiscussion,Yea I wouldn t have either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thoughts are good  Stream of consciousness is bad 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it was right for Zimmerman to shoot martin   But I think that Zimmerman brought this on himself by following him    While it was right for Zimmerman to shoot martin martin was not wrong for attacking zimmerman Zimmerman thus should be charged with something less than premeditated murder Manslaughter or whatever  I don t know what all the degrees of murder mean     If Zimmerman was justified in shooting martin martin was justified in fighting zimmerman   All of it though falls back on Zimmerman He is  responsible for everything that happened because it could all have NOT happened if he did not pursue Martin 
PoliticalDiscussion, responder is part of the police department so basically he was instructed by the police to leave martin alone  zimmerman choose to be an aggressor he actions put the chain of events in progress that resulted in a needless death 
PoliticalDiscussion,President Obama On all these issues but particularly missile defense this this can be solved but it s important for him to give me space   President Medvedev Yeah I understand I understand your message about space Space for you   President Obama This is my last election After my election I have more flexibility   President Medvedev I understand I will transmit this information to Vladimir     That s the quote He said it can be solved Just not now Suggested that after the election is better The Russian agreed No conspiracy No  I m going to lie to my citizens  No  I m going to tell Congress one thing and fuck them over after I win  Just  We can do this Later is better    If you want to interpret that another way feel free It won t make your trolling any more accurate and it won t lend your argument any additional credibility 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unless you re using an affirmative defense    In a self defense shooting you admit to the crime but present extenuating circumstances that show you shouldn t be punished 
PoliticalDiscussion,The legal system  cops and prosecutors declined to prosecute Zimmerman based on their evidence  Therefore the legal system did its job You  and I may not agree with it but not everyone gets dragged before a judge jury 
PoliticalDiscussion,Seriously  If I were Zimmerman and had an inkling of a sense of self preservation I d consider not approaching the   football player  that I already assumed was suspicious   But it s clear that his gun made him feel like the big man   Starting a fight because you think you re invincible should perhaps negate any claims to self defense  Edit I m saying this since it is understandable and totally expected that confronting a large man may put one in the way of physical harm because confrontation leads to a flight or fight response almost necessarily 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If one more individual got involved I feel confident that all parties would have walked away from that encounter   gt You want to talk about a golden rule How about take responsibility for  justice each and every one of us All these videos recently of people getting beaten up or robbed while several people stand around and film really frustrate me This is the world we have allowed to happen if you dont like it make a stand help your neighbor support strangers in need and stop injustice wherever you see it I don t see why thats so hard for some people to grasp  I agree There s some amount of social psychological evidence as to why people don t get involved Like the Bystander effect

PoliticalDiscussion,This has created an interesting problem for me as I try to consider this all  It s sort of a unique situation that doesn t come up all the time  but the idea seem to be hitting me more frequently as I visit Reddit  It s amazing how the Internet has changed the world and how we look at it  I m left to consider the  chicken and egg aspect of this all  Is an idea a joke because the person advancing it is a joke  or does the person become a joke because of the ideas that they advance 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Zimmerman is lucky Martin didn t have a gun because he d been shot  So in your mind it s justifiable for Martin to shoot Zimmerman for  following him at night and yet not right for Zimmerman to shoot Martin after he broke his nose and bashed his head into the pavement multiple times  This is odd I d like you to explain this more as I m fairly confused on your logic here 
PoliticalDiscussion,You didn t bring anything to the conversation Nobody asked you to moderate   If you want to just express your frustration this is the place to do it   Sound familiar If Halaku wants to bitch about Fox News this is apparently the place for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very sad  I hope we can all remember this while we discuss the details of the case as they come out  We are all upset by the way this went down so the best we can do is remain civil and try and stick to the details and help enlighten others who might not know the full story 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  I m going to tell my people X and then tell them Y in December   What he said was I am going to be rigid before the elections and flexible after the elections   SO yes he did 
PoliticalDiscussion,No If you are the neighborhood watch you observe and report If you see  someone suspicious you call the cops and go home You don t confront anyone You certainly don t follow them around in your car   and then to get out of your car and pursue them You are BEGGING for a problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s because there s no such thing as a natural right to work and health  They are contrived  rights that carry no weight if they re infringed upon 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Instead Zimmerman shoots some kid in the street who he thought was guilty of something without any evidence   That came out first obviously that is the main story here but as the details keep coming out it s starting to become much more complicated than some MAN shooting some KID for no reason  This   id seems to have been a much bigger threat than we were all lead to believe  I still think that the biggest problem with this whole case is all the pathetic assholes who called  but didn t step foot outside and try and help either party involved  If one more individual got involved I feel confident that all parties would have walked away from that encounter  You want to talk about a golden rule  How about take responsibility for justice each and every one of us  All these videos recently of people getting beaten up or robbed while several people stand around and film really frustrate me  This is the world we have allowed to happen if you dont like it make a stand help your neighbor support strangers in need and stop injustice wherever you see it  I don t see why thats so hard for some people to grasp 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Huh I honestly don t understand what s so funny about what I said  I guess it is your expectation of dishonesty that made me laugh at first    I also lament such a sad outlook on life and the world   gt Yeah like you and everyone else I would prefer absolute honesty from our politicians but that isn t ever going to happen  I think there is a difference between reasonable and unreasonable expectations I think it is reasonable to expect a president to  not wisper  I promise I ll be better after elections to the leader of Russia like some  year old girl on the side in high school   gt The same logic applies in every country for every ideology  I d love to see other similar examples if you have them

PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives were in favor of cap and trade until they saw how it worked in Europe  Turns out that when their best and brightest put out policy proposals they re sometimes just guessing what will work based on the advice of experts and common ideas of the state of the field at that moment  Sometimes they choose second best options based on what s politically viable  Sometimes they choose second best options because they like how it will force the debate on issues that aren t really at the state of policy  Sometimes they choose second best solutions because they are just wrongly thinking they re first best   In the intervening  years there s been a very long time to spend exploring these various ideas and becoming better experts on issues that would grow in importance  Take this  point   by Julian Sanchez on how the thinking about these issues has improved   gt I don t mean to pick on this particular article but I think it s telling that the cover story about the  Clinton health care plan in Reason which if anything has been ahead of the general trend I m talking about was a  thumbsucker by philosopher David Kelley on the importance of the distinction between positive and negative rights   a piece with more than a whiff of the armchair about it Make no mistake I m the last person on earth to deride the deployment of philosophy in policy disputes One thing Keynes got dead right was that soi disant pragmatists who relegate such considerations to the ivory tower are invariably the ones most in the grips of some  academic scribbler s theory usually bad theory for being held unreflectively But let s be frank This is not exactly a scintillating deployment of Kelley s full philosophical powers  which are ample most philosogeeks would happily throw a fat man under a runaway trolley for his pedigree  It would not be apt to persuade an educated person who doesn t already share share his priors Rather it proceeds to lay out a case without apparent concern for the rather obvious responses a reasonable defender of a  right to healthcare would be likely to offer at each step because it aims primarily at an audience that is already disposed to share its conclusion and that is not expected to encounter the objections As our own tenets might have predicted our thinking has benefited from greater engagement in the marketplace of ideas  Contrast earlier arguments against hillarycare with something more recent like  Crisis of Abundance by Arnold Kling   which more narrowly addresses the specific cause of health cost growth  It s just not even a contest the intellectuals on the right have gotten  better at thinking about this   It is only a surprise that their views have changed if you view them as well dogmatic to policy  Such a view is inconsistent with conservatism who could give a damn about the specific nature of policy  As in   I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient for I mean to reduce its size  etc

PoliticalDiscussion,What does marijuana have to do with being murdered 
PoliticalDiscussion,You would still be able to shoot in that situation because you would qualify under the following section    A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony   You would be preventing great bodily harm to yourself In my opinion this is the most ambiguous part of the law because it is very open to interpretation what exactly constitutes a sufficiently reasonable belief that great bodily harm or death will occur if the deadly force is not used   Also I linked to the wiki page for a reason 
PoliticalDiscussion,YUP One was talking about the way you change your strategy when campaigning for the Primary and campaigning for the Presidency   the other was intended to be a secret plea for understanding of his unabashed two faced nature  Apples and Oranges indeed

PoliticalDiscussion,EDIT Sorry wrong post response 
PoliticalDiscussion,We re innocent until proven guilty in this country  Not guilty until we can prove our innocence  The burden of proof is left to the state and they should not arrest until they have sufficient evidence  And I very much support that    Even if it means a killer walks free for a few days while the police do collect evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt to international relations and an issue which has been a contentious one for the last decade seems a bit silly Sorry   I find it sad that you are willing to excuse the two faced nature of the comment Sorry   gt But since we both know we re bullshitting about the issue just do your bullshit after the election  Sounds like a great bumper sticker for the re election campaign Far better than   W  in   T  he   F  uture 
PoliticalDiscussion,  Unlike a majority of democrats   I favor gun rights over gun control and see the nd amendment as still being an important freedom   On energy policy I more strongly support funding research and development of nuclear  especially LFTR and geothermal energy production over wind and solar and definitely over coal and oil   While I support increasing the accessibility and quality of education I do not think some of the programs including student loans for the last decade have had an generally negative impact despite their intentions   edit i meant to say negative rather than positive
PoliticalDiscussion,The father s only relationship with the fetus is a genetic one whereas the woman  mixes her labor with said fetus making it hers if you accept that line of reasoning  I don t think it s fair to force a woman to carry a baby she doesn t want and I don t think it s fair to make a man pay for a child he doesn t want  I always figured the father should be able to pay the mother the cost of an abortion and lose all parental rights and responsibilities There s subtleties but it s the fairest system I could think of 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why are you surprised   I never said I was surprised that Obama would say one thing in front of the press and then promise to act differently once the election was over

PoliticalDiscussion, gt A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony  But if I am trying to kill you with my car in traffic because I m an enraged lunatic you just have to let me flip you on the freeway That doesn t seem right considering you have a gun in your car to prevent your own death No 
PoliticalDiscussion,No The law does however state that  A person who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter a person s dwelling residence or occupied vehicle is presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence and that you can use force in such a situation   The blatant lies being told by liberals about this law as a means of capitalizing on this scandal so they can reduce freedom makes me ashamed to associate with the political left     Florida
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Employment is not a good measure for this You need to consider the fact that the population has grown too Check employment rate vs population and you ll see that we actually have more workers now than we have had in the past despite slightly lower rates  True  You can also include the civil rights movement as creating a larger labor pool and depressed wages  however weight the increased pool of labor against the increased number of occupations invented since    gt arguably due to the influence companies have on the regulators who run the FCC  Right  Like the chick who approved Comcast NBC merger then quit to go work for Comcast  I call that Treason she works for the people not the person  a corp   Take the current banking cartel   banks owning  of all banking wealth  They have a monopoly at the permission of the Government  Where is Glass Steagall  Electric Bugaloo  This is a completely beneficial law as it falls in line with the latter chapters of Wealth of Nations 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I don t give a shit if Martin hit him first  Let s say you reverse their roles and you have a young armed black teen pursuing and verbally harassing a white man through a neighborhood  The white man gets more and more afraid and angry and turns around springs on his attacker and beats his head on the ground  Then the black teen pulls a gun and shoots his  attacker   In any court in the land that kid is going to jail  Zimmerman should too

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism  are forced indeed so to spoil them They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty by hideous ugliness by hideous starvation It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man s intelligence   Like supply side economics  Altruism is just selfishness  If you take a look at the statistic that CEO pay to worker pay in the  s was    Today it s    Wouldn t that capital invested in the labor force produce more gains  Sure the Capitalist can invest in more factors of production but what would that yield  like today when we obviously have a glut of aggregate supply  The parallels of  to today are staggering  Take Google  Google is a juggernaut because of how they treat their labor  They pay their employees well  with the intent of their employees not having to worry about money  This keeps their mind at work and not on balancing the rent with the food budget 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s not  evidence that the story is legitimate Trayvon was shot by Zimmerman s gun the bullethole in his chest is  evidence of that and it s not disputed The police report indicates that Zimmerman was bleeding from the nose and head which would be  evidence that something struck him in the nose and head not how that transpired  fell struck or  took a fall to backup his story  There s a difference between  evidence  unsworn allegation and sworn testimony  Also the only witness corroborating the story is anonymous perhaps with good reason however  consider the source applies here Anyone can lie to a reporter anonymously Several other witnesses are denying Zimmerman s story and claiming that police did not take a full or accurate statement from them

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Social security pays its old members with the money from the young and medium age members   It s also a poor to rich transfer I thought progressives were supposed to be against something like that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree thats a concern but no one health insurance provider has enough control over the service the health care itself to significantly inflate the level of care given to each client in each hospital If a doctor wants more money he s generally free to just recommend extra services already  what would change  If anything you could argue that this will encourage hospitals to actually fund more care for things like pediatrics or ER nursing where patients don t typically have enough care as it is   I have significant concerns about a program which forces struggling healthy unemployed underemployed people to take on insurance which will ultimately subsidise the sick   the already insured but thats an entirely different conversation   dependent on how the numbers end up shaking out in reality with time 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The only way to get costs into control is to get everyone covered  How exactly does that control costs Does getting everyone covered cause there to be less spending  The only way to get costs into control is to do what works for every other industry in the world You need to have the consumer have  skin in the game when it comes to paying for medical bills Right now you pay a copay of   or whatever regardless of where you go or what procedure you get so where exactly is the incentive to look for the best price  If we had medical savings accounts and major medical  high deductible plans which did not cover everything under the sun for   then you would see patients actually shopping around to find good deals on everything from checkups to procedures questioning if the battery of tests is really necessary for a cold they caught from someone else who recovered fine maybe stopping at walmart for their flu shot instead of going to their doctor and paying x as much and you would see healthcare providers actually competing for customers which means their prices will go down  Why do you think that the two procedures not covered by insurance  Laser Eye Surgery and Plastic Surgery have plummeted in price over the past twenty years while every other medical cost has gone up It is because there is every day competition in price 
PoliticalDiscussion,This type of micromanagement can never work due to public choice theory

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Both parties know that the cost of health care has to be managed   Which is why  both parties are shrinking   The federal government cannot manage to balance it s own books much less manage the healthcare needs of   people   If the government managed our food supply the way they manage health care a loaf of bread would be  by now   gt The only way to get costs into control is to get everyone covered   The primary reason that costs are escalating faster than other parts of the economy is because something like  of health care costs are paid for by third parties   That means that consumers have no interest in prices    If everyone had  food insurance so that you could eat as much of whatever you wanted for a fixed price everyone would get steak and lobster and caviar and food prices would be exploding   We need to get to a point where consumers take control of their care and are concerned about prices and value  Making everyone get covered is the opposite of that   gt Obama wins the election because the base is now fully energized to reform health care their way with the public option  Obamacare was less popular than Obama so this seems unlikely   gt The public option is made law  There is zero chance this will happen   gt Romney goes after every other federal program cutting everything he can to boost the profits of his inner circle pals  It s funny how you see the world as if Obama is concerned about truth justice and the American way and Romney just cares about his buddies   I hate to tell you this but you ve bought into the fake system the two parties have set up convincing people to take a side and demonize the other   Both sides are corrupt both are only in it for their friends and campaign contributors  
PoliticalDiscussion,yea fuck the whole innocent til proven guilty thing huh 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am not sure what exactly you are trying to argue Yes the judicial branch interprets legislation   The problem with extremely vague laws is that they may protect of incriminate people who the legislators would not have intended to affect For example when laws about screening possible terrorists in airports are used to harass people who are obviously not terrorists If the law is very broad then the abusive behavior may very well technically fit into the law even if that was not originally intended by the legislature A court cannot do much about this if the law is constitutional and the case fits into the scope of the law 
PoliticalDiscussion,I look at universal PC ownership as a type of  infrastructure for democracy  easy access to materials for education easy access to media production software as well as the possibility of daily polling upon nearly all issues and permutations of such 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt One nice thing about the new health care law is that  percent of an insurance companies costs have to go to direct care   Think about the unintended consequence of that for a second   If the Health Insurance company wants to increase profit what is the ONLY way they can do it with that law in place Right   Jack up the total amount of money that people spend on healthcare This  rule INCENTIVIZES health insurance companies to INCREASE the total amount of money their customers spend on healthcare thereby increasing the total profit they can attain They then use that jacked up total amount spent as proof that they need to increase premiums  they have to prove it to the Government  and the customer gets stuck with the bill 
PoliticalDiscussion,he admits talking to him first He could of said anything under the sun to this kid even put his hands on him or punch him WE WILL NEVER KNOW   SO given the fact he was also chasing the kid and Martin can not speak for himself Zimmerman loses the benefit of doubt
PoliticalDiscussion,The student debt is going to be repudiated eventually  Debt in all sectors is very high corporate debt gov t debt consumer credit card debt and student debt  None of it is sustainable and must  mathematically  collapse  Students by and large are a large voting demographic for Democrats they will get their debt repudiated at least for the most part

PoliticalDiscussion,They say all politics is local 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt when dealing with things like healthcare supply and demand is not a good descriptive theory because people are not buying a product but a perceived outcome  That misconception is one of the biggest reasons why healthcare costs are going up while costs in every other industry go down That mis logic could be applied to everything that people buy I am not buying food I am buying the perceived outcome of being less hungry I am not buying a car I am buying the perceived outcome of getting to work I am not buying cable I am buying the perceived outcome of viewing my favorite shows Healthcare is like every other industry and the fact that we don t treat it like every other industry is WHY the costs are going up so much   gt i still think that reducing costs of preventative care manually will not harm that much it will merely distribute the cost burden towards more elective procedures  Making people pay out of pocket WILL reduce the costs of preventative care because it introduces free market forces to drive competition which drives prices down Right now there is NO cost competition in healthcare which is why prices are going UP Take a look at the two main procedures that are NOT covered by insurance Laser eye and plastic surgery Both have dropped DRASTICALLY in price over the past twenty years All other medical procedures have gone up for the sole reason that patients have zero  skin in the game when it comes to costs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Write your books and try to sell them  What s your alternative  force people to read what they don t want to

PoliticalDiscussion,If everything under the sun wasn t covered   or with a copay by insurance this would not be a problem People would have a vested interest in costs and this would help weed out unnecessary procedures Also this competition would drive the prices down instead of up  which is what they have been doing recently  Medical savings accounts along with high deductible  major medical insurance plans are the best way to do this 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt the very reason that that situation arose in the first place is because so many of the same Republicans who enthusiastically voted for the massive commitments that were the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan suddenly did an about face when it came to Libya  That s why I asked you for a link to anything that supports this theory   gt mission past  days  Uh   if you mean the war powers act it s  days not      gt but can you argue that just from a military and logistical standpoint it was far less controversial than Iraq Afghanistan  Heh It was far less controversial because the people who were in the streets calling Bush a Nazi decided they didn t give a fuck if Obama started a war without congressional permission  Can you imagine what would have happened if Bush did the same Made the same  Non war argument The same  No boots argument The  NATO made me do it argument  which is also a fallacy  the Nato treaty only authorizes the president to act without congressional approval if a NATO state is attacked   which never happened Libya attacked no other state in any way    gt but I m willing to cut him some slack  You and every other hypocrite Did you protest Bush Did you call his wars illegal  when in fact they were not  Did you vilify the killing of  Brown People in Iraq but not even know about the  dead in Libya   gt and I simply can t view the GOP s whole response to the ordeal as anything but political theater designed to assail the president rather than to actually make a shrewd decision about foreign policy  Shrewd is a nice way of putting it Really sums up your entire knowledge base and blind loyalty in a single word Good luck with that

PoliticalDiscussion,No First off it would actually have to be seen by a court to see if it is unconstitutional Second taking an example from a medical procedure does not equal mandate for insurance Those are two totally different things Medicine has standard steps for certain procedures It just turns out that the abortion one will be put into law by legislatures and not by basic medical standards set by the profession These two subjects are very far apart on what they do and the SCOTUS decision on Obamacare won t do anything to the ultrasounds 
PoliticalDiscussion,If someone is following me I might confront them to see what their reasoning for following me is  I m not going to jump full on to kicking ass  Sometimes people roll up slow because they are lost  Then again it depends  If I see a car with  young males black or white rolling up on me slow   my behavior is going to be a lot different than if I see a middle aged dude rolling up on me slow  unless it s a kiddie raping van

PoliticalDiscussion,There s a couple of differing forces at play  One is the  what should you do from an individual liability point of view  don t get involved  The other is should you wait around and let the police solve every problem for you  Especially if you know their response times are such that they never actually solve any problem 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope because the  only evidence that Martin attacked Zimmerman is coming from Zimmerman himself  None of the witnesses saw the beginning of the fight they call came upon it when it was already in progress  It s entirely possible that Zimmerman tried to detain Martin and Martin tried to defend himself from some strange man who was following him   IMO more likely than Martin attacking Zimmerman   Has everyone forgotten Stranger Danger  I would imagine that was the scenario going through Martin s head    I know these are suppositions but it s an educated guess because    Martin was trying to get away from Zimmerman     Zimmerman continued to follow Martin after the  operator told him not to   He said  These assholes always get away   It makes more sense for him to try to keep this particular asshole from getting away than it does for Martin attacking him   Zimmerman has a history of violence with previous charges of assaulting a police officer and domestic violence  Also Zimmerman has a lot to lose and it s a well known fact that people are less than honest when telling their version of events particularly when those events involve homicide and the possibility of jail  Of course he s going to try to make himself look good when talking to the police    As for witnesses saying they saw Martin on top of Zimmerman there are other witnesses with conflicting observations  Regardless it wouldn t be the first time someone picked a fight and lost  until they pulled their weapon and shot their opponent dead     Bottom line if Zimmerman hadn t initiated the confrontation by following Zimmerman and then escalated by getting out of his car and following none of this would have happened  He is ultimately at fault for the death of Martin  Unfortunately according to FL law he will probably walk

PoliticalDiscussion, gt This   id seems to have been a much bigger threat than we were all lead to believe  He s only  tall actually but funny how using a  year old photo of a  year old instead of a  year old can help spread that misconception  That s what stinks about this case from the get go  The left isn t really interested in the facts  They flew off the handle from the get go with the narrative of  rich white person kills defenseless kid and gets away with it without even doing a basic assessment of facts  such as Zimmerman not being a rich white kid  
PoliticalDiscussion,According to what I ve read Zimmermann chased him down  That s not passive observance 
PoliticalDiscussion, Disobeying an order is a term of art implying that Zimmerman disobeyed a lawful command by a LEO to desist in his actions which places a certain amount of legal culpability on Zimmerman if that were the case  That is why people are arguing over the point  Furthermore people are saying  Zimmerman disobeyed an order from dispatch so it s his fault     regardless of whether or not Martin initiated felony assault on Zimmerman 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well said Empathy is extremely hard to come by in this day and time I always try to put myself in the other persons shoes I can imagine being Trayvon in this situation being scared shitless for lack of a better term The realization that no you are not being paranoid  that indeed there is someone in an suv following you for no apparently justifiable or known reason at night would have been terrifying I can then understand any scenario involving him fighting    but when I  do the same for Zimmerman    I can imagine feeling suspicious of someone in my neighborhood  I have actually experienced it first hand I can imagine checking him out and watching observing to see if my suspicions rang true i HAVE done this I can even imagine calling the police if i indeed did see something that warranted it    but this is where my empathy ends because to me the actions and reality differ    and the reasoning is all together departed from most peoples understanding of common sense  A Sad case of lives lost one in reality and one might as well be because I doubt he will have a days peace in or out of jail  I doubt from his actions that he had much to begin with anyways though I mean who is that suspicious all the time  We can not live in fear it kills divides justifies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s put our focus on the big picture  The individual mandate was a  Republican idea   Both parties know that the cost of health care has to be managed  NEMALA  signed into law by Reagan demands that sick people have to be taken care of with NO reimbursement provisions  That revenue loss does not get swept under the rug  It finds its way to he bills paid by those with insurance  The only way to get costs into control is to get everyone covered    The  Republican plan was the Individual Mandate  The  Democrat plan was the public option or simply put open enrollment in Medicare  Private health insurance companies want NO PART of this    So here s what happens if ACA gets voided    Obama wins the election because the base is now fully energized to reform health care their way with the public option  The public option is made law and most of the private insurance companies go bankrupt with just a few in business offering ultra care for the ultra rich akin to the idea that we have a public police department but a wealthy man can hire a private security guard  Romney wins election    With no AFA to cut Romney goes after every other federal program cutting everything he can to boost the profits of his inner circle pals  In  as the USA enters the Great Depression II Elizabeth Warren wins the White House and we begin a slow recovery     
PoliticalDiscussion,The news reports have consistently stated that he was under no obligation to follow the dispatcher s suggestion 
PoliticalDiscussion,The dispatch officer  recommended that Zimmerman not follow Martin  He she did not direct Zimmerman not to follow  There is a qualitative difference between saying  Do not follow the person and  You do not have to follow the person  
PoliticalDiscussion,I vote because it is my civic duty and I vote for the candidate who holds the same stance as I do on my important issues   typically guns and taxes  more for the former less for the latter   Everything else is typically a wash  If you don t vote then cool  Makes my vote worth more 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I d do exactly the opposite as Trayvon did in the case of a man following me at night through his neighborhood as soon as he got out of the car I d run away I certainly wouldn t attack the man  According to the news that I ve read Trayvon did run away from Zimmerman and Zimmerman chased him down   Testimony of the girlfriend     gt  Trayvon s girlfriend who says he was talking to her on his cellphone in the moments before he died told her  I think this dude is following me  He thought he d lost Zimmerman but then said  He is right behind me again I m not going to run I m going to walk fast  The girlfriend says she then heard another voice say  What are you doing around here  Trayvon answered  Why are you following me  She says she then heard Trayvon get pushed and the sound of his phone hitting the ground   Also according to Zimmerman     gt But in own his version of events as outlined in the Sentinel report Zimmerman had given up the chase and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when Martin approached him from behind   gt The two exchanged words before Martin punched the burly Zimmerman in the nose sending him reeling to the ground The teenager then began pummeling him and slammed his head into the sidewalk several times the newspaper said   gt At least one witness told police he saw Martin on top of Zimmerman who was calling for help the newspaper said It noted however that other witnesses had disputed from whom the cries were coming   gt ABC News quoted a police source as saying that Zimmerman in a written statement claimed that Martin also tried to take his gun before the shot was fired  Sounds to me like Trayvon had a justifiable fear of being shot by an aggressive stranger who was following him with a gun  If I were in his position I m not sure what I would do  Once I realized that the guy had a gun and was right behind me I might well give up on running and try to take the gun away since I m quite sure I can t outrun a bullet 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The police tapes show that he was instructed not to follow Martin by the  responder An order he disobeyed  Not an order  A recommendation by dispatch  A lawful order  Sir I need you to remove your hands from your pocket NOW  A recommendation  Sir you do not need to do that  Additionally if I deem you to be  suspicious  I can follow you  Legally  This is not aggressive behavior  Aggressive behavior is striking someone using fighting words in a conversation   I m going to kick your ass   menacing  putting up fists moving in aggressively  displaying a firearm  There is absolutely no evidence   at this point   that Zimmerman did anything other than follow Martin 
PoliticalDiscussion,I won t try to argue that it s not hypocritical for some Democrats to take a categorically anti war stance and then jump on board with the mission in Libya  I guess my main point was just that while by the letter of the law it is unconstitutional that Obama extended the mission past  days the very reason that that situation arose in the first place is because so many of the same Republicans who enthusiastically voted for the massive commitments that were the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan suddenly did an about face when it came to Libya  It s hard not to interpret it as a cynical political maneuver whereby they could create a scenario to nail Obama and say  Look at him tearing the Constitution to shreds and ignoring the War Powers Act   Libya is obviously not without controversy but can you argue that just from a military and logistical standpoint it was far less controversial than Iraq Afghanistan Clearly just because an action isn t  as bad as something we ve done in the past doesn t make for a totally valid justification to undertake it but there s hypocrisy on both sides of the aisle when you look at the legion of Republican representatives who were suddenly so reluctant to vote to approve a significantly smaller investment of a war  years earlier Forgive me for not being able to believe they all suddenly had a profound change of morals or a random burst of military fiscal austerity  I m not happy Obama had to continue without Congressional approval nor the precedent that sets and I would of course have preferred he d have gotten it but I m willing to cut him some slack because the entire situation was a big geopolitical win for both him and the United States and I simply can t view the GOP s whole response to the ordeal as anything but political theater designed to assail the president rather than to actually make a shrewd decision about foreign policy 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you mean inefficient non economical energy exists It s just to expensive to use I m pretty sure green energy has a lobbyists or two by how much government money they get 
PoliticalDiscussion,This  The kid chose to confront Zimmerman with violence  Zimmerman escalated the situation needlessly and could should be reprimanded for it but Martin doesn t escape all blame either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe because you get tired of being chased down by everyone  black young white neighborhood  He s an athlete being chased by some mysterious guy stalking  him He decided he had enough Many people stop running and turn around to fight at some point 
PoliticalDiscussion,However according to those same police reports he had been leaving the scene and getting back in his car when Martin confronted and attacked him  He was wrong to follow Martin but if he was disengaging from the situation when attacked is he still the aggressor  Either way his lack of arrest is pretty frustrating  If he is found innocent then he will go free but since there is still reasonable suspicion of murder he ought to be arrested 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is extortion and should be treated as such 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not saying he broke the law by following him I m saying he was advised not to follow Martin by an authority which he called for advice and help I see where you can take  an order he disobeyed as the wrong way but I m not calling the US a dictatorship   It was just how i phrased it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  is called   a fetus a baby a group of cells   in nine months it is still a child  Do you consider an acorn to be an oak tree   gt  it is choice when a woman says it is my body it is my choice it comes off as fuck you to the male  It may come off that way but that s not the case It s her body and the male has no right to force her to go through the pregnancy That s  months of doctors appointments possible maternity leave tons of health risks etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,While those may be required for a  perfect competition  far far less is necessary for a good quality competition I would dispute three of the four points there   gt First there must be many firms in the market none of which is large in terms of its sales  A firm that is large can happen but will only happen if they are providing the best quality product  and if there is no outside i e government interference  If they stop providing the best quality product then they will lose market share and no longer be  large in terms of its sales   gt Third each firm in the market produces and sells a nondifferentiated or homogeneous product  This is also not required as product quality and feature variations are a way for products to compete   gt Fourth all firms and consumers in the market have complete information about prices product quality and production techniques  While some of this information is necessary the simple fact of if the company provides this information and how much it provides can itself be a method of competition 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman was driven in a police car to the police station interviewed by police detectives and released  He was given first aid at the scene and whet to the hospital the next day on his own  Any evidence that could have held him in the tank over night was shot dead  If it is found that he falsified his statement to police in anyway he s probably screwed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry you don t get to decide what the woman does with her body end of story  Would it be ethically wrong for her to not consult and speak with you about it Yes But there s still no right for a man to force a woman to take a pregnancy to term regardless of the circumstances 
PoliticalDiscussion,My understanding is that once an X Ray machine is owned by a hospital and a technician s salary is  budgeted the cost of the service doesn t go to R D R D generally concerns drugs because the Pharmaceutical industry preforms much of its own R D A hairline fracture doesn t reveal much new information these days   Another understanding of mine is that you pay so much for these drugs because salesmen make a pitch to doctors to proscribe their latest concoctions   a doctor doesn t have time to really research if its worth the cost  he just bills it to insurance  or you or the tax base    We could do more to present doctors with unbiased information about the best treatment for specific conditions We could kindly request that essential life saving treatment not go to the creation of the next generation of viagra  R D focused on drugs which correspond to the importance of what you actually pay for  One nice thing about the new health care law is that  percent of an insurance companies costs have to go to direct care  personally I think it would be great if we could expect the same of Pharma My  layman s idea would be that investors invest in a couple drugs a company researches Any  winners which are profitable pay back the non profitable ones but after those  and investors are paid back a set rate the drug becomes cheaper  a patient shouldn t be subsidizing the marketing   RD costs of something frivolous or redundant I know  nothing about medicine however so take my idea with a grain of salt  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because  hour days suck especially if you have a shitty job

PoliticalDiscussion,The outcome  stays the same because people don t listen to this crap and vote anyway What if everyone didn t vote because the outcome would be the same You d be giving power over to a very small number of people 
PoliticalDiscussion,  but only  lbs That s a very skinny build   But the size is not the issue here The mindset is And Trayvon was in self defense mode Zimmerman was in vigilante mode Plus neighborhood watch people are told they are not allowed to carry guns or to confront That s two strikes against Zimmerman 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be honest I don t think I understand what role the stand your ground law played in this case According to the police they were satisfied that Zimmerman acted in self defense and so they didn t arrest him If there were no stand your ground law and the confrontation unfolded as Zimmerman s side claims it did  with Martin attacking him first  how would this be any different  You re allowed to shoot people in self defense I have no clue at this point whether Zimmerman acted in that capacity or was the instigator of violence so I m going to stay out of the speculating the facts of the case But I don t see where stand your ground fits into all this 
PoliticalDiscussion,when dealing with things like healthcare supply and demand is not a good descriptive theory because people are not buying a product but a perceived outcome  I agree with you generally that we need to reduce the spending on low probability of success procedures or rather make this type of spending have a greater impact on the decision maker but i still think that reducing costs of preventative care manually will not harm that much it will merely distribute the cost burden towards more elective procedures 
PoliticalDiscussion,he can absolutely be told not to follow someone in a public place  He doesn t have to obey that suggestion unless it is a lawful order by a police officer but the dispatcher is a police officer so he   should  have obeyed  Edit  emphasizing the should to indicate it would have been a better decision  Note that it is not  must or any legally binding directive 
PoliticalDiscussion,I can t buy the self defense view    He was  feet from home and an athelete  He dodged Zimmerman by cutting to the inner walkway between the buildings  Why did he not run the rest of the way home  retreat while you can versus confronting an unknown threat  Don t get me wrong i think zimmerman is  in the wrong for setting up the whole situation but i also don t think this boy acted in complete  self defense  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Any attempt to bring up the Constitution in order to criticize Libya is a smokescreen to shield the Republicans from taking the blame for their pointless obstructionism there s nothing more to it than that  So then you have the link to the article that describes how Obama pleaded with congress to approve the Libya mission  Here is a link to Dennis Kucinich  one of the only democrats who acted the same under Bush as under Obama calling for impeachment        Of course Dennis got the message to shut the fuck up  days later and was re districted to a loss of his position in the government   But at least he was honest 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the key problem is that Neighborhood Watch is not supposed to confront people  The call to police was made the police were on the way to the call and he was instructed by the  Operator to stop following the suspect  In many states the  operators work for the police and if you threaten   abuse them you will find out quickly that they are not your average IT help desk personnel  Zimmerman continued his pursuit out of his vehicle when he lost sight of the boy when he left the sidewalk for the internal sidewalk that runs between the buildings  While I would most likely not confront someone following me in this way when I was  yards from my house I can understand the fear and anger that someone might feel when they are followed for having ice tea while wearing a hoodie  I see some fault in both sides but as a CCW I have to put the fault on Zimmerman for parading around like he was a cop ignoring orders by authorities and putting himself in this situation 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But do you really feel that leaving Libya to the mercy of Gaddafi would have been a better option  Did I say that No Did I even insinuate it No What I insinuated was that a president should get the constitutionally required permission of congress What I insinuated was that Obama s invention of  Non war is both despicable and outrageous I insinuated his supporters are the biggest hypocrites on the planet as they all argue his  Non war policy as a smart and great thing  when they argued that the two wars that  had congressional approval were illegal   gt It s not something that will be fixed in the short term  No shit I prefer the democrats from   when they were led by John Kerry and preached a  We broke it we need to fix it policy The democrats who argued that George Bush should have sent in  troops to secure Iraq as he dismantled it s government   gt The military action was only unconstitutional because a united bloc of Republicans decided it was another perfect opportunity to try to screw Obama and give him one more issue they blocked him on  Maybe you can link us to an article that reviews your point  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Castle Doctrine came over from English common law Every state applies some version of it but most have also codified it In NY for example there s a duty to retreat in one s own home if one can safely do so 
PoliticalDiscussion,Price caps are  never a good idea The price of an MRI or X ray scan is not based on the physical cost of doing it The price is determined by forces of supply and demand  how much people are willing to pay one vs how much doctors and technicians are willing to accept   If you want prices to be more reasonable you need to remove the disconnect between out of pocket costs and procedures Out of pocket costs only constitute about  of American healthcare spending This causes people to get all kinds of unnecessary care because the additional cost to them is negligible  most of their spending is done in the form of insurance premiums or taxes that they pay regardless 
PoliticalDiscussion,The only thing  r politics  r politics is a good indicator of is the massive amount of juvenile idiots that inhabit Reddit 
PoliticalDiscussion,well one could argue that most political discussion is a retelling of the PR blurbs that have been put out there for decades by someone or other  So it really isn t any different    
PoliticalDiscussion,read the post carefully    
PoliticalDiscussion, gt In my opinion this is the most ambiguous part of the law because it is very open to interpretation what exactly constitutes a sufficiently reasonable belief that great bodily harm or death will occur if the deadly force is not used  That s what we have the court system for 
PoliticalDiscussion,If Trayvon ran that would just fuel Zimmerman you could easily see  What does this guy have to hide Why is he running What is he up to  It would be no surprise he would give chase  Zimmerman probably didn t plan on killing anyone but i m sure he was looking for an excuse any night of the weak to use his weapon on a black person based on his prior calls and history 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The police tapes show that he was instructed not to follow Martin by the  responder An order he disobeyed  As an American citizen Zimmerman has a  constitutional right to move freely   within the country  in public areas unless there is probable cause to detain arrest him He cannot be told not to follow Martin if Martin is walking in a public place Zimmerman has no obligation to obey that order 
PoliticalDiscussion,i am not talking about all procedures though just ones that help with preventive care in order to make later procedures unnecessary  I don t think we would want people to avoid procedures  and other services like physical therapy that would reduce more serious and expensive procedures and services 
PoliticalDiscussion,DOES NOT MATTER  Zimmerman followed Martin under no threat after being not to do so by   If anything Martin should have felt threatened when seeing a fat man with a gun running after him 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree But put yourself your wife child mother etc in Trayvon s place We know  according to Zimmerman s own words on the  call that Trayvon ran He fled He was scared  Who knows what happened after that but the catalyst was Zimmerman pursuing him Had Zimmerman not been unjustly pursuing harassing him this never would have happened  As far as I can tell Zimmerman committed this violence in the perpetration of a crime 
PoliticalDiscussion,The humanitarian aid part was preventing Gaddafi from escalating his general massacres to an all out bloodbath with the Libyan populace as the victims  No one claims it s a simple situation or that there aren t a lot of complex issues that were introduced in Libya But do you really feel that leaving Libya to the mercy of Gaddafi would have been a better option It s not something that will be fixed in the short term but the country would not have been better off with Gaddafi remaining in power  The military action was only unconstitutional because a united bloc of Republicans decided it was another perfect opportunity to try to screw Obama and give him one more issue they blocked him on None of them opposed it out of genuine concern for presidential overreach especially considering foreign military adventurism is about the only area where the conservative establishment is perfectly content to drop the whole small government mantra  If a Republican president had done something similar without managing to get the approval of congress due to Democratic opposition conservatives would brush the constitutional issues aside as they did with every erosion of civil liberties during the Bush administration They d applaud him for having the gall to stand up and take action despite Congress obstinately refusing to give the O K  and they d jump straight to the bombastic rhetoric and brand the Democrats and any Republicans who happened to dissent traitors for doing so  The only good wars are the  constitutional ones that Republican administrations start which manage to get congressional approval on the basis of lies and fear mongering and cost us trillions of dollars years of exhaustion to achieve constantly redefined goals and thousands of lives all while inspiring prostests around the globe and destroying American credibility abroad right   Not the  month conflict with no boots on the ground a reasonable price tag full NATO collaboration and a reviled dictator dead No clearly the salient issue there is the Constitution not the petty efforts of a morally and ideologically bankrupt political party to score short term political points by opposing a president attempting to efficiently affect positive change in the world  Any attempt to bring up the Constitution in order to criticize Libya is a smokescreen to shield the Republicans from taking the blame for their pointless obstructionism there s nothing more to it than that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Both sides are equally guilty of bad behavior Nobody is innocent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just a thought I mean   how can you control costs when you are forced to provide a service for free  Either healthcare is not free and you should pay for it or you don t receive it  Maybe we can have a compromise called the ER Single Payer plan   we all pay into it and get free ER services and response and that s it  Once your condition is stabilized you re on your own  or you have insurance   The ER Plan doesn t come with prescription plans and you can be rejected if the ER Doctor deems you to be stable enough on your own 
PoliticalDiscussion,You live up to your name Personally I find it reassuring to not have dead bodies piling up outside of hospitals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman himself said that Martin was trying to take away his gun so I d say everything from the point where Martin first hit him until Zimmerman shot him was Zimmerman s fault  I sure wouldn t make one attempt to take his gun knock him down and then step back to give him a better shot  As far as I m concerned if someone with a gun is confronting someone who isn t threatening them or someone else that person should probably be going to jail  A gun is for self defense but Zimmerman was clearly using it as a substitute for courage and that s utterly inappropriate 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I personally believe that either a single payer system or a completely private system would be better than what we have Our current system is a hybrid that combines the worst of both  Agreed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right on  Your point is bolstered by the fact that European countries with universal single payer systems have lower per capita health care costs than we do 
PoliticalDiscussion,not funny

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Using the  tax laws a single person with no dependents making k a year will pay around  in federal taxes A k deduction results in about  in tax payments  Right so by your calculations if healthcare costs were not deducted that person would be out  k instead of  k  That s  k in their pocket while getting much needed coverage   would you rather pay  k total  Or  k total   gt The average payment in  was  a year for individual healthcare The individuals who cannot receive health insurance now are those that are higher risk high risk premiums typically run   times the normal premium costs That s around k a year  low end  Simple tax deductions are not nearly enough to incentivize people to voluntarily enter into the insurance market They are still paying positive ammounts for the service and still have the ability to opt out They would save far more money by opting out and would likely chose to do so  They d stop pretty quickly if they were denied healthcare for opting out     gt If there is no mandate people will always opt out  And if there is a mandate  buy insurance or pay a fine  then what s stopping them from doing the same  If their healthcare costs are so high and opting out is cheaper then wouldn t the fine need to be quite extravagant in order to penalize them into getting insurance  Like in the thousands of dollars   gt And historically speaking tax incentives of any sort have done little to incentivize consumer behavior  I know plenty of people who bought a house to get  k   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well thank you for proving my point   We don t know the whole story We don t even know the most important part of the story  was Zimmerman s life at risk at the time he pulled the trigger    Without evidence proving that Zimmerman s life wasn t at risk at the time he pulled the trigger I think he has a very strong legal case to make of his innocence  Edit    gt There are also apparently witnesses who say Zimmerman was on top of Martin  It is my understanding that they witnessed this  after Martin was shot not   at the time  he was shot Of course if Zimmerman was on top of Martin in a dominant physical position at the time he pulled the trigger that would be pretty damning proof that it was unnecessary force 
PoliticalDiscussion,But if the United States is attacked he will be defended by the US Military He has the benefit of being paid in US currency and can easily engage in interstate commerce because of the State  We re talking about a social contract here in abstract terms We can debate the specifics of our specific State but in general you give up some of your money time or property in exchange for certain benefits and protections afforded by the State 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree State run and funded libraries are the best solution Kids can rent books play on educational sites that mix education and playing and can even have volunteers come in to show the kids new things or do activities I m not in favor of just giving poor people more to go buy a book when they can request it at their local library and more people can share a book than otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will never happen The blacks are too busy eating chicken the jews are too busy stealing all the money the mexicans are all asleep and the white man is too busy having a society 
PoliticalDiscussion,Consider where this  evidence comes from  The statement of a man who shot and killed an unarmed teenager  Would you really expect him to present his actions in anything other than a favorable light  Details leaked by a police department under fire for not investigating the shooting  Do you really think they leaked selective details in the interest of truth and justice or are they trying to sway public opinion and cover up their own incompetence  A witness who claims to have seen Martin on top of Zimmerman  Although the police say there are corroborating witnesses I ve seen no indication that anyone witnessed how the fight started  They re not necessarily claiming there are corroborating witnesses for all aspects of Zimmerman s story  If you re really interested in the legal issues pay attention to legalistic language from interested parties  There are also apparently witnesses who say Zimmerman was on top of Martin  Zimmerman s wounds  The  Orlando Sentinel report says he was bleeding from the nose had a swollen lip and had lacerations on the back of his head  It also notes that he did not go to the hospital until the next day  His lawyer subsequently claimed that his nose was broken which the right wing media have taken as gospel truth  Is this evidence that Martin hurt him  Probably  Is it evidence that Martin started the fight or that Zimmerman was innocently walking away when Martin started the fight  Of course not  A good lie usually contains elements of truth 
PoliticalDiscussion,One clarification I don t know if there is evidence coming out that Martin attacked Zimmerman first That s what Zimmerman is saying The evidence only suggests that Martin was  winning    Even the witnesses   they were inside their houses they came outside looked outside called the police after Zimmerman started yelling for help No one except Zimmerman and Martin saw the first punch   Beyond that I think this is a good discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Using the  tax laws a single person with no dependents making k a year will pay around  in federal taxes A k deduction results in about  in tax payments   The average payment in  was  a year for individual healthcare The individuals who cannot receive health insurance now are those that are higher risk high risk premiums typically run   times the normal premium costs That s around k a year  low end  Simple tax deductions are not nearly enough to incentivize people to voluntarily enter into the insurance market They are still paying positive ammounts for the service and still have the ability to opt out They would save far more money by opting out and would likely chose to do so If there is no mandate people will always opt out And historically speaking tax incentives of any sort have done little to incentivize consumer behavior 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt i still think that reducing costs of preventative care manually will not harm that much it will merely distribute the cost burden towards more elective procedures  regarding this yes you re right i guess i was wrong in using this terminology but i think that when people buy healthcare they are buying something that is different from buying other things  You re not buying utility you re buying life which i feel is very overvalued as well as costing more and more for other things that is to say increase non healthy life expectancy increases costs everywhere else but people still do it   gt Take a look at the two main procedures that are NOT covered by insurance Laser eye and plastic surgery  Is there an example of a non elective procedure that is near universally paid out of pocket i think those procedures might behave differently 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clearly they are the cause of all crime     
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know if the evidence ultimately comes out that the events took place in the following order   Zimmerman stalks the kid   Kid confronts Zimmerman then the  Kid hits Zimmerman for no reason other than he was following him and begins to bash his head into the concrete   Then Zimmerman shoots him rightly so fearing for his life  If it took place in that order it is regrettable but Zimmerman legally shouldn t go to jail Following someone is not illegal no matter how racially or otherwise motivated it may have been I can follow you and call you hateful things all day but you have no right to bash my skull in  Assaulting someone however is illegal unless in self defense So regrettably this young man decided to swing under these hypothetical circumstances All the evidence isn t in yet though   Now if it shows that Zimmerman started the fight with a fist first and then shot when he was getting his ass kicked then hell yes he should be arrested because he started the physical altercation and it was this young man that was defending himself fearing for his life making his actions  young mans justified  Ultimately until all the evidence is in and until the crucial question of who swung first physically started the altercation first is answered all we can do is speculate Stand your ground laws however will support Zimmerman given he didn t start the fight with a physical attack 
PoliticalDiscussion,a boy can dream   
PoliticalDiscussion,And how many of those republicans up for re election are likely to lose to a democrat vs how many democrats up for re election are likely to lose to a republican in their district 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem lies with the largest proponents of racist allegations who are in fact racist themselves How can racism end when communities idealize bigots like Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson who have their entire careers based on racism The  racism crisis will never end so long as we have ideologues who perpetuate the idea that a national focus on race is important in the first place

PoliticalDiscussion,Incentives  The money spent on healthcare  personally is gov t money not spent on your behalf for medical care  Therefor all money spent on personal healthcare costs should be deductible from your total income  That means if you make  k spend  k on health insurance doctor s visits etc then that  k is no longer taxable  Your taxable income becomes  k  Which has implications on your effective tax rates etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes but it will just turn into a festering pile of hate and division Personally I think we should just avoid race I consider myself colorblind Especially towards red and green people 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is as good an excuse as any I suppose   Of course the democrats are not set to pick up any seats in the house and Obama and his team have been crying about congress and how they won t support him   so Your excuse sounds like just that an excuse 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then why bother with tax deductions They will only slightly offset premium costs and will not have the force to push people into coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps the problem would be getting congress to agree to whatever position he chooses during an election year Thus the ability to be more flexible after the election is a result of knowing that congress will be able to be more flexible

PoliticalDiscussion,I think it might be interesting to have mandatory transparent records detailing everyone s compensation online At least then consumers and employees would be informed about their choices and avoid companies with truly disproportionate compensation  I m sure it would be seen as a huge invasion of privacy but I think it s just a matter of cultural norms If we did it for a few decades it would seem totally normal   Here s a related story about the  value of big coaching salaries       gt BILL TSITSOS Overall we found that most of the programs with the highest paid coaches in football and basketball experienced no change in their athletic performance and ranking either over the short term or over the long term   gt VEDANTAM So what Tsitsos and Nixon have found is about one in five teams does actually improve does win more games But three in five teams essentially stay the same in the rankings And here s the shocker One in five teams actually does worse when they have one of these top paid coaches  I think as a culture we have to start questioning the value of people s compensation Executives should have to justify their value with actual data showing long term performance If similar people can provide the same value for less money companies should stop wasting money on this ever increasing compensation Company structures can be slow to change and it s difficult to take these risks and experiment with different models   especially when their current method is to just outbid their competitors for talent 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a single  figure wage earner with no kids the Bush tax cuts expiring would mean an increase of about  to me  Go ahead    I didn t think the Bush tax cuts were a big boon for me then and i certainly don t feel differently now  I think the reason why we say repeal them for the rich is because they are the ones who have reaped the real benefits of the tax code changes  And they have been reaping those changes since  while real wages in the middle of America have been unchanged  or gone down if you look at just male income  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt the idea of giving someone  insurance for a pre existing condition is no different than giving someone a homeowner s policy while his house is on fire  I agree with this but I also believe that we should have a way to help these people  I don t think it is possible without government intervention  The free market will throw them to the wolves  Unless you are ok with telling people with pre existing conditions to suck it we have to come up with some sort of compromise 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that given the makeup of the court it is very likely that the individual mandate  which was a conservative idea will be shot down From their I think we have  options a single payer plan or continue with what we ve been doing as it bankrupts us as a country and leaves millions uninsured 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  year olds can be tried as adults and they are all the time  So can a  year old who commits murder Society still views them as a child 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fixed
PoliticalDiscussion,never watched fox news but i know enough gun weilding twats that have the exact attitude on anyone that  steps to them or challenges their authority mostly police officers  Oh i hope he d try something  Yeah i d like to see him pull something on me i d light him up  You re naive to think that this attitude doesn t exist especially in someone already shown to have racist tendencies 
PoliticalDiscussion, year olds can be tried as adults and they are all the time  And I m giving hypothetical situations at this point we have no idea who started the altercation 
PoliticalDiscussion,At least you re honest    Brief explanation of price controls     One of my favorite examples of price controls is from Brazil during their inflation crisis The government passed a law making it illegal to raise prices so the ranchers hid the cattle and no one could buy meat  It s a great podcast even if it s not completely related to the issue at hand   
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed but I still think it is an important distinction   We don t need you to do that can be implied as  You don t have to do this but you also can if you want    We don t want you to do that can only imply one thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just a thought maybe Zimmerman did initiate the violence by attempting to grab him or perhaps showing his weapon It would be easy to believe running was no longer an option at that point You can t outrun a gun and if he was already grabbed or similar it may be difficult to run without first responding to the assault 
PoliticalDiscussion,I had the quote wrong I disagree with it being very different though In either case it s not an order and as far as I know there is no legal obligation to follow it 
PoliticalDiscussion,There was at least one person who near the confrontation he said he yelled at them to stop it and was on his way to help when his dog got away from him  Didn t help Trayvon so you are  incorrect   people contacted the police  That s not passively watching some guy get killed  The first rule in ANY situation is to maintain your own safety first  The bystanders didn t know if the combatants were armed and bullets have a tendency to travel pretty far if the shooter misses his target  Statistically a high percentage of injuries sustained by police officers is when they intervene in a physical altercation but it s their job to do so  At least they have workman s comp to pay the bills    Zimmerman pulled the trigger  The blame lies with him  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hindsight is    But it s  not hindsight There was a dude walking thru the neighborhood Zimmerman s paranoid self  I mean how many times did he call the police     saw something that  wasn t there  It s legal to walk thru a neighborhood No crime was being committed  Plus put yourself in Martin s shoes If someone was following you home at  PM on a rainy night might you too decide to run    Reasonable people call the cops if they see something suspicious They don t confront the guy I m not even confronting the guy if he s stealing something  and not just I  suspect it I mean if I see him climbing out of a busted window with some electronics  I m going to be a good witness because   my life  is not worth my own Xbox much less somebody else s  Xbox   I m only getting involved if I think someone s life or health are at risk And then only if I think I can leverage a tactical advantage because I don t want to make it worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,Most people dont understand the basics many people have no clue that state in this instance is synonymous with country    When they think about it they usually dont arrive at the right answer  The  Oh now I get it  moment  until they review history and what politicians of the past have explained in their letters  lt  lt Most people dont read deeply into history they go off of what they want in that very moment and it leads to mistaken conclusions that should be non existent in these days  non existent because it has been tried and the leaders of the past have seen the negative consequences of them  
PoliticalDiscussion, We don t need you to do that is very different from  We don t want you to do that  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt This doesn t raise demand for medical services it raises the demand for medical insurance  The word  insurance doesn t mean what it usually means when in the context of heath care in America For example the idea of giving someone  insurance for a pre existing condition is no different than giving someone a homeowner s policy while his house is on fire   I haven t been to a doctor in  years and I have no insurance Force me to buy insurance and I m am going to get every possibly ass ache I have checked out    gt I personally believe that either a single payer system or a completely private system would be better than what we have Our current system is a hybrid that combines the worst of both  That I agree with  
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel wonderful thank you  How are you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What is illegal is Martin then sucker punching this guy and breaking his nose and then bashing his head into the ground  You are assuming that Zimmerman did not start the altercation and that Treyvon martin was defending himself   gt  I don t want any of this  Martin s a child bullshit either Martin was a  year old male perfectly physically capable of beating and killing some stupid fat guy   year old is still not an adult in our society 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Zimmerman can in any jurisdiction claim self defense once a fight has broken out so long as he reasonably feels his life was in danger  If I start a fight with you and put you in a position where you feel your life is in danger and you fight back and ultimately lose I can t claim self defense because I thought you were going to kill me before I killed you  At least unless I can convince everyone else that YOU started it and I was fighting back in self defense     
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah well if there is one thing this story doesn t lack it s confusion over what went down 
PoliticalDiscussion,Zimmerman now admits he met Trayvon and exchanged words then turned and went to his truck when he was attacked read the news  
PoliticalDiscussion,That s absolutely true but can we then assume that Martin was completely free of blame  I think people are rushing to conclusions before the investigation s have come to any and it s quite unwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Health Care is not a consumer good  Laser Eye Surgery and Plastic Surgery are luxury consumer goods  Just because they are both performed by doctors doesn t make them comparable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well Zimmerman clearly got out of his car and moved into the common area between the housing units  What happened between then the gun shot and when people finally looked out of their windows is known only to the person left standing  Zimmerman    History is written by the victors  
PoliticalDiscussion,So now my friend s just the  Head of Employee Morale  Or I stick him in middle management somewhere 
PoliticalDiscussion,This happened at pm  Should there be a curfew law for that time of day    gt I also carry a firearm with me and exit my vehicle several times a day and have never shot anyone dead  Riiiight  were you pursuing someone you thought was a potential criminal  You re being a bit disingenuous there    gt I m sticking to my guns here and saying the main people at fault are all those assholes who ignored the horrific cries for help and let a person die in their front yards  people called  at the time several before the shooting in fact you can hear the gun going off in one of the calls  It happened very fast  And considering how dangerous it is to get involved when people are physically fighting I don t blame them  They are not responsible for Martin s death  
PoliticalDiscussion,To be fair there should be a third machine for the single payer option Even Universal healthcare needs a layer of bureaucracy in place to control costs 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Does anyone else think it s possible to even have an honest and open discussion about race in the US  No they will just demagogue 
PoliticalDiscussion,Except why bother  The fee doesn t do shit in my opinion and is borderline unconstitutional  It s not a good enough incentive to keep people from opting out and it s not high enough to offset the costs of those who seek healthcare without insurance  
PoliticalDiscussion,He hasn t been charged of a crime yet He may and he may not Do you have some inside information the cops would be interested in If not let the legal system do its job and quit being judge jury and executioner   The real crime will be when someone tries to collect the bounty from the fine upstanding folks with the New Black Panthers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh no I understand how the justice system works  I just hadn t seen the reports that he was taken into custody for questioning  I thought he had been released at the scene 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well there we go 
PoliticalDiscussion,Prices would stay the same or go down   Under the current system hospitals are already providing these services   they just aren t being paid for them  The Federal government already has to partially reimburse hospitals that receive a disproportionate share of uninsured and poor patients In many cases health systems are still not able to eat these costs even with government subsidies      Hospitals pass those costs on to other patients and everyone ends up with higher premiums 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is a state issue but the bill of rights applies to state law as well Meaning slavery is illegal on the state level you can own guns and you have freedom of religion 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree good sir 
PoliticalDiscussion,It hasn t been proven that Zimmerman is innocent It hasn t been proven he stalked Trayvon Martin Nothing as yet has been proven except a kid was shot and killed   Judgmental much 
PoliticalDiscussion,also no one said Trayvon is innocent perfect but since Zimmerman was not arrested so he can be proven right he has to live in fear of black men for the rest of his life   Be careful what you wish for
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah ask yourself that when you think about Trayvon Zimmerman was a afraid of Trayvon so he stalked him that is ok Trayvon is afraid of Zimmerman so he stalked him   real cut and dry right 
PoliticalDiscussion,Insurance will be less likely to refuse to reimburse already provided care if their profit model is dependent on providing care It seems like it will tie reimbursements to profit but it doesn t seem to give insurance any more leverage over providers than they already have 
PoliticalDiscussion,People like you deserve to be wrongly accused of something and have to serve the full sentence Innocent until proven guilty 
PoliticalDiscussion,nope
PoliticalDiscussion,Ok well extend this idea to entire executive level  Limit total executive salary to the total expenditure   so all executives have to split the pool 
PoliticalDiscussion,This doesn t raise demand for medical services it raises the demand for medical insurance  Medical services are more or less static  The idea here is that those costs are then spread among a larger pool  In theory it makes sense  In practice though as Cputerace says the problem is that no one has any skin in the game  In order for private healthcare to work consumers need a choice of providers and a reason for that to matter    I personally believe that either a single payer system or a completely private system would be better than what we have  Our current system is a hybrid that combines the worst of both  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Using a tax based system would at least off set costs for middle class folks and provide an incentive for health insurance  A tax deduction would still result in a positive cost for individuals because the tax incentives wouldn t cover the full cost of premiums likely not even close If we refuse to switch to a single payer system there must be a mandate if we wish to achieve full coverage Without a fee based mandate  there is no reason why you couldn t have both tax incentives and a fee based mandate there would still be the opting out problem If people are faced with the free choice of adding costs for services they previously did not have there will always be many people that chose to opt out And for many of them that it the rational choice Tax incentives without a strong mandate will simply pump more money into a broken system A purely tax incentive system would likely show little increases in coverage 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But there was no problem   Hindsight is      Lets say you have reasonable suspicion that someone is up to no good    Wearing a hoodie in warm weather and darting in between houses eschewing the road may or may not qualify as suspicious behavior  With reasonable people this is how this situation should go down  Neighborhood watch  Hey what are you doing   Suspicious guy  Oh I m going to my dad s house over here  His name is xxx xxx   End of story  No lines crossed  No one shot dead  Somewhere the Zimmerman Martin interaction deviated from what should have been a routine interaction  We don t know if Zimmerman gave chase and Martin thought he was being stalked and ran or if he doubled back and ambushed Zimmerman or if he got offended that Zimmerman was following him because he was black and simply assault him     that being said my larger point wasn t that Zimmerman should or should not have confronted Martin but that it isn t a black or white answer  Maybe he or someone else in the neighborhood had tried that before and the response was underwhelming  Maybe he was too busy playing vigilante to care  We simply don t know but everyone is assuming that Zimmerman should have let the police handle it based on hind sight  Sort of like   if you knew you were going to accidentally shoot someone and kill them if you took your concealed weapon with you today would you do it  Probably not  But you don t have that information available to you when you make the decision to carry 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I agree thats a concern but no one health insurance provider has enough control over the service the health care itself to significantly inflate the level of care given to each client in each hospital  Sure they can They can periodically audit doctors cases and question them on why they ordered certain tests   gt If a doctor wants more money he s generally free to just recommend extra services already  what would change  If they knew the insurance company could audit their recommendations then they would be much more careful in what they recommended and why   gt If anything you could argue that this will encourage hospitals to actually fund more care for things like pediatrics or ER nursing where patients don t typically have enough care as it is  So which is it Does the  rule incentivize more spending or less spending You seemed to indicate it would not in the frst paragraph but now you indicate it would incentivize more spending  
PoliticalDiscussion,difference is this THUG was not out looking for Zimmerman or robbing places Zimmerman on the other hand    Got your number buddy
PoliticalDiscussion,If ACA goes down tomorrow Vermont can start implementing the single payer bill they signed last year instead of  or   if they get a waiver per ACA  On that basis alone ACA needs to go  As single payer spreads like wildfire the entire for profit primary health insurance industry dies as opposed to being strengthened under ACA  There is absolutely nothing that Congress and the President can agree on  The Republicans are already against their own plan  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt He s trading those  days for the benefits   The Supremes have ruled that he has  no legal right to any social security benefits whatsoever      gt and protections of living under a State  The courts have ruled that police have  no legal obligation to protect citizens    t s   
PoliticalDiscussion,My guess is that they ll either go back and try for public option  I hope or they restructure this as a tax deduction for all who have purchased insurance The former would piss the insurance industry off royally and the later would involve a tax increase for everyone who doesn t purchase insurance so the dems will be facing some headwinds either way but both options are clearly constitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are considering the surveillance potential I am guessing

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Capital Punishment isn t any cheaper than life in prison but America has had more people executed on Capital Punishment than any other country including the Middle East and China   The US has executed  people since   China is estimated to execute more people than that  annually   Iran Saudi Arabia and Iraq all executed more people than the US last year  and every year prior I could find data for  
PoliticalDiscussion,Everyone s taxes are already going into the program Raise the tax a certain percentage or whatever is needed I mean there is probably more complexity in carrying it out but it seems simple 
PoliticalDiscussion,Honestly I m much more swayed by the article that by your statements  Your disagreement seems like semantics to me you say that Medicare is undercharging hospitals while insurers pay a more fair negotiated rate  The article implies that medicare obtains fair rates while insurance companies pay too high of rates  The difference is just what you consider to be a  fair rate  Given how expensive US healthcare is comparatively you must reach the conclusion that we are overcharged for care compared to Europe  As such the paper s narrative makes more sense than yours you imply that government undercharges while private insurances reaches a  fair rate which indicates that overall we pay too little for healthcare which is simply not the case 
PoliticalDiscussion,To be honest Raytheon McDonnel Douglas and Boeing shouldn t be as big as they are  Thats like saying  you can t just make investment banks smarter by saying they can t do things that they re doing now   And those jobs wouldn t be entirely lost at all  They would be moved  to compete with incoming soldiers trained in their positions in the new government research and production facilities  Would jobs be lost  Probably  Would new jobs be created with so many smart people out there and new industries coming up to meet new demands  every dollar spent goes somewhere  If you take the money being spent on the military and spend it somewhere else that doesn t involve giving massive sums to small groups of people new jobs are going to be created somewhere  With the education thing  all professors WILL NOT be paid the same  They ll be paid according to their education  It will still be possible to become educated OUTSIDE the state system in private schools  through scholarship or savings  The professors teaching  and  would be the same people teaching  courses at colleges and the next step up as well     year degrees are free for everyone   year degrees are free for the smartest  Salaries are paid by the government  States and municipalities can fire whomever they want and apply for grants to pay them what they ask  The top minds never come into academia for the money  thats ridiculous  If you want to teach you teach  The system can be worked so that salaries stay the same or go up for everyone except for university administrations  The TSA and DEA are massive wastes of money  Again jobs that should have never existed  They don t have to dissapear all at once but slowly they should be dissolved and replaced  TSA agents could easily apply to work at privately run security at the same airport they were working t before  They d be qualified  DEA agents could use their same skills working for the FBI or THE intelligence agency that would be all of the alphabet ones consolidated into one entity with limited beaurocracy  No religious laws doesn t mean  no law mentioned in religion   It means the basis for any law can t be based on religion  OBVIOUSLY murder theft and fraud are wrong  Keeping your store open on sunday isn t  That s what I meant  Maybe I m wrong about the guns  But a line does need to be drawn somewhere  Back in the day there was no such thing as an affordable weapon capable of such massive damage  It makes no sense for anyone to have a  cal in NYC  At all  So yes I would say keep it in Alaska  And there is no reason I can think of that body armor should be sold without a permit  what s the point again if no one has armor piercing rounds  It s not that radical of an idea at all  in europe this would be considered WAY right wing  there having ANY type of gun with you EVER is illegal  Health care cost cutting is not out to  fuck doctors and the extensive monetary and time costs they invested in learning their craft   For starters monetary costs would be reduced since becoming a doctor would involve being in the top portion of your class anyways in which case you could move on to your second  years and then if you were a pre med major and met a minimum standard you could continue learning your craft at little no cost due to government subsidies  Time costs are covered  I said that pay would be based on the amount of skill and difficulty of the type of medicine  A heart surgeon makes more than a nurse  Salary fixes could be based around competitive salaries at the moment and given inflation deflation adjustments over time  Would they be making less  Quite possibly  Would it cost them less  Most definitely  Would it be unfair  I m not so sure  Going out to the lowest bidder  Not at all  You could easily create a performance based pay scale for particular practices on a case by case basis  You force someone to finish something they don t want to by not letting anyone get a job without a diploma  Maybe you could add a voluntary opt out at  for lower performing students or students who want to go to military academies and join the military but i still say without being an approved drop out  you get a lesser valued diploma  or a military man  no diploma no job by law  Do I want to create a nanny state  I wouldn t say exactly that but   maybe  Our problem as a nation is that intellectually we have fallen behind most other developed countries of the world  I can t see how extending school to age  is that different than getting rid of summer vacation  a much  less radical policy that is much more widely accepted   And maybe I have forgotten how many jobs are tied to shitty alphabet soup government organizations  Please remind me and we can discuss it  P  I appreciate the criticism but again undertand I posted this as a ramble  It s not refined or even close to perfect  It s a basis for discussion which is again why its in  r PoliticalDiscussion  r PoliticalDiscussion and not  r politics  r politics 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I can see how this  money invested explains why new drugs are expensive but I don t think it can be used to argue for the overall expensiveness of healthcare in the US    Sure it can Think about how much it costs to get an MD or a DDS degree After  years of schooling and hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition fees and expenses doctors expect to get paid for their investment Hospital administrators too are a product of the same system and have probably invested the same or similar time and energy into achieving their position They too expect a substantial payoff which can only be paid through medical fees  By contrast in a European style system where education is heavily subsidized medical students don t have to take on the crushing debt load that perspective US doctors are forced to endure My assumption is that this leads to a diminished income expectation  though I m sure European doctors aren t starving and more focus on providing care than making a buck   I think you re correct in assuming that the  for profit insurance model in the US contributes to costs by divorcing consumers from the true cost of healthcare   Why not get three more tests Insurance will pick it up    However I believe that even the free market value of medical care would still leave most Americans unable to pay for basic services The fact is that most Americans   to be exact are not even fiscally responsible enough to pay off their credit cards every month indicates that most of us would not be disciplined enough to save for care   Faced with these stark choices to force Americans to pay full market value for medical services to turn medical remuneration over to  for profit rd parties who pay for some care by refusing others or to force citizens to contribute to their own care  through taxes or a mandatory HSA program similar to Singapore s Medisave  I think a government sponsored or mandated program is the most likely to provide the most care for the most people Call that  single payer if you d like 
PoliticalDiscussion,Voting preserves my right to complain 
PoliticalDiscussion,The high rate of violence and crime in the US can t be easily explained I ll give you a hint though   in the US if you fail to come up with enough money you don t survive The government doesn t have your back Being close to the edge worrying a lot about money among other problems is worrying about survival Worrying about survival causes a lot of tension and leads one to result to violence much quicker than normal  Also a lot of people living in ghettos suffer from PTSD More people are killed by gun violence in the US on an annual basis than US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan US citizens who don t leave the ghetto get PTSD from urban shootings PTSD also causes lashes of violence  The US doesn t seem to have programs to rehabilitate violent people we just lock them up and put them in a more hostile environment  Edit This is not a comprehensive argument the picture is much more grand than this 
PoliticalDiscussion,You ve never had green people move into your neighborhood 
PoliticalDiscussion,Expanding health insurance will increase demand in some areas but people would still have to pay for a portion of their care We don t really know how affordable these health plans are going to be   Also it would reduce the price of care overall because people will actually have to pay for their care in advance No longer will hospitals be forced to eat the costs of uncompensated care The mandated insurance plans would spread the risk and make healthcare more affordable  These insurance plans will still have cost sharing just like any other health insurance plan The only think that will change is the plans will be subsidized by the government on a sliding scale and people with pre existing conditions will be able to get insurance I ll reserve my judgement until the plans are in action 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are what  million people who fall through that gap  Make enough that don t qualify for medicaid but don t get insurance through their employer  Getting individual insurance is sickeningly expensive if you can t get in some kind of group plan  
PoliticalDiscussion,Question directed to you because it seems as if you have a developed and educated opinion on the topic   I have a concealed firearm and am minding my own business in public let s say a bowling alley for example A fight between some men or women  does it matter breaks out someone is being repeatedly face stomped right next to me Do I have the right to bear my firearm in the defense of the man woman getting face stomped   I have no relation to either parties Is there a difference if I have a relation to one or both of the public parties 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama didn t touch the Bush tax cuts because every member of Congress plus most of their financial backing would suddenly be paying more and we just can t have that   
PoliticalDiscussion,Except if you can t afford coverage you can be placed in Medicaid which is basically a subsidized arena for those who can t afford  Paul Krugman explains it best to those who think that having mandates isn t significant or helpful   
PoliticalDiscussion,If you are a socially conservative Libertarian it would be party time 
PoliticalDiscussion,What country 
PoliticalDiscussion,People dont commit as many crimes 
PoliticalDiscussion,While I would support this it is not that simple Expanding the already most expensive program on the books that currently only covers a portion of the population to the entire  million of the population is easier said than done 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was just posting info about price controls I m not an economist but I try to understand some of the more basic concepts for fun Wikipedia has a relatively poor entry for the  history   History on maximum wages and I don t know much about it    This article says that it could lead to labor shortages in certain fields because the lower salary would increase demand and decrease the number of workers available with a particular skill set                                                                                 Here s a poll showing that most economists think executives are overpaid      gt Here s the effect of the mandatory shareholder voting on executive compensation   gt In the  proxy season shareholders at the large companies voting on executive compensation approved the described compensation in a large majority of cases According to ISS   shareholders voted to approve executive compensation in   of the cases reported   Among S P  companies eight failed to receive shareholder approval for their compensation decisions Within the Russell  Index  companies failed to receive shareholder approval According to ISS negative votes at  of these companies were due to pay for performance concerns At half of these companies the vote was attributed to double digit negative three year total shareholder returns At other companies it appears that the negative vote was motivated at least in part by awards of tax gross ups   discretionary bonuses to executives benchmarking of awards with inappropriate peer companies   excessive pay and failure to address significant opposition to compensation committee members in the past   source                                                                                       I got it from this guy in another thread    He also said   gt What is not clear is whether people are good at identifying effective management before hiring it or evaluating the worth of that management once it has been hired The research literature on this subject is far from conclusive If teams  or corporations overestimate their ability to evaluate management they will end up overpaying   gt However the general belief of academic economists is that executives are probably overpaid Some reasons include the  winner s curse in auctions and the realist concern that in practice people aren t committed to the  maximization of shareholder value     so those are some of the reasons executives are overpaid I m comfortable with the idea of a progressive tax policy but I find the idea of a maximum wage kind of disturbing At the same time I don t understand how people can justify their value to companies when they are making so much money  Maybe it s just because of the current status quo but the minimum wage doesn t seem like a justification to create a maximum wage The first one protects workers and ensures a basic wage   which if we re honest isn t even high enough to really support yourself The second one is about preventing companies from hiring people at their desired wage Somehow I don t think it would really stabilize our economy or improve company performance I like the new mandatory shareholder voting mechanism It will be interesting to see if that stabilizes or lowers executive compensation over time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Absolutely nothing  My point was that Trayvon having been   suspended from school   a big deal for a  year old school is your ENTIRE life has to do with Trayvon being agitated enough to break Zimmerman s nose and pummling him to the ground      I m not saying this is what happened Its completely hypothetical but cant you at least entertain the possibility this is what happened  He was a fast growing  year old boy with teenage hormones raging   Trayvon did break the guys nose   Do you think Zimmerman really provoked that legitimately    Or was Trayvon at least a little bit on edge that night too because of what had happened recently in his personal life   If Zimmerman was the initial physical aggressor how d a  year old boy get the jump on him and end up on top  The suspension from school for a completely bullshit reason  in his mind could have influenced trayvons behavior when he otherwise would not have punched a confrontational stranger in the face    Its an unfortunate combination of unrelated events but does it not at least seem somewhat plausible  Am I completely off base  Why would Trayvon not only punch the guy in the nose BUT ALSO get on top of him and start pummeling AND smashing his head into the ground  Why wouldn t he just punch him in the nose and run   I m not trying to say this justifies what Zimmerman did  he still should have been arrested even if he was found innocent  but it does allow you to have a bit of sympathy for both sides   BOTH of them acted like idiots from the evidence that has come out in the last few days IMO  It ll be interesting to see what comes out when the investigation is complete 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Burden of proof is on Zimmerman to prove he didn t hit Martin first  I m pretty sure the burden of proof is on the State to prove that a murder occured  Sure you ve got a dead body but you also have a shooter with a plausible claim of self defense with visible wounds on his face and head and at least  witness corraborating his version of the events  With the heavy burden of proof required in capital crimes  y know  innocent until proven guilty and all that  it s not hard to see why a police force would conclude that they cannot get a conviction in this case 
PoliticalDiscussion,nothing good 
PoliticalDiscussion,I said they re  not perfect and probably not perfectly thought out  If i thought it was perfect I would ve put it in  r politics  r politics  thats y im in  r PoliticalDiscussion  r PoliticalDiscussion  to have a discussion

PoliticalDiscussion,In the first  paragraphs you just destroyed about  military jobs plus another   high paying civilian jobs Let s not forget that you ve seriously crippled defense contracting firms like Raytheon McDonnel Douglas and Boeing   What happens if you don t graduate grade  Do you take their birthday away How does forcing someone to complete  years of schooling make us smarter If a  year degree is now essentially free who pays the salary of professors Who pays for infrastructure Why does a degree from Harvard cost more than a degree from New Mexico State Quality of professors If all professors are going to be paid the same and essentially going to be glorified high school teachers you won t exactly be attracting top minds into acadamia My question is how does this lead to a  smarter society Would handing out college degrees make us a  more educated society Why not I mean if  of the population has a  year degree    TSA and DEA   say buh bye to another million jobs  Thou shalt not kill Is murder considered  a religious law  Lying Cheating Stealing    gt Our founding fathers did not intend for us to own Barret  cals that can shoot down planes when they said right to bear arms That s different  How do you know What if I want to live in NYC and have a time share in Alaska Do I have to store my  cal in Alaska What if criminals resort to wearing body armor Can I expect a  to still stop them  Health Care Costs Because fuck doctors and the extensive monetary and time costs they invested in learning their craft Are health care costs out of control Yes absolutely Is a vasectomy something I want to go  lowest bidder on Fuck no  Overall it sounds like you want to create a nanny state You also seem to think that a college education is equal to well educated It seems that you haven t thought out what happens if someone doesn t toe the line  not finishing school what are the ramifications how to you  force someone to finish something they don t want to do and have forgotten how many jobs are tied to shitty alphabet soup government organizations    Finish your Sophmore year of college and write again   
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow just wow 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Following the money on this article is so easy even Dubya could figure it out  Pretty sure Dubya is a hell of a lot smarter than you   Also if you didn t know the Cato institute is very independent from the Koch brothers and is fighting to stay that way Good job on your detective work 
PoliticalDiscussion,But he did get away  He was gone and   came back  to give Zimmerman an asskicking  
PoliticalDiscussion,Except for tax breaks for the rich and gutting of social services 
PoliticalDiscussion,there is equal evidence on both sides I think there might be more witnesses that help Trayvon s case   The bottom line Z could of said or even touched Martin before turning to leave Only Z knows for sure There is no reason he would of believed Trayvon about why he was there      Burden of proof is on Zimmerman to prove he didn t hit Martin first     Sick of these goons getting away   baited breath gleefully in pursuit                       COP FRIEND OF ZIMMERMAN  IF you want to shoot someone and get away with it just remember to make sure they hit you a few times first  a broken nose is perfect  then aim for body mass  a dead man doesn t tell his side 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like this is stating the obvious but you can t have a national discussion about anything In order for anything intellectual to ascend to  national level it must first be politicized and political discussions aren t really discussions They re just shit flinging It becomes about  winning  rather than understanding  To put this in realer more personal terms Most here are probably liberals yes Do you not on occasion watch Jon Stewart and see him strawman the other side s argument Just on occasion Everything political is about winning 
PoliticalDiscussion, what capitalism means    Strangely most people seem to think it has something vaguely to do with  capital    gt So being anti state doesn t qualify you as an anarchist  Well as far I m concerned you re not really anti state You just want to hand the authority over to unaccountable tyrants and call it private   mercenaries not police etc But no it does not qualify you as an anarchist Loosely speaking opposing all forms of tyranny does  Also most anarchists have been pro government since government can be stateless     This isn t something I just dreamed up today 
PoliticalDiscussion,Notice too  distribution and exchange of wealth   gt also no not really an anarchist   some cowardly strain of pacifist  So being anti state doesn t qualify you as an anarchist  Perhaps you d do well to read some dictionary definitions yourself  Definition a person who advocates the abolition of government and a social system based on voluntary cooperation  anarchist  n d   Collins English Dictionary  Complete   Unabridged th Edition   Gasp 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t there funding mandates at the national level 
PoliticalDiscussion,figure out what  capital means and why we use that word instead of just  stuff  also no not really an anarchist    some cowardly strain of pacifist  plenty of slaves rarely have any violence used against them for example
PoliticalDiscussion,An abortion is the women s right until the actual birth in the case you used the abortion isn t the controversy it s the blackmailing that is I wouldn t be surprised if a similar thing happens with custody of young children 
PoliticalDiscussion,Health care is expensive because of over regulation govt spending and manipulations of price and govt regulation that stifles competition  basically the govt has created a cartel of providers that have the govt keeping competition out for them  Not to mention the govt is also telling them to raise their prices in order to cover everything Which is ironic because as soon as the govt takes over the system the govt will NOT pay for the expensive services Especially on the elderly You can see that already in Britain with the NHS denying the elderly hip replacement and eye surgery 
PoliticalDiscussion,When you expect demagoguery it s what you will find  There are plenty of intelligent people who are perfectly capable of having an intelligent and  mostly un biased discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You and you only because if you check the dictionary that is not what it means  Definition an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production distribution and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state owned means of wealth   gt  I don t have no ruler if he don t come from the gubment is not an anarchist position sorry   I don t have no ruler unless he uses violence against me and my property is more like it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Stand Your Ground Laws have always been controversial in Florida for this exact reason if the evidence comes to support it I m also sure it s not the only case of SYG being abused just the most notorious case 
PoliticalDiscussion,Putting everyone in the country on one health care plan gives that plan tremendous bargaining power ove the price of health care  If a doctor decided to turn down people on a given plan they d be shutting themselves off to the entire country  Thus if the government provided a plan that everyone in the country was a part of  or if they were the  single payer  they d be able to offer extremely low reimbursement rates without sacrificing coverage  This effect has been well documented in most other developed nations  I should say that I don t support single payer health care but I accept the premise that a single payer plan would greatly reduce health costs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep hammering that it s a human right and eventually it will be accepted as such  Also keep asking for more and more entitlements  If you ask for ten things maybe you ll get five but at least you got more than nothing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Is there anything left we can have a  national discussion about Anything not reduced to partisan bickering will be quickly drowned out by something that can be if not deliberately steered in that direction   Maybe I m wrong I m just feeling cynical for some reason today 
PoliticalDiscussion,You use the term  debunked too loosely  I d be more comfortable with  argued against   You re probably unfamiliar with the  RAND Health Insurance Experiment   but it provides empirical backing to the idea of moral hazard in health care  This is the consensus view among health economists  BTW trusting Malcolm Gladwell over health economists makes about as much sense as trusting David Koch over climate scientists 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think if matters much The majority of people without insurance really do want insurance With the subsidies and exchange they should be able to get it The people who will remain belligerently uninsured will be a very small number   And the  bucks a year they d otherwise pay in penalties won t matter Let s say million people remain uninsured out of spite   That gives us a  coverage rate which is pretty damn good     And who s most likely to stay uninsured  year olds who d rather not pay for insurance right Well they can stay on their parents policy longer now so I really do see the loss of the mandate as being a moot point if the subsidies are generous enough
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The way we define capitalism is the state where people may homestead unowned scrace goods and have the right to keep contractually acquired scarce goods  You and you  only  because if you check the dictionary that is not what it means   gt We take it to be the broader anti state sense   Nar row er  Hilariously unbelievably myopically narrower    I don t have no ruler if he don t come from the gubment is not an anarchist position sorry 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  issue of votes was present the moment he took office Even though there were technically  Dems in the Senate Ted Kennedy was on his deathbed as was Robert Byrd Then there was Leiberman who pledged to join the Repubs in a blockage  because insurance giant CIGNA is in his home state   So while he campaigned FOR The public option it was never actually going to be possible in Congress despite the supposed  seats the Dems had 
PoliticalDiscussion,yeah keep thinking that   and rumsfeld wolfowitz bolton kristol etc  all part of dubya s inner circle had no influence on dubya s needless war in iraq after they petitioned clinton to use military action to dethrone saddam back in the s     people s affliations have NO influence on their opinions  keep thinking that and i have some WMDs and forged obama birth certificate to show you 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is  empirical evidence   that people demand more health care when the price is low  So expanding health insurance likely would increase the amount of health care demanded  The effect you re describing would likely take place if insurance pools were bigger as those pools would then be able to bargain prices down  which is the main benefit of single payer systems   As far as I know that isn t really the case in PPACA 
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t there already an existing bureaucracy  Medicare billing or whatever that can just be expanded 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you aware that racism does still exist and needs to be dealt with  Heres tim wise with an excellent article about the lie of post racism   
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah I posted about this article I remember it specifically because the journalist had no idea what he was talking about here is what I said in the comments section   gt In America Medicare and Medicaid negotiate prices on behalf of their tens of millions of members and not coincidentally purchase care at a substantial markdown from the commercial average But outside that it s a free for all Providers largely charge what they can get away with often offering different prices to different insurers and an even higher price to the uninsured  Wow How in the fuck does a major news publication get away with this joke that they call  journalism  There are so many things wrong with this statement  especially the last part   I m an auditor in the healthcare industry and routinely audit hospitals and other medical providers all across my state I m not an expert on contracting management but I know enough about it to know that whoever wrote this article doesn t know what the fuck they re talking about and is either ignorantly or intentionally misinforming readers  Firstly lets talk about Medicare Medicaid and other government payers and provider  negotiations  I put  negotiations in quotes because to call them that is a joke Providers  especially hospitals have little to no wiggle room with these payers Basically the government comes in and says  this is what we think we should be charged for for this particular service this is not considered medically necessary you can t bill the patient for this you have to do this you can t do this etc etc   and if you don t like it than you can t be contracted with us  The problem is Medicare and Medicaid make up for a HUGE portion of insured individuals  the one thing pointed out in this paragraph that s actually correct  so no large provider in their right mind is going to drop them If they did they would lose thousands of patients to other providers and inevitably go out of business  Now concerning commercial insurers there is actually room to negotiate but it is FAR from providers being able to charge whatever they want Again you have huge commercial payers like Blue Cross UHC Aetna etc that most likely represent a large portion of a provider s local community So providers and payers are going to work very diligently to negotiate costs they both agree on to insure all of those people can receive in network costs at the provider  as that s best for both parties involved   Next lets talk about how providers come up with pricing Different providers negotiate with payers in different terms and contracts are written in different ways for different services  case rates percentage of charges etc   but typically in network rates are well below  of the actual billed amount That means that when you get a bill for an MRI of      that s  not actually what it costs nor is it what the hospital expects to be paid You see a LOT goes into the calculation of this amount what the actual operating costs of the MRI would be what the average commercial payer would pay for it what Medicare will pay for what they can expect someone without insurance to pay for etc etc so that it can all balance out to where they cover the amount of the service pay their employees and stay out of the red    TL DR   Yes it s a messy system and has tons of problems but this article lacks a valid argument and the journalist should have studied up on contract management before spewing out this inaccurate garbage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately the average person does not have enough knowledge to determine what procedures are aren t necessary I actually majored in Biology at a bigtime state school and I would have no idea what lab work should or shouldn t be done in any given scenario So how could a layman or an elderly person or a foreigner who barely understands English  know enough to pick and choose what is legitimate  Secondly try calling a hospital some time and getting a cost estimate ahead of time Johns Hopkins here in Baltimore for example has a strict policy AGAINST this So for your idea to work we would need some kind of legislation to force transparency regarding costs Any ideas on how to make that work 
PoliticalDiscussion,How is his girlfriend a credible witness    Of course no witnesses will come forward corraborating Zimmerman s claims when the New Black Panther Party is putting bounties on peoples heads 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah because the writings of an op ed article couldn t possibly just be the opinion of the person writing it   I like conspiracies like this They make so much more sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,I read the brief explanation and don t understand why I got the  wtf  learn history   I live in a country with minimum wage why can t we implement some form of maximum wage  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the best thing about the law is the Health Insurance Exchanges which I don t think are going anywhere Getting rid of the mandate will mean less people are initially insured but the exchanges will make it easier for people to get insured so that will help 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps indeed Let me ask you a question if everybody is dissatisfied with the government  and everyone re elects incumbents over and over again how could it be said that the voters are holding anyone accountable Isn t that the opposite of accountability  Further not every position in government is subject to election The heads of federal departments are called  czars  
PoliticalDiscussion,There is an article I want you to read consider here is a few excerpts   gt  Americans don t see the doctor more often or stay longer in the hospital than residents of other countries Quite the opposite actually We spend less time in the hospital than Germans and see the doctor less often than the Canadians   gt  In  of  cases Americans are paying higher prices than residents of other developed countries Usually we re paying quite a bit more The exception is cataract surgery which appears to be costlier in Switzerland though cheaper everywhere else   gt   Other countries negotiate very aggressively with the providers and set rates that are much lower than we do  Anderson says They do this in one of two ways In countries such as Canada and Britain prices are set by the government In others such as Germany and Japan they re set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail   gt  Two of the five most profitable industries in the United States  the pharmaceuticals industry and the medical device industry  sell health care With margins of almost  percent they beat out even the financial sector for sheer profitability   gt  The health insurers  are not so profitable In  their profit margins were a mere  percent That s a signal that the sellers have the upper hand over the buyers   gt  Many researchers are skeptical that this is an effective way to fund medical innovation  We pay twice as much for brand name drugs as most other industrialized countries  Anderson says  But the drug companies spend only  percent of their revenues on innovation So yes some of that money goes to innovation but only  percent of it    Why an MRI costs   in America and  in France    washingtonpost com
PoliticalDiscussion,You re confusing socialism with welfare statism We don t have  and I hope you don t want collective farms and state run grocery stores Instead the government gives poor people a voucher so that they may buy food on the market aka food stamps We could have something very similar for health care 
PoliticalDiscussion,I certainly agree with this whole heartedly but even still some of these numbers are just absurd  I don t have a background in politics or history or economics  I m a biologist  so a brain wired for logical analysis goes into seizure seeing the salaries and bonuses of people responsible for nuking companies  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s easy to avoid the penalty just enroll for coverage Anyone who can t afford coverage on their own should be eligible for Medicaid or other assistance subsidies anyway so it s not like this is penalizing the poor who can afford neither the penalty nor the cost of coverage This is only putting the hurt on irresponsible tightwads who can afford coverage but chose to keep that money instead when they suffer a catastrophic accident or illness or let their health deteriorate because they avoided preventive care the rest of us are left paying for at least the cost of their unpaid ER bills and perhaps their SSI disability support and or chronic health care once they re eligible for Medicare 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yer lookin at one of the veins for it  If there was a way that the various fragments of forums such as  r politics  r politics and places like redstate to have a give and take with people both  sides agree that may not represent everything they believe in but are honest brokers that can be relied upon to stick up for their side and do so in an intelligent and honest manner  It doesn t mean the various factions will come to resolution doesn t mean that there won t be hurt feelings because something they say is misunderstood but the point is to continue the engagement with others who disagree with one another   The internet does allow for more of a democratized flow of information and progression of discourse imperfect as it is   I sometimes wish  r PoliticalDiscussion  r PoliticalDiscussion was able to act as a nexus of sites like Alternet and Redstate combing the comment forums and bringing the most novel ideas from the various perspectives on a given topic or issue and then we could chew over them and debate their pitfalls and merits We re not perfect here of course but even just aspiring and failing at such a prospective is a worthy cause 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We re talking about a social contract here in abstract terms  No there is no social contract not even in abstract terms The reality is as I have shown that the government has zero legal obligation to protect you or provide you with any benefits 
PoliticalDiscussion,hmmm I d like to think that it does Perhaps I just refuse to believe that my vote means basically nothing even though thats the reality of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sure Zimmerman is a whiny cunt and possibly mentally ill But unless you can prove that he wasn t acting in self defense at the moment he pulled the trigger it s awfully tough to convict him of murder  Is there any reason why you put more stock into this eyewitness account than others which indicate that Zimmerman was getting his ass kicked and screaming for help 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I totally get what you mean loopholes will exist when we are talking about just an idea in its raw form  Another stipulation would be that the employee pool only includes jobs located in the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,I humbly submit that the federal solution has created a good bit of hostility as well Additionally the states rights that you re not a fan of are granted that way for a reason  to allow a few intrepid states like Vermont to introduce single payer healthcare and demonstrate its benefits to the country at large 
PoliticalDiscussion,It may be Zimmerman s fault that the confrontation occurred and ended in Martin s death but that doesn t necessarily mean he s guilty of murder or even manslaughter 
PoliticalDiscussion,The cost of unpaid ER bills is currently covered by raising costs on everyone else If the individual mandate is overturned I think we ll have to settle on an entitlement program as a default fallback recourse   i e  if you re a citizen without private or employer provided coverage you d automatically be covered by Medicare Medicaid even without having had to enroll for it beforehand  No insurance  enrolled for Medicare Medicaid on the spot 
PoliticalDiscussion,We inch forward toward a goal we re already  years overdue on achieving single payer federally funded health insurance that covers every US citizen from birth to death regardless of intranational residence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why The Canadian healthcare system is mainly done at the provincial level 
PoliticalDiscussion,The religious right republicans I don t like them Also the Birthers   I hates em  Thankfully their candidates of choice either didn t bother to run  because they know how bad they would lose  Palin Huckabee  were drummed out of the race  Bachman   Perry  or are currently making themselves a laughingstock by their insistence that their   is the  entire party and that they can somehow beat Romney  Gingrich and Santorum  
PoliticalDiscussion,I started voting in  I decided to do this shortly after  when I did not like the way the Democrats were trying to re count democrat heavy districts in Florida to steal the election from George Bush I decided every vote  really does count 
PoliticalDiscussion,Having  different plans is bad  Its going to create a lot of hostility balkanization just as if every state had their own immigration policy  I m actually not a state s rights guy  We d be much better off without the th amendment    The best thing would be national single payer  However since that is not a realistic political outcome we have to do things in a very inefficient and not so great way  Once single payer has spread to enough states they can be merged into regional and then finally a national plan  It is however the best option in that it is the only one that seems viable currently 
PoliticalDiscussion,   Police report lists him as  flat and  
PoliticalDiscussion,Simply put if health coverage can t be a mandate it has to become an entitlement If we can t make everyone obtain coverage on their own then some form of coverage has to be provided as at least a default fallback recourse as an inherent right of citizenship   i e  if you don t have private or employer provided coverage you d automatically be covered under something like Medicaid or Medicare even without having pre enrolled for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Literally nothing will work with a GOP house 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But it s not hindsight There was a dude walking thru the neighborhood Zimmerman s paranoid self  I mean how many times did he call the police     saw something that wasn t there It s legal to walk thru a neighborhood No crime was being committed  Plus put yourself in Martin s shoes If someone was following you home at  PM on a rainy night might you too decide to run   Sure  You can have two people acting in an entirely rational manner that leads to tragedy in situations where there is incomplete information     gt  Reasonable people call the cops if they see something suspicious   And Zimmerman did call the police immediately   gt They don t confront the guy I m not even confronting the guy if he s stealing something  and not just I suspect it I mean if I see him climbing out of a busted window with some electronics  I m going to be a good witness because my life is not worth my own Xbox much less somebody else s  Xbox   It s not clear the Zimmerman actually confronted the guy  The  official story is that Zimmerman attempted to follow lost sight of Martin and then proceeded back to his vehicle and was intercepted in turn by Martin  The only thing we know for certain is that Zimmerman was following Martin at one point  Not that he initiated a confrontation  unless you assert that following is in and of itself initiating a confrontation  
PoliticalDiscussion,What if on the contrary stream of consciousness where precisely what were in order Do you see what I mean 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Besides it s not as if private corporations are also immune from corruption and graft Happens all the time  Corporations that let graft get in the way of the bottom line go out of business  Government faces no such discipline   gt Because corruption is not unfixable  Then fix it  If you manage that then I ll trust you to run my life but not before 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a known fake coming from the very active smear campaign   The original  source   of the pic has already made that correction     But thanks for spreading the word 
PoliticalDiscussion,I doubt anything happens this year The elections will be a mandate from voters on which direction we should take My guess is President Obama will push for a further expansion of Medicaid assuming the SCOTUS leaves ACA Medicaid expansion untouched as the only viable path forward If we don t want to regulate the insurance industry to do these things and we understand they can t afford to pay for it themselves without a broader base then what other options do we have left Medicaid for anyone with pre existing conditions a Medicaid eligibility to cover the new gap of   Medicaid eligibility for anyone who exceeds their life time spending cap etc   If Romney wins in November he will continue pushing the Republican alternative of doing absolutely nothing It s been more than  years now and the Republican party has not put forward a coherent alternative   in large part because their alternative  was the individual responsibility mandate They just don t have a plan I don t see them developing one in the next  months I think the administration in the original development of ACA had a Plan A Plan B Plan C etc so they are likely to have something new ready to go before the election   For what it s worth I don t think the SCOTUS will drop the individual responsibility mandate I think both Roberts and Kennedy will go for it At the end of the day the constitution does not explicitly say you can t do it and has enough of wiggle room to suggest you can do it Roberts I m not as sure about but Kennedy is an old timer I don t think he has the idealogical zeal required to undermine the legislative branch unless he has a very good justification If the argument against the individual responsibility mandate boils down to  it s different and  feels wrong that s just not enough for him in my opinion I also think he threw out the whole slippery slope argument today by acknowledging the insurance industry is unique 
PoliticalDiscussion,I never liked the individual mandate because it doesn t actually do any good  The people that can t afford insurance now just face a   or whatever tax penalty  Big whoop  They still can t afford coverage  I look at it this way if you want to help small businesses take the burden of health insurance off their backs  People with great business ideas can start their own companies without fear of losing coverage  Small companies will be better able to compete with larger ones for employees  If a person gets sick and loses their job they can still be treated get healthy and go back to work  
PoliticalDiscussion,There will be no Discussion  There will be a period of National Patience in which the people of reason wait for the people of ignorance to die off  This period started with the first morphological disagreements between Homo sapiens and it will end with the extinction of Homo sapiens 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  tomorrow Vermont can start implementing the single payer bill  I m convinced that the best option for doing this right is on a state by state basis  Can anyone convince me that that s a bad idea 
PoliticalDiscussion,With no preventive or ongoing care many of the people that go to the emergency room will wind up going back again and again with the same problems   Broken leg   Go to emergency room   They stabilize patient with a splint and push them out the door   Bone doesn t heal properly   Bone breaks again return to step  but with additional injury and an infection    Unless we re willing to let people die when they can t pay for treatment then the only thing that makes sense is a system that covers everyone  Preventative medicine is far less expensive than emergency care  A decent diagnosis and a little good advice is all the care that most people need and that can be done by a competent nurse rather than a doctor most of the time  Get free public care that is focused on getting the best ROI  healing the most people for the least money   Let people who want to be covered in case they have rare or very difficult diseases buy private insurance or pay for themselves  We can have annual shouting matches about whether some disease or other should be covered or not based on how much it costs  If someone needs  of medicine then no problem  If they need    of medicine not so much  
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually you can go to most European universities paying the same as locals providing you get in which can be difficult due to a language barrier therecmay not be  free tuition but I never said there was I said that the American system is overpriced to students and fees alone don t mean a successful university and so replying to the OP yes it is viable to have affordable higher education
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Just  of the patients in the U S account for fifty percent of all health care costs  mostly the chronically ill  and taking care of these catastrophic illnesses is what drives up American costs  I fully believe this I have someone in my family that s chronically ill and the amount of procedures tests and surgeries is shocking 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Healthcare is never free but many people in this country can t or won t pay for it That s the problem The system you described is basically what we do now and it doesn t work  It doesn t work now because ER s can t refuse people for lack of means to pay  It fucks up the whole model  I m only saying this from the perspective of  controlling costs   This would control costs immensely but leave poor people to die on the street  From a moral standpoint we re stuck having to treat poor people regardless of who is paying for it   this means we all pay for it  Single payer or not  
PoliticalDiscussion,well you training mice to run in litte generator wheels or if you are really clever you use that  yr old invention  batteries   to store the generated electricity and use it when YOU want 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re essentially making a supply demand argument from  moral hazard and  tragedy of the commons bases which in regards to the market for health care has been debunked by  Malcolm Gladwell here   and more recently by  Fareed Zakaria here  
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t it be cheaper and more efficient to provide preventative medicine  for everyone   It s expensive to manage people s health problems from an ER setting If everyone has access to primary care necessary medications and other basic care then the ER can be used for its intended purpose   medical emergencies   Healthcare is never free but many people in this country can t or won t pay for it That s the problem The system you described is basically what we do now and it doesn t work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Say  k  Where I am  Canada so not directly comparable if you make  k you are in a  bracket and they go up to    It costs the government  in revenue to give a  k writeoff to a  poor person and  in revenue to give that same writeoff to a  rich person  It would be vastly preferable in my opinion if the government is going to commit to spending money on healthcare  and tax write offs  are spending to spend more money on the poor than the rich 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please do get that ass ache checked out  If you let it progress until you have a full blown debilitating ass attack insured people and taxpayers are going to end up picking up the tab 
PoliticalDiscussion,Define communo define syndicalist and if they match the description you provide you re good to go  The way we define capitalism is the state where people may homestead unowned scrace goods and have the right to keep contractually acquired scarce goods  The state is an institutionalized monopoly on the initiation of aggression against property  which includes the self   We do not define anarchy as  anti hierarchy  Some do We take it to be the broader anti state sense 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Force me to buy insurance and I m am going to get every possibly ass ache I have checked out  Which is exactly the point By making routine preventive care universally accessible and affordable treatable conditions will be discovered and corrected early while they re still cheap and easy to treat before they develop into more severe and or chronic conditions requiring vastly more expensive and possibly ongoing treatment and which may put the citizen on permanent disability support if their deteriorated health has rendered them unable to work  As Fareed Zakaria  recently wrote     gt  Just  of the patients in the U S account for fifty percent of all health care costs    mostly the chronically ill  and taking care of these catastrophic illnesses is what drives up American costs  This is the real reason Obama made healthcare reform such a priority it was one of the biggest single budget slashing measures he could propose that stood a chance of actually passing as it alleviates the costs borne by Medicare Medicaid and SSI when the uninsured leave treatable conditions untreated which then develop into chronic severe debilitating conditions not to mention the distributed costs of ER visits that go unpaid by the uninsured costs which therefore have to be covered by raising costs on everyone else All of us  already are indirectly paying the costs of healthcare for the uninsured just in the least effective least efficient least expedient least direct manner imaginable 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea with the mandate is that there isn t any such thing as non participation in the health care market  Regardless of whether or not I buy insurance I will still get health care should I be struck by a horrible accident or a disease or something  The analogy doesn t quite work for me because child care is fundamentally quite different from insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You never asked   gt How does not having a mandate to purchase healthcare hurt our freedom         Do you not read or something   gt health care is something that must be provided whether you can pay for it or not  No it isn t    gt They can not turn you away at the hospital  They can make you leave    gt And since the people who are paying for insurance are forced to pay for the people who aren t their is a special situation here  So what for it being special Where does the authority in the constitution come from How does this limit my freedom Second Justice Alito would disagree with you on your special situation   gt What is amazing to me is that this is an entirely republican idea They wanted it until Obama decided they were right Then they decided no we don t want it This position is so republican and it amazes me they have the gall to come out against it They are the ones that are usually crying when someone we have to pay for someone else Damn hippies on welfare Where are those cries now  Yes the Republicans are wrong and yes it is a beautiful red herring you just made there       
PoliticalDiscussion,When elections no longer matter and not because the people aren t participating but when it becomes apparent that the government is manipulating them to give the illusion of democracy I know a lot of people think we are there already but I am not one of them Any revolution before that point would involve a minority stripping the power away from the majority and I don t think that is acceptable   I guess my answer would be armed revolution becomes acceptable when a majority of Americans support it but I personally can t imagine that activism at that level wouldn t have already manifested itself in the voting booth making armed revolution unnecessary 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know that Gladwell mentioned it and I have the awful impression that he never actually read RAND s study because the actual findings were the exact opposite of what he reported  In fact higher co payments were associated with reduced health expenditures regardless of the procedure  People didn t discriminate between expensive and inexpensive procedures they just demanded less of everything Further RAND found that health outcomes weren t significantly affected by the level of insurance that people were given     Kaiser did a good write up of the study  here   or you can read the original  here   though it s pretty wonkish  If you are trying to argue that moral hazard doesn t exist when it comes to health care you need to be aware of a couple things   You don t have any data to support it and  if you found data to support it you d win a Nobel Prize 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eugenics implies the use of force  There s nothing about my comment that implies the use of force 
PoliticalDiscussion,You never asked   You damn well what the answer is    that is if you watched any of the news coverage in the last two days And that is what is to be decided But since you are playing dumb  I ll assume you are playing  health care is something that must be provided whether you can pay for it or not They can not turn you away at the hospital And since the people who are paying for insurance are forced to pay for the people who aren t their is a special situation here   What is amazing to me is that this is an entirely republican idea They wanted it until Obama decided they were right Then they decided no we don t want it  This position is so republican and it amazes me they have the gall to come out against it They are the ones that are usually crying when someone we have to pay for someone else Damn hippies on welfare Where are those cries now 
PoliticalDiscussion,In the whole state but no such recount ever would of taken place If the recount was given by the supreme court Bush still would of won it didn t matter   You also never told me how me not being forced to buy something limits my freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It was a  decision that said no recount could be made  That was the decision that cost Gore the election Gore was later found to have beat him by  votes 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was a  decision that the recount that was going to happen in Florida was unconstitutional It was a  decision that said no recount could be made Bush still would of won even with the recount that Gore wanted You would of had to recount the whole state for Gore to win 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would not mind living in this world at all  But making all states conform to this is not going to work lets break it up and Cascadia and New England can follow this model    My only addition would be that citizenship has obligations other than passing a test  You should be required to vote but a  no confidence vote would be on all ballots for all candidates so we don t have to pick the lesser of two evils   
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush v Gore was a  decision and with party affiliation And they didn t allow the recount Later it was found that Gore actually won Florida by  votes Had the recount occurred like it should Bush would not have had a second term Our president was chose by non elected people The court designed to proect our constitutional rights    actually stole them from us 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is an honest and thoughtful response so thanks for taking the time to type it out  On Medicare I think the only way Ryan will be taken seriously is if he can get a Dem on board to endorse sponsor his plan  sort of the way that McCain teamed up with Feingold to pass campaign finance reform   But because protecting Medicare is the holy grail of Democratic politics I m not hopeful this will happen  I understand your point about it being  a just and righteous program and I agree we should care for and support our elderly but we simply have to find a more sustainable way to pay for it because the current system will cease to exist on the current course  As for debt deficit spending I understand the dynamics of the bank bailout and why Bernanke pushed for it but I was actually referring more to the continual government spending like major entitlement programs created during the New Deal and Great Society eras  the welfare system   If we really want to stop ballooning deficits we need to also reform entitlements  The Republicans worked with Clinton in the s to reform welfare and it saved millions  if not billions   We need the same thing to happen again to stop our current deficit spending  The Ron Paul supporter in me also thinks we need to rein in defense spending too which is a dealbreaker for most Republicans  As for unions I appreciate your family s history in them and I too come from a family with members of local trades in the Northeast  I think unions were great for the bygone era  like the Great Depression era when job layoffs were cyclical and union reps provided you with your next paycheck  but in light of the globalization of our economy and the shift toward careers I think unions have become synonymous with protecting  the wrong people  as you said and not helping aspiring professionals to further their career  If you earn a college degree you earn it through your own hard work and not because someone else helped you get the job done  which is a common refrain of union workers  the idea of the  brotherhood    My main concern about unions is that they collect union dues and then use that money to contribute to Democratic campaigns in exchange for policies that are perceived to only benefit their own union  I think  Cash for Clunkers is a prime example of a union supporting a candidate  Obama and then getting something in return  Unfortunately it was a flop of a program and ended up pissing off car dealers and needlessly taking perfectly good cars off the road  Having said that I agree that most union workers are salt of the Earth the backbone of our economy  manufacturing trades etc  and generally hardworking people  My problem is with union bosses and I don t believe most union bosses act in the best interest of their workers let alone young voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t be so negative I m sure one type of Homo Sapien will win out and live in peace for a little bit before they find another way to sub divide themselves and go to war again 
PoliticalDiscussion,No we can not because white people have no concept of being black and all that it entails  Stereotypes cause preconceived notions and judgements regarding all things  The problem is that stereotypes exist for a reason and the times that such notions turn out to be true set race relations back that much further  Maybe someday  or  generations out when black males do not account for such a high  of overall crime  note this is not because they are black but more to do with sociological factors such as poverty and Affirmative Action is ended there can be a discussion  But until then any so called discussion will just be a waste of time 
PoliticalDiscussion,Maybe we can start with financial incentives for those on public assistance to produce no further children while on the dole  Eugenics ought to take into consideration inherent talent and ability and haleness of body rather than socio economic status 
PoliticalDiscussion,Erudition alone does not make one rich  A bit of the chicken and egg thing there also 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush V Gore  decision         I m so confused to what you are talking about How does not having a mandate to purchase healthcare hurt our freedom How is a mandate constitutional Citizens United was a free speech case Speech is broad and very protected Why is this one against freedom or the constitution either 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wow where to begin  Registered Dem conservative  yr old male  Democrats support Medicare for two reasons  it exists  and in the younger generation it has always been as far as they see and thus they want it and want it for their families  Let me explain a little more  Human nature is such that the day we are born our understanding of the world begins  The sentimentalist in us sees things that have been in our lives for their entirety as having always been and should always be  So we support them somewhat blindly in that regard  Many liberals see Medicare as a just and righteous program  we care about our elderly and they deserve to have health insurance and live long after   The problem that arises is that financially it is becoming quite a load to bear Most have  faith in health insurance companies  This view is somewhat warranted but not to the extent that people should be completely against any private enterprise in medicare  To the contrary it already exists in Medicare Coverage B  But change is scary and people are greedy manipulative and bad so Liberals tell Paul Ryan to blow it out his      Unjustified in my view  Something needs to be done about the increasing cost and inefficiency of our healthcare system  He has and idea and it should be discussed  Re debt deficit spending  W o this we would have had another depression in    It s that simple  Ben Bernanke s whole existence has been to study the effects of fiscal policy on the crash of   His reaction to our more recent recession has been a direct response to what did not work in the  s  immediate austerity and cutting government spending   Note that it remains to be seen if this  will work to bring us back to prosperity   will have any negative long term effects on our economic system  global integration   Lightning round  Solyndra political bullshit shouldn t have happened but ultimately not a huge deal  Stimulus  Government was the only thing large enough to prevent a depression  Spending  not enough btw to get the economy in a positive direction was really the only option beyond letting the entire western economic model come crashing down for a decade  though maybe all we did was kick the can down the road   Auto Bailouts  I believe we made a profit on those and GM is back on the road to prosperity  though with a UAW partial owner  perhaps a good thing   Deficit spending is a tough pill for me to swallow but economic collapse and uncertainty is much harder  Unions  I come from a union family  Dad municipal worker mom state  Mom says they are ok but protect the wrong people  Dad takes it a little further saying that concessions are needed when fiscal disaster looms  But make no mistake they are useful and make a better life for the average worker  Problem is the average worker is an asshole  Teacher unions are different  Last in first out sucks but it is policy for the same reason Tenure exists  to provide stability for what should be on of our most respected professions  Bad and lazy teachers give this system a horrid reputation  But if you had to have your contract renewed every two years what is to stop BOE s from firing you after  or  years when they have to pay you more for your masters and hire a new desperate for work college kid at   of your pay  The future success of our nation depends on the quality of our children  Why in gods name are we scapegoating the people who play an integral part of developing them  Cause   of them suck ass and game the system  People love to quote and talk about Finland and their education system  which is actually quite good but when they do they often forget to mention that teachers are respected and paid similar to engineers and nurses  Love talking about how we can make America s future brighter work with me here  
PoliticalDiscussion,I have no empathy for the faux authority that is the neighborhood watch program for many reasons But I wouldn t say its not ok for him to judge suspicious teenagers I only have a problem with him chasing them down and murdering them If he wants to sit in his car call the cops and make snide remarks then thats fine by me  A more substantial reason I m being judgmental of him is that he is a member of the neighborhood watch and a resident of a gated community something else I dislike at its core for more reasons I won t to digress into but I think many people can understand Also the background of the case describes him as someone who is overzealous in this job added to the fact that he was willing to take action into his own hands despite the advice of emergency services and the fact that he has a gun when so many more tools would be good substitutes  tasers for starters  I think any reasonable person would call this man a douchebag 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Both sides are corrupt both are only in it for their friends and campaign contributors  Which is exactly why the federal government should shrink   Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I should have actually titled this post  Young Americans Voting Against Their Own Economic Interests  not  Personal interests  For many liberal social policies are in someone s own personal interest  Sorry for the confusion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Employer provided insurance happens because they get big discounts for buying many many policies in large groups  I don t think its perverse either  Isn t that the whole idea that employers should be taking care of their employees  Isn t that what unions fight for  If it was cheaper then maybe individuals could buy it themselves more easily so they still have it if they lose their job  Then it comes down to how to make it cheaper  Free market types like myself would say open it up to more competition  To me a government provided healthcare isn t as desirable  Anything the government gives you they can take away  Everyone has experienced frustration with government whether it be at the state level  like the DMV who always tell you about some form you re missing or at the federal level  Imagine all the forms you d have to fill out the questions you d have to answer  It would turn your healthcare into a numbers game  The overwhelming percentage of a person s healthcare costs are spent in the last few years of their lives and when the government has a  finite amount of money to spend on healthcare per year some people just won t make the cut  Many of the same people who complain about the corrupt politicians and a government bought by lobbyists and corporations are the ones supporting that same government to be able to regulate our healthcare  That doesn t make sense to me  If it s so corrupt why give them more control 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course but once you put it in the computer it s consistent forever after  Again to go back to baseball imagine someone builds a calling machine  That machine will obviously be based on what the builder thinks should and shouldn t count as a strike  But after the machine is built everyone gets the same balls and same strikes with no bias  The important thing is the consistency not that the standard is  correct Consistent application of words after all is the very definition of rule of law   
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t honestly expect to have a legitimate unbiased discussion debate on anything when it s too taboo to even poke a bit of fun at it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The computer would have to be programmed to behave a certain way define certain words as meaning one thing but not another etc  Someone still needs to invent this  consistent standard   And because circumstances are always changing and new laws and new cases are always being considered the creation of a  consistent standard depends much more on  sta re decisis than on some fictitious objective interpretation of the document itself 
PoliticalDiscussion,So in this current battle    are they going to  interpret the healthcare law NO  All they will be able to do is upvote or downvote it or parts of it They do not get to interpret the law itself They say yes    or no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indeed  I value freedom and choice 
PoliticalDiscussion, The original argument against term limits and or elections for Justices was to keep the Court from becoming politicized   On top of that people are living longer Both Roberts Alito Sotomayor and Kagan are relatively young They could be on the court for another  years or more Kagan is only  With advancing medical technology she might be there for  or  more years Somehow that just doesn t seem right to me 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is the odd  or  decision but not often   In reality  at least the way the founding fathers intended reality to be there should be almost every time But sadly there is not 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think there is no consistent standard  There is no consistent standard because we have people doing the calling  But a computer is by definition a consistent standard  And at the end of the day all con law comes down to a binary choice of constitutional or not so it s all balls and strikes even though the justices go to great efforts to complicate things 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am afraid you have shown little  A single for profit video by the NRA regarding the necessity of firearms is hardly the resounding philosophical victory you trumpet it to be  Michelle brings up some good points beyond police protection  that may or may not exist   Tax money goes to many things  public roads parks fire departments public education  These are things that the majority of society has deemed worth everyone paying into in order to have  There may come a day where the majority feels that there should be no tax for public education or for fire protection  and that is fine  But until that day by living in the society that provides these things you have tacitly consented to whatever tax is needed to provide them  If you don t like it you can try to rally support for whatever cause you think would be best or you can leave  People like to get snarky and say that Somalia is a libertarian paradise but there are other places on earth that my be more to your liking than America   Of course the winds of change are blowing and who knows what will be left once they die down 
PoliticalDiscussion,But they have to interpret what the constitution says For example does a right to privacy include a women s right to an abortion Or what exactly does the well regulated militia clause of the second amendment imply In order the answer these questions they have to interpret the meaning of the sometimes vaguely worded constitution and apply it to laws never imagined by the founders 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt And in case of income taxes here is an example bob works the same amount of hours every day for  days income tax is  bob works through his th day for the next  days bob is working for free working without compensation is practically slavery  The logic here doesn t add up because Bob never actually works for free The income tax doesn t work like that Bob pays a  tax on all of the income he earns not a  tax on  of his income and a  tax on  of his income If he works for  minute he keeps  of the income and pays the other  in taxes Same if he works for  day If your example held up why wouldn t Bob just take the last  days off  the ones he is supposedly working for free and avoid paying taxes altogether It wouldn t work He would just be payed for  days with  of that going to the government At no time is he working for free 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I disagree  I think there is no consistent standard and the role of the justices actually is to set the standard  I think it s pretty rare that a case before the Supreme Court is simply a matter of being a ball or a strike  There is the odd  or  decision but not often 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You d be assuming quite a lot about Mr Zimmerman if you think he wouldn t hassle any other teenager walking around at night through a gated community with his hood up The cops on the other hand    So it s not ok for Zimmerman to judge Trayvon based on how he looked and dressed but it is ok to judge Zimmerman on the grounds he was neighborhood watch  That s an odd logic 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps our values differ somewhat  By your leave I disengage  Without your leave I reject your pity 
PoliticalDiscussion,Futurepast is right but also family law is almost entirely handled by state governments not federal and the challenge to obamacare is about FEDERAL power  They are not trying to strike down the mandate in Massachusetts 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If ACA goes down tomorrow Vermont can start implementing the single payer bill they signed last year  That would be nice though I m sure VT will take a lot of shit for it if they even try  The change is going to have to be bottom up  America is on board with over  supporting a real public option  The obstacle is the politicians   Yes pretty much all of them   Just saying Vermont  and a few other progressive states would not be able to do it alone  And then the Rush Limbaugh assholes will start up campaigns to bus chronically ill people to Vermont to drag the program under   Not a joke this apparently happened with regard to the treatment of homeless people  
PoliticalDiscussion,Drugs are actually the MOST cost effective part of the healthcare system by a vast margin  Literally orders of magnitude  pills cost billions of dollars to develop but they are vastly cheaper than doctors nurses MRI machines and hospital beds and do much more to improve quality of life 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt My guess is that they ll either go back and try for public option  Who is  they           It was Obama  and the Democrats in collusion who  undercut the public option in    of the public was on board  We could have had it if our politicians hadn t sold us out 
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually with a Republican House and Democrat Senate and Presidency it is party time no new laws passed is fantastic for actual libertarians   Sadly though both parties seem to agree on perpetual war so that will always continue   gt socially conservative Libertarian  Not sure what that is You mean like a libertarian who is socially conservative on a personal level What does that matter so long as they don t want to legislate their views and force it on others That kind of thing is decidedly un libertarian so the term would be an oxymoron in that case 
PoliticalDiscussion,But they do not interpret the law Plain and simple They can only uphold the law or reject it using the confines of the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,They interpret the Constitution s meaning and relate it to the issue at hand 
PoliticalDiscussion,A  year old man with a gun killed a  year old kid armed only with his fists  There is more than enough evidence to show that it was instigated by the  year old man with a gun  I m sure it s possible that the high schooler was agitated before all this happened but what carries more weight here   Whether or not the kid s feelings were hurt that he got suspended from school or whether or not he s dead 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I do believe we need that human element  i e  I would not want to replace SCOTUS with a computer program  Why not  If i could write a good enough program this is absolutely what I would do  The purpose of judges to to call balls and strikes according to some consistent standard not to set the standard  A computer does this perfectly  It takes in queries and spits out the same yes or no answer regardless of who asks  If people don t like the answer they can legislate a change  Really it s an ideal system 
PoliticalDiscussion,Didn t the Social Security Trust Fund help pay for the Korean War 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wouldn t hate the green people if they weren t subhuman scum who killed my dog 
PoliticalDiscussion,No    they determine whether or not the constitution allows it They are the umpires of legislation They do not interpret the rules    they only make the call of whether the legislation was within in the rules or not within the rule 
PoliticalDiscussion,Of course not there is no such thing as a  national discussion  How on earth can  million people have a discussion about ANYTHING 
PoliticalDiscussion,By INTERPRETING it s meaning
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you read this article   
PoliticalDiscussion,That is not true They are only there to determine whether or not a law is constitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,No  They designed the court to exercise the power in needs to interpret the law 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t understand apparently that our entire foreign policy is a leftist foreign policy grown full seed from Woodrow Wilson  And I can t think of any better way to speed the metamorphasis of Idiocracy in society than to provide a free college education for every US citizen  You don t live in the real world  You have no concept of it  Your ideas are the infantile ideas of someone who has never had any real responsibility let alone work and achieve anything of any value or meaning  I pity you 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe you when you say that you would not like the portion of tax revenue that comes from you to go towards this type of program  There are some items currently supported by tax dollars that I would rather not have my contribution spent upon  Additionally others might have no problem with my idea  As an example I have read that in order to make all higher education completely free in the U S  all it would take would for there to be a reallocation of only  one of these three items a third of the income of the richest  households in the U S  three months of Pentagon spending or less than four months of what we waste on administrative costs by not having a single payer health care finance system  That the government has all the best guns etc is already the case  I am fairly certain that current policy is not terribly leftist in much of its implementation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security is not a  ponzi scheme  Its a safety net for poor people who couldn t save for retirement If Social Security was a Ponzi Scheme the federal government would use Social Security money to fund projects which they don t While Republicans want to cut Social Security it isn t because it doesnt work In fact Social Security has a surplus of over one trillion dollars In short don t buy into the Alex Jones and Ron Paul hype Social Security works and helps millions of elderly Americans 
PoliticalDiscussion,All the power in the hands of a non elected individual 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re exactly right  And right now so much of the Court s power is concentrated in the hands of Justice Kennedy it s not even funny  Definitely not the way it is supposed to work 
PoliticalDiscussion,And your dependents    Not that I really care to continue  Your idea is nothing that I would want to pay for so like all leftist ideology ideas it would have to be implemented through the use of guns and force 
PoliticalDiscussion,You make an excellent point that I hadn t considered The term limits is something which definitely needs to be reconsidered As is you can have five conservative judges and four liberal judges For that to change a judge needs to retire or die You can be sure a conservative judge will not retire while there is democrat in the White House and visa verse So the only thing that will change this balance of power is an untimely death And there is just as much chance that death could be a liberal making an even more unbalanced court   Seeing how politicized the court has become there is no doubt something must be done But getting one side to give up an advantage willingly is not likely  Edit Regardless    there must be a way to remove a judge that consistently rules partisan rather than the under the constrictions of the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt A gun is for self defense but Zimmerman was clearly using it as a substitute for courage and that s utterly inappropriate  Valid point 
PoliticalDiscussion,There would probably need to be a tax deduction or rebate subsidy for those who choose to enroll for private coverage in lieu of using the default fallback coverage IIRC that type of compensation was already a provision of most  public option proposals going around before the ACA wound up getting passed instead 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s clear to me that the Constitution is just too vague to accommodate many nuances of the modern legal quandaries we find ourselves in  The Court has become politicized simply because it is logically and linguistically possible to make the words of the Constitution mean what you want them to mean  I do believe we need that human element  i e  I would not want to replace SCOTUS with a computer program  but I think its effectiveness has been somewhat annulled by the rise of hyper partisanship and the zero sum nature of our two party electoral system  I think it s fine for there to be disagreements between the Justices over what the Constitution says and how to apply it  that s why there are nine of them  I think it is improper for Presidents and Senates to try to  stack the deck  so to speak to try to create a sort of predictability to SCOTUS rulings on certain issues to use ideological litmus tests to decide whether to support or oppose a nomination etc  The original argument against term limits and or elections for Justices was to keep the Court from becoming politicized  Now that it is undeniably politicized anyway I see no issue with imposing a limit on the appointment  ten years or something and only allowing any Justice to serve once  Replace one Justice every year except the tenth year  A two term President could pick up to eight ideologically driven nominees but these would start getting replaced just two years later  
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think it will happen any time soon but we have got to get away from employer provided insurance Tying health care to employment is perverse  Your employer takes the cost of providing your benefits into salary calculations If they just paid you the money instead or put it towards your healthcare taxes it wouldn t change the balance sheet 
PoliticalDiscussion,I sort of like being age indeterminate on reddit so I will bypass that  Without disclosing exact amounts I have earned a living wage for most of my adult life and also paid income taxes  I have only rented which is by no means less costly that purchasing a home in many cases  I do not know how much knowledge I have regarding taxes and politics other than that money goes from one hand to another for various purposes and some is lost via inefficiency and graft  Shall we continue 
PoliticalDiscussion,You stop trying to force people to buy insurance How s that sound 
PoliticalDiscussion,you fail to distinguish the difference between having a stance and acting on that stance    now say obama was asked in a debate how he planned to act regarding this issue and gave a general answer  then after election he reveals that he never intended to follow that plan and will go with a slightly less popular version that is better for him in the present  thats closer to what romney s guys said  except they didnt have the good sense to hold their tongues until after winning 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m going to take a wild guess and say you re a kid under  who hasn t ever had a real income hasn t payed any income taxes never carried a mortgage  and thus paid property taxes and only has a theoretical understanding of how taxes and politics really work 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why do you think the middle class would need to be robbed unless you are saying that taxation at any level is theft  Many of us are not terribly pleased with how some tax dollars are being spent but unless they are not being used for what their intended purpose is stated to be  for example a subsidy to create jobs for a corporation that then lays off workers  most of us do not call it theft 
PoliticalDiscussion,The profit is not the reason profits are a small part of the price and you d have to explain why profits don t have the same effect on other products  The actual reason is because there is no price pressure from consumers  Somewhere around  of health care costs are paid by third parties in the US making the actual patient not care at all about which treatments are given or whether they are cost effective  The reason this occurs is  Medicare which drives up costs and  the tax break for employer sponsored insurance   Another contributing factor is the lack of competition across state lines  Basically the rules are rigged so that patients don t have to care about costs and doctors can maximize profits by offering as many treatments as they can get away with   which is a lot  
PoliticalDiscussion, Child support isn t a government agency or a corporate entity being paid it s the legal system ordering one person to pay another then enforcing that judgement when they don t pay Same as any civil settlement Or you could think of it as a type of contract  A better comparison would be children period You get huge tax breaks for having kids their exemption EIC CTC etc Therefore a person who doesn t have kids is effectively mandated to pay additional tax  Just like someone who doesn t buy health insurance will be 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s a penalty for creating a child and not supporting it thereby breaking the implicit contract that is created when you become a parent 
PoliticalDiscussion,You want a legal reason why he s culpable I ll make it short and sweet When you leave your vehicle to pursue another person you lose your right to claim you were  standing your ground  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt At the end of the day the constitution does not explicitly say you can t do it    The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people  
PoliticalDiscussion, The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people  
PoliticalDiscussion,Signed and agreed The  r politics  r politics back and forth between the two for culpability is inane and ultimately useless The same goes for friends colleagues and co workers that all have the same  information and draw opinions  All we know is the information fed to us by our  routinely biased media sources and information fed to them by their news agencies and the information fed to them from the police press organizations   From that many sources with their own agendas and political leanings how can we  laypeople on the internet with strong feelings no doubt but few  if any actual facts have anything resembling sound opinions on the subject  I ll be reserving judgment until a trial if one ever occurs or an incident report if one is ever published comes to light 
PoliticalDiscussion,These discussions always devolve into  white man is evil etc Frankly the repression of these debates have probably made me more racist than I d be otherwise all I have to go on are statistics and anthropology No one has offered a reasonable explanation for the dysfunction of blacks other than blaming it on whites which is absurd  I mean even if scientists engaged a monumental study that conclusively proved black dysfunction was purely biological what would it matter The government spurred by progressives would immediately use this as an excuse to dump more funding and  tolerance into those communities 
PoliticalDiscussion,but then what s the incentive for employer s to provide health insurance or the employee to take part I still have a portion of my wages go towards health care so wouldn t it be easier for me to deny coverage and go on this Medicaid plan It seems like it would be a punishment for getting a job that is benefited
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the most politically feasible thing in this day in age is to propose levying taxes in order to pay for a government program 
PoliticalDiscussion,Fine At least you provided evidence this time 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem with any kind of discussion on racism is that much of it is unconscious Even still many people somehow think its okay to point out how they are friends with different ethnicities as a proof of they re non racism The dialogue is still very skewed and the focus has not yet shifted from tolerance to acceptance Its one thing to tolerate a person but it takes more strength to be accepting  At the end of the day it didn t actually matter to Mr Zimmerman that Trayvon was black Sure it was a factor but neighborhood watchmen are notorious douchebags You d be assuming quite a lot about Mr Zimmerman if you think he wouldn t hassle any other teenager walking around at night through a gated community with his hood up  The cops on the other hand   
PoliticalDiscussion,R D isn t that much of a cost as you think unless it s a completely new technology  These machines are priced very high because the cost of manufacturing one is very high due in no small part to the limited production these machines see  You almost can think of it as a Ferrari they cost k  k k in the case of a gen CT scanner because maybe  get built a year the company provides on sight servicing of the device and the cost of marketing and sales personnel is also very high  The biggest cost in R D is also generally just device testing to meet FDA standards something which usually is good thing  Hospitals and labs then compensate for this cost plus the cost of having their own technicians to operate the machines by charging what seems like and in some cases is a very high amount for these tests  The price as HonorAmongSteves said is largely based on supply and demand except that it is more of balance between what the insurance companies are willing to pay for and what hospital administrations or laboratories think they can get away with charging  
PoliticalDiscussion,reddit is a leftist online paradise  Not sure what more you require  Prove it to yourself  Do a search for  Kos and  Red State   Hell don t do a search  Just ask yourself blindly which threads with these words have made it to the front page  I can t believe I m even suffering such idiocy  If you think reddit is libertarian you are oblivious beyond hope  certainly more oblivious than I care to deal with

PoliticalDiscussion, gt I m not sold on a voucher system being a good idea for healthcare though Do we want people going in for preventative care or are we only going to cover emergencies   Why couldn t preventive care be covered with vouchers    gt Also a lot of people fail to realize just how much medical costs are  And others fail to realize why it s so expensive Take a look at this article regarding  medical tourism    and check out how much cheaper it can be    gt I don t like the voucher system because in that case the government would most likely be paying for the most expensive patients and their treatments   It has to be paid for anyway Socialism doesn t solve that problem  it makes it worse Where do you think the money will come from if it doesn t come from the government  
PoliticalDiscussion,I was a bit flippant in my original post but the point I was making is borne out by the empirical reality of things  From  this   justice department study  gt About  percent of all black males in the general population were in prison or jail compared to  percent of Hispanic males and  percent of white males  Admittedly the absolute prisoner populations are predominantly white but then whites make up  percent of the population  My point was it is hard to keep incarceration rates low when you have ethnic groups that commit crimes at between three and seven times the rate of the white average 
PoliticalDiscussion,That would be a compromise on a free market solution  Much like what I m saying is needed  I m not sold on a voucher system being a good idea for healthcare though  Do we want people going in for preventative care or are we only going to cover emergencies    Preventative care can often save a lot in the long run but it s one of those things that is easy to look at and say  of those Doctor s visit s were completely unnecessary  Let s cut the budget by    From an economic standpoint that makes sense but then  years down the line you have a lot more late stage cancer patients and the costs are up because no one was detecting them earlier    Also a lot of people fail to realize just how much medical costs are  You say yourself that you haven t been to the Doctor in  years  With many existing conditions you re talking millions of dollars per patient  I know someone with MS who is relatively young  This is not a disease you will die from  Medications average between  k per year without insurance  There are many diseases that are similar  You also have the  million dollar experimental cancer treatments  It would be easy to deny them however those are also the treatments that create medical breakthroughs to bring better and more cost effective treatments in the future  Again in the long term they do help a lot    The people with these diseases are also often the ones who can t work or at best work part time  I don t like the voucher system because in that case the government would most likely be paying for the most expensive patients and their treatments  At that point we may as well include everyone because the costs won t be much more  relatively for the amount of medical coverage  
PoliticalDiscussion,I linked Gladwell for a popular non wonkish treatment of the issue where he did mention the RAND study in explaining that while increased coverage will indeed increase demand for care most of that demand would be for the cheapest types of routine checkups preventive care and early treatment rather than for more expensive remedial procedures  nevermind non covered elective procedures and chronic care which would likely see reduced demand as serious conditions are caught early in those increased routine checkups and  frivolous visits before more expensive procedures become necessary I e  increased coverage actually  discourages the most risky expensive behavior  avoiding care until it becomes more serious and expensive to treat  rather than encouraging exposure to risk as proposed by the  moral hazard argument 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cool thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,We don t know that yet We may never know 
PoliticalDiscussion,This just shows the stupidity of the  stand your ground laws Who s to say Trayvon didn t feel threatened and had to stand his ground He didn t have a gun so he couldn t kill Zimmerman Zimmerman had the gun so he stood his ground and killed him He s dead now so we can t exactly ask him if he was legally standing his ground or not This is what happens when you turn justice into a savage street fight It s a law that condones and by extension encourages people to kill over simple misunderstandings I m surprised it doesn t happen more often 
PoliticalDiscussion,As far as I know there is a broad national mandate but the funding and setup of the systems is all done provincially 
PoliticalDiscussion,Can you  correct me instead of laughing at what you posit to be a humorous statement If I m wrong I d like to be corrected If you don t give me any reason to believe you however I ll dismiss you as making claims without evidence 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right  We re all going to pay for it anyway  So would you rather pay for an office visit where somebody gets treated for high blood pressure or for a heart attack later on  This is one of those magical moments where the humane thing to do also turns out to be the most cost effective 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am against what we currently have  I want single payer or deregulation so that health insurance can be bought and sold across the entire United States instead of state by state limitations that artificially drive up costs and limit choices 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Are you going to feel safe  Hell no   I d be tensed up and ready to defend myself as well  But I wouldn t ambush them either when they started to walk back to their car  It s doubtful or at least highly speculative that Martin saw Zimmerman s gun prior to their scuffle 
PoliticalDiscussion,For Medicare let s be honest  the Dems haven t passed a budget since  and are literally supporting the status quo by passing continuing resolution after continuing resolution  basically just taking the language of the last budget and extending it every time the government starts to run out of money   That ALWAYS includes more money for Medicare to keep the checks flowing to medical providers treating seniors  Unless you can show me a proposal by a Democrat that actually adresses the unsustainability of the program  like the Ryan plan  which keeps it solvent  I refuse to believe that Dems support anything other than the status quo  As for swelling debt  I fully admit Republicans have contributed to our spending probelm in recent years as proportionally as Democrats however Republican spending is usually tax cuts and defense spending which expire or can be cut from the budget  Compare that to expensive  and untouchable entitlements  When was the last time Congress decreased annual spending on Medicare  When was the last time Congress cut benefits for veterans  Medicaid funding for states  It doesn t happen  It can t happen because it s political suicide and seen as harming our most vulernable citizens  My point is that these programs  like Obamacare are much more than a one time cost  When you create government programs that people depend on it s virtually impossible to cut spending for them since increasingly a greater number of people rely on them  Republicans are strongly opposed to creating new entitlements and considering that young people generally have their health and do not use entitlements as much as seniors  unless on Medicaid disability or other programs  creating new entitlements and funding existing entitlements by borrowing more money we have to pay back is harmful to our generation  I m not saying that we should abolish unions  I agree that today s workers  including young workers benefit from the actions of union leaders from previous generations  But in general today s union policies are harmful to young workers in that they aim to protect older  and in some cases and less efficient employees  Young people are attractive to businesses in America  They are cheaper in many cases more innovative and can utilize technology that most older workers will never understand  Unions are only looking out for their own members and since most young workers haven t put in much time in a union they aren t as much of a priority 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t want to turn this into a post bashing conservatives  or liberals for that matter   Once just once I would like to see this happen  Reddit is so naive it is disgusting  I ve worked in politics for  years for Democrats and I absolutely promise you that on economic issues Democrats fail to understand the impact their policies have on the economy  If it weren t for the fact that I am a radical atheist or strong supporter of gay marriage I would have switched over long ago  But even in the democratic party they know their policies aren t better for the economy as a whole  But that s the point Sacrifice the economy for the environment and social gains and that is a matter of priority so you cannot call one or the other out on the importance of their goals  Its so frustrating  Reddit is more liberal than democrats in office  Save for Nancy Pelosi and a few others you guys are way off on the spectrum  I wish the loudest would stop being the most listened to   rant
PoliticalDiscussion,I would love to see the data but that would also make sense considering the cost of care in the U S versus other nations Which brings up another aspect entirely 
PoliticalDiscussion,NO Part of the reason districts look like this is because people like to live next to people like them I ll focus on California the Bay Area is filled with liberals you would have to create a ridiculous district that stretched out in to the central valley to make it competitive and a similar situation would apply to creating a competitive seat in the Republican parts of the state In the book New Political Geography of California it publishes a study that showed even if you disregard legal factors only about  of California s districts could be made competitive  And second the VRA prevents minority voting power from being diluted So it is difficult to split up primarily black districts or primarily latino districts to make the more competitive   Districts are created by the legislature which usually means it will favor the majority party This wasn t the case in California in  because the Dems did not want their obviously biased plan to go the state Supreme Court which was primarily Republican appointed Hence the two parties made a deal and chose bipartisan gerrymandering   To respond to all of this gerrymandering an initiative was passed that would make a citizen commission to deal with the problem But these citizen commissions need to respond to the public s needs and what happened was Democratic inside agents at these public meetings would influence the seats their way And now you have mainly Republicans battling it out with each other in the newly created districts  But honestly unless republicans and democrats live next to each other more often the districts CANNOT be competitive 
PoliticalDiscussion,You understand he s being sarcastic right

PoliticalDiscussion,I believe Medicare still costs much more per person than other universal systems even when accounting for patient age  I know Medicare spending has been growing faster than other nations systems for years 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because Medicare is an unquestionable success right Spending significantly more than you take in every single year with endlessly increasing deficits is a great way to run a health care system  I am not from the US but I find this argument pretty lacking Yes healthcare is one of the few things that do not need to be always profitable in the capitalistic sense  financial bottom line  Many people simply do not have the money to pay for healthcare so subsidising them is the only option short of denying them healthcare If Medicare provided healthcare to those who would otherwise not afforf it then it is a success regardless of the negative bottom line which can be fixed by more wealth redistribution if needed  US has relatively low taxes afterall    gt Obama is racking up debt faster than any other President in history  During economic crisis that is the only way Once it is over then is the time to repay the debt Reps on the other hand racked up debt when there was no crisis so they are worse anyway when it comes to this  Plus when it comes to social issues Dems are a clear win So while they have flaws I think they are by far the better alternative than Reps Blame your political system for lack of more options 
PoliticalDiscussion,Re  Medicare is far from cheap  True but remember Medicare is for the elderly who obviously have higher medical expenses across the board The cost of a single payer system cannot be extrapolated from the cost of Medicare  Re Bureaucracy  Totally Agree with you Private Insurance Bureaucracy meet Government Bureaucracy

PoliticalDiscussion,If you are not working with either of the two political parties that are driving this thing how are your efforts effective 
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare offers a baseline for increased prices from guaranteed customers that don t pay attention to cost because it is covered by a third party  The cost of medical care in the county very much has to do with this 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you ve decided to roll over and play dead anytime your posts are questioned  Given your clearly limited intellect that s probably your best option but I don t see what you get out of posting nonsense every day and refusing to support it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Social stances do not dictate whether economic policy is valid in the slightest  Your point is that social issues are more important to you  And that is valid 
PoliticalDiscussion,  and so is the cranberry 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you familiar with  EMTLA    If not I suggest you get acquainted with it  It was signed into law a while ago by President Reagan    Why are our emergency rooms filled with sick   injured people who can t pay for their care  Well because we do not give them any other option  If a poor man needs preventive care he is not eligible for it until he scrapes up the money  However once his condition gets critical he is eligible for free care in our emergency rooms  This is like not agreeing to pay for someone s automotive oil changes but agreeing to for the rebuilt engine once the old one throws a piston    Market based solutions are very good for the things we want but a poor remedy for many of the things we need  Based on market based solutions I really should have let my wife die a few years ago because the expense of keeping her alive did not nearly come close to the revenue she will bring in for the remainder of her life    The answers to life are not always found on a spread sheet  As far as  shopping is concerned again the market does a poor job satisfying certain needs  If I am diagnosed with some illness that suddenly renders me unable to travel limits my cognitive ability and prohibits me from working to earn income how do I then go shopping for a cure treatment  Time is not on the side of the ill or infirm when it comes to shopping and price comparison for solutions     If I want a car or a new washing machine my life is not hanging in the balance  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Medicare and SS could have been sustainable but Congress and Republicans time and time again took that money and used it elsewhere   No demographics and mathematics are what are causing the problem not the lack of a pile of money   Say you spend  more each month than you bring in  You have a problem    If you have  in savings it doesn t mean you have less of a problem it just puts it off by a few days   This is where Medicare and SS are   they theoretically  could ve had  in savings but they don t and in the long run it wouldn t make any difference anyway    It is funny you blame the R s for it the D s are the ones who want more spending no matter what   A couple of R s are the only ones who even know where the break pedal is   gt The bailouts were bullshit but those were owned by all of Congress not just dems   Yeah both sides are fiscally irresponsible  The only combination that slows the irresponsibility is Republican congress Democratic president and even that only by a little

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Comcast NBC merger   government intervention exists in a big way in cable TV distribution  What is the downside of this  This merger combined two different industries  distribution and production  but it did not increase total market share for the combined entity in either of the two industries You have to look at each industry separately to see competition and the only change when looking at each individually is that the producer has better access to a distribution model and the distributor has better access to the product   gt This isn t what perfect competition is talking to It s talking to the use of non price competition  No what you posted originally is saying that the ONLY competition is price competition  because every product is exactly the same    gt The point of perfect competition is demand will  be based on product quality  I think you need to read what you posted again It clearly states that perfect competition can only happen when every item is exactly the same  therefore no quality competition  and that price is the ONLY competition 
PoliticalDiscussion,A Couple Things    I did not ask the question or make the thread all I did was respond to you     My post had nothing to do with the state of the two party system all I said was that your post added nothing to the discussion at hand and sounded more like your own personal soapbox than anything of actual value to the discussion Which is why I suggested you create a thread so everyone can have a level headed discussion and not the rhetoric you used    Reddit is a website with different communities of people who think differently Some communities want repeated rhetoric because it is comforting and some want actual discussion on the very subjects that you brought up because people know that their perceptions on what is reality is not  accurate  Case and point you thought I was the OP in this thread and made multiple references to that  fact in your post     Try and get back to posts in a more timely manner not everyone will be in the same mindset they were in a month ago or even care about the topic they talked about in the least  Please take this and only this away from this post If you want a discussion about your points please post a thread about it and be open minded If you don t find a sub reddit of more like minded people on that subject  And no I wasn t offended and I am not sure why I would have been

PoliticalDiscussion, gt i think that when people buy healthcare they are buying something that is different from buying other things You re not buying utility you re buying life  As you are with food yet we leave that up to the free market and prices have not skyrocketed well ahead of inflation   gt Is there an example of a non elective procedure that is near universally paid out of pocket i think those procedures might behave differently  Over the Counter drugs Nyquil Anti Histamines Neosporin These are all  procedures that have free market forces acting on them and prices have not spiked where insurance covered drugs HAVE spiked 
PoliticalDiscussion,In truth the Americans outnumbered the Red Coats quite a bit  The British sent troops over and conscripted more from Colonial Loyalists and even freed slaves  The difference was simply strategy training and equipment  The British commanders were well seasoned and their strategy to split the colonies  north south was sound  The Americans tried to fight the war in two different ways simultaneously a professional army which would go head on vs the British and the militia which would sap the British in the rear  I firmly believed foreign intervention shortened the war  with respect to the French at Yorktown  but the Americans would ve won eventually  
PoliticalDiscussion,The issue is what the cause of that disproportionate amount is The most likely theories people have put out involve socio economic conditions and a bias in the judicial system itself rather than something inherent to the races

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Putting everyone in the country on one health care plan gives that plan tremendous bargaining power ove the price of health care  So then why don t we put everyone on the same gas insurance plan The same Food insurance plan how about everyone on the same car insurance plan the same Cell Phone Insurance plan  The free market through millions of consumers has WAY more power to drive down prices than the bureaucratic mess that is Washington 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are way off on Medicare The reason it is supported is because it is the best option that is currently available The problem isn t Medicare The problem is that healthcare costs in the country are rising at an unsustainable path Getting rid of Medicare isn t going to make the problem any better it is just going to shift the cost to those that can least afford it Actually getting rid of Medicare will make the problem worse The cost of Medicare is rising at a slower pace than private healthcare so without Medicare healthcare costs will rise Also Part C is the Medicare part that introduced private insurance and it has been a complete failure running higher costs with worse results You are right that something needs to be done with the healthcare system but Medicare isn t the problem and eliminating it will just make the situation worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like a deer watching a tiger and bear fight over who is going to eat me I think THE most ridiculous thing in the political spectrum is Republicans pretending that they are not just as big of a problem as the Democrats It all comes down to the spending I don t agree with  of Libertarian principles but if we don t start getting a few of these individuals elected to plug the money hemorrhage we are in serious trouble

PoliticalDiscussion, gt When everyone is covered there can be a greater emphasis on preventative measures  How How does forcing everyone to be covered cause greater emphasis on preventative measures It is the routine and  preventative costs which are the ones skyrocketing in price and costing the system the most money because there is no price competition BECAUSE they are covered by insurance   gt Spare me the  skin in the game meme  So you are completely dismissing the entire concept that people can find better prices if they have an incentive to  you know the free market  simply because I used a meme you didn t like How about addressing the concept instead of sidestepping it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s somewhat amusing actually when I saw the title I thought this was going to be about how voting conservative was against young people s economic interests  You don t seem crazy  hope I don t offend you by saying this it s just that so many Republicans are totally bonkers  so I ll be more than happy to offer you my point of view on economics  I think it is in the economic interests of everyone to vote for universal health care public pensions job security and high taxes to pay for it  Universal health care is the cheapest way to get it By making heath care a right  as it is in my country and not a product you remove the profit incentive you remove the bureaucracy you get economies of scale and of course you get fairness Knowing that you will always be treated for free is a huge load off your back The cost of this is that you must pay taxes for your entire life and most of the time you ll hopefully be healthy   This is good for the economy not bad because what you never get is a social underclass of people too sick to work  from treatable illness and too poor to be well These people would pay taxes and be productive if healthy This keeps people in their homes and off the streets and out of the grave keeps families together and children fed and clothed because people aren t faced with unpayable medical bills It is good for businesses to because they don t need to worry about offering insurance IT also avoids the problem the US currently has where people go the the ER at taxpayer expense for minor illnesses or ones which would have been cheaper to prevent or treat early  I could write essays on why deficit spending is good in recession but in short it is because it keeps money circulating and creates jobs For more info the history of FDR s terms in office illustrate well the evidence for this Health care spending and social welfare in economic terms can be viewed also as a form of long term stimulus which actually keeps the economy healthy  As for pensions if everybody pays into the pensions for their lives then they should all get them I accept there are demographic obstacles of an obvious nature but to that I d argue that the boom generation paid higher taxes than we do and thus contributed more than we are  Free education is a good one too In my country all education is heavily subsidised  I paid less than  for  years of university  I was born into a poor family  my grandfather was an illiterate un skilled manual labourer for example and have had long term health problems But I have had roughly  hospital visits and  years of free university education and now I am ready and able to pay taxes for my entire life higher taxes than I would be eligible to pay without a degree because I wouldn t earn as much Without the health care I would be fairly limited in what jobs I could do and I might even have been on disability So those tax payer funded programmes have literally meant the difference between being sick and ignorant to being healthy and educated Is that not of immense value to the economy  not to mention society and most of all individually  it seems to me a society of individuals who are healthy and educated is superior to one where they are not   Finally it seems to me that voting against these programmes is shooting yourself in the foot because without them you are thrown to the vicissitudes of the markets and the economy you depend on being employed for your very life and the lives of your children your pension depends not on the state but on private companies which are prone to collapse  my mother lost  years of pension contributions to a private pension company when it went bust in  a good enough year economically  your education depends on loans which I m told in the US now average more than    Apart from the psychological burden this presents it enslaves you Rather than making repayments  a tax if you will to a for profit bank wouldn t it be better to pay taxes commensurate with your wages so that others may be educated as others in turn paid for you Without cash social welfare payments in times of trouble you will be left to starve Cash payments keeps people above the line where they might seriously consider crime to pay for food and shelter and acts as a life jacket for the economy too by making sure that there is nobody so poor that they never buy anything   I don t know enough about American unions to really comment on them 
PoliticalDiscussion, inch forward  foot back  The political capital for that wasn t there when the Democrats held the Executive and Legislative branches so why would it be easier down the road 
PoliticalDiscussion,Using a place like Reddit to continue the Republican Democrat paradigm is pointless Reinforcing a two party system where both parties are more concerned with corporate welfare and passing constitution eroding law is part of what I believe keeps us in this cycle I was as frustrated with your question as I was with the answers and believe it would be in the vast majorities interest to stop buying into the paradigm   Framing the question as you did IS what I was talking about We pit half of the country against the other half using now meaningless political tags while whoever gets into office continues to centralize power in our federal government benefitting those who can pay  I m sorry if what I posted offended you or wasn t quite put the way you want to hear it

PoliticalDiscussion,very good point i hope there s something that prevents this in the law though 
PoliticalDiscussion,You could easily take that approach toward any flawed social ideology   and they all have flaws Society is not science You can try to approach it scientifically and you can arrive at some empirical knowledge about it but what to do with that knowledge what conclusions to make  what to value  is totally a matter of perspective Brilliant people of all kinds have come to vastly different conclusions about what are the primary concerns of a society Pretending there is only one answer to these kinds of highly subjective social questions the way there is only one answer in math or in the natural sciences and condescendingly dismissing anyone who has come to a different answer than you is incredibly   dumb   Discussion is the whole point  Rhetoric   Persuasion   gt Since we live in different universes what s the point of arguing  So don t argue Leave it alone That s the point Downvoting is engagement Engaging and running away without giving the person an opportunity to defend his remarks is petty and dumb

PoliticalDiscussion,I think there s a point though where it does more harm than good to keep obsessing about it in the media  There was a time when it was necessary since no one really addressed it but we re getting to the point where people are desensitized to it  We have groups like the naacp who cry racism over every perceived slight against black people and it sort of loses its meaning 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Employer provided insurance happens because they get big discounts for buying many many policies in large groups  I think it has more to do with the taxes paid by employers   buying their employees health insurance is cheaper than paying them extra money to buy their own with respect to getting taxed on the payroll  It s an incentive for employers to provide work related health insurance   Dumb system   I don t understand why we can t have a nation wide health insurance market that can t be fucked with by the states and allows larger pools of insured people  It ll probably be cheaper in the long run   more competition  lower rates  We see this with auto insurers quite often 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the whole question misses the point a little  I don t think we should take for granted that people vote out of personal interest I can see that self interest can influence one s politics but I don t think it is  or should be a dominating influence  Less strongly I think the assumption that voters can reliably determine which party best serves their interests is a little shaky

PoliticalDiscussion,Well there s two programs Medicare and Medicaid It looks like you just combined the two with your spelling so I ll just go ahead and explain the difference since I m not sure which one you were referring to  Medicare is a federal program for people over   Medicaid is a broad federal mandate but it s administered by the states It mainly covers those in poverty and children 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  States receive  or used to receive block grants to fund their programs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Me personally No As soon as Zimmerman stepped out of his vehicle and following Trayvon he became the aggressor Even if Trayvon did throw the first punch he is still protected for self defense even with the Stand you re ground law that Zimmerman s is using to defend himself  Zimmerman s use of the  Stand you re ground law is the same as if a armed robber walked into a bank and shot a security police officer so they wouldn t shot back 
PoliticalDiscussion,Anybody that votes Democrat  OR Republican is voting against their own interest  Vote for anybody else that isn t funded by huge corporations lobbyists and banks   
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree 
PoliticalDiscussion,So what are you doing about this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh did you mean it as a compliment 
PoliticalDiscussion,When everyone is covered there can be a greater emphasis on preventative measures    Spare me the  skin in the game meme  
PoliticalDiscussion,Isn t that how Medicaire works in the United States Broad federal mandates but the particulars as far as structure and setup are left up to the states I m not very familiar with Medicaire that s just what I ve gathered 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please don t comment unless you have something to contribute 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Supporting Pro Union Policies I m specifically referring to policies like Last In First Out  in education  which penalize qualified employees simply because they are on the lowest rung of the professional org chart   The main reason unions are bad is because they are labor cartels which use their government protected cartel to raise the price of labor way above market rates   Why is that bad Because of the law of the demand concerning which many liberals are  deniers  The law of the demand guarantees that if you raise the price of labor employers will buy less of it hence labor cartels absolutely create unemployment 
PoliticalDiscussion,If we are going to be that specific the rube goldberg machine side is also missing a few steps including cost control also 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Michelle brings up some good points beyond police protection  that may or may not exist     Are you retarded    Police have no legal obligation to protect you         gt These are things that the majority of society has deemed worth everyone paying into in order to have  No they didn t I never did and you never did So who specifically are you referring to   Furthermore most people don t vote so the majority supports my position not yours   
PoliticalDiscussion,In the case presented that is more blackmail than anything She should suffer legal consequences for it but her choice to have an abortion is hers  I don t think its fair for the man to require her to keep it Pregnancy is  months of wishing you could die for many women there are TONS of post partum issues that have nothing to do with wanting or not wanting the child it alters her body for the rest of her life and its HER body   Although it is almost cruel to inform a man who wants a child that you are aborting his child It is irrelevant to him until you tell him He doesn t need to know I could maybe back a law that says if you choose to involve the father he s fucking involved and he has say But I don t believe that a board of people should be allowed to have say in this Everyone has their own opinions and biases and this would be something based on opinions of the panel If it isn t the father s body it sure as HELL isn t a whole group of people s  I also don t support always requiring child support In cases of marriage dissolution fathers initial involvement and desire for child that caused the woman to go through with the pregnancy or in the case of a man who has excess while the woman and child are barely making it in which case I think that amounts should be need based for only child expenses and dispensed on a card that tracks the purchases which can be reviewed by the father and contested or refunded if used for other purposes Involvement in the child s life should also be a factor If the dad wants any rights to see the child he should be required to help support the child I think its unfair in cases of remarried women who still collect   I have a friend who has a child I think he s  His exwife is remarried and they make bank He barely makes rent on his minimum wage jobs but he still has to pay her Entirely unfair He has no custody of the child and she has a habit of simply taking away all visits  of which he gets one per week for only a set amount of time if he chooses to protest the harassment of her new husband or the child support payment Or just because she hasn t met his roommates yet When she refuses to meet them The guy is a great father loves his kid Doesn t deserve what he gets   I apologize if my writing seems random or nonsensical I fail at writing and I m lacking in sleep severely Hopefully this post makes enough sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,Increasing Debt Deficit Spending Republicans really have a great misleading PR for this one I love how well they pull it off  in a  wow awesome job but it s really sad everyone bought it sort of way   I take it you ve never done any in depth analysis of which party actually does this historically It s been extremely one sided until this administration which bucked the trend of dems lowering the national debt 
PoliticalDiscussion,With all due respect I think you re using some straw man arguments that want to be addressed   I m not sure anybody supports the status quo for Medicare  The demographic issue is real but the best solution is controlling rampaging health care costs which are the product of a badly broken system  Universal coverage will reduce these costs which is one of the reasons the Affordable Care Act is a step in the right direction  The worst solution would be to eliminate or dramatically curtail benefits   I ll be a senior citizen someday too and I don t want to have to pay for health care under the Ryan plan    Nobody supports our swelling debt either  I m not sure why anybody thinks that dramatically cutting taxes is going to help  The Laffer Curve is an economic fig leaf that fails to conceal the common sense of the situation  The Reagan and Bush tax cuts were both accompanied by decreases in federal revenue and dramatic increases in the national debt  Letting the Bush tax cuts expire on time would have instantly subtracted  to  percent of the deficit  The President has suggested sensible entitlement reform but that can t be the only solution   we already have the most serious income inequality in nearly a hundred years    And finally Unions are one of the only tools we have to curb the power of Corporations  Most of the labor laws that protect workers of all ages are the direct result of Union activism  I agree with some of the specific points you make about them but to forsake them alltogether  which many Republicans are clearly trying to do is to cede our future to Corporate power 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you should give reference to some of the items and agendas you cite just to give those with less of an in depth knowledge of history in politics  Particularly if you re referring to younger voters who will of course have a much smaller background knowledge 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d love for you to actually explain your position 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bullshit Gore won under virtually all legitimate scenarios The Florida election was no different than a North Korean election where the brother of Kim Jong Bush used criminal steps to destroy forever the concept of free fair elections 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly 
PoliticalDiscussion,It has become a wholly owned subsideriy of right wing big business interests After the  election the Supreme Court lost complete credibility It is at least the  righties a subset of Koch Industries for sale and ruling with no concept of the constitution
PoliticalDiscussion,Well for one you use a term so vague that it s impossible to define  Conservative Economics  What does that mean   That markets are more efficient than bureaucracy That is almost always the case   That regulation increases the start up cost of business so regulation should be kept to a bare minimum Of course regulation makes business more expensive Almost by definition   That  if everything else is equal  a country with lower taxes will encourage more businesses to it s shores than a country with higher taxes This is an economic fact   You see there aren t a whole lot of  if any economists who disagree with these points Of course we can argue what the bare minimum of regulations are and what regulations are more beneficial because of the good to the overall population even with the increased costs and how high our taxes should be if we want to remain competitive internationally That doesn t mean people who tend to be more conservative on those issues are living in a bubble   The problem with painting with such a broad brush as    gt People who believe in conservative economics are living in a bubble almost as far removed from reality as the Christian Right  is that not only is it unnecessarily combative  and makes dialogue and compromise that much harder  but it try s to take away the middle ground between the fringes of radical economic thought   It s not helpful in anyway  and it s not particularly accurate either 
PoliticalDiscussion,I d love to know why you think so 
PoliticalDiscussion,   That s ludicrous 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt His proposal uses mystical phrases like  expanding the economy which somehow leads to higher government income  Higher income  through GDP growth  taxed at the same rate would generate higher tax receipts Relying on economic growth in a budget plan to the degree that Romney does though is ridiculous 
PoliticalDiscussion,No it is not possible Most people are irrational Thats not just the law of averages either Obviously some people will always be smarter than most and most will always be smarter than some It does not have to be the case that most are irrational as they are in the US and many other countries There are countries which have developed high cultural standards where most people are rational thinking people They also tend to be less inviting of immigration and for damn good reason  Diversity is not always pretty Sometimes you need standards and if that means most people in some other group dont qualify tough luck for them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Concerning Point  Medicare and SS could have been sustainable but Congress and Republicans time and time again took that money and used it elsewhere sapping it dry And the Republican solution of  privatization is bullshit   Concerning Point  The bailouts were bullshit but those were owned by all of Congress not just dems IMHO Republicans had more to gain from the bailouts And with the debt you can t look at it as a number alone   our national debt must be looked at  relative to our GDP If increased spending  e g stimulus increases our GDP to a relative point higher than previous then the stimulus actually decreases our debt even though the  raw national debt number goes up  Point  Yes a lot of union policies drove a lot of jobs overseas and I m not a huge fan of them However there are a lot scarier things being pushed by Republicans I d rather have unions than have gay marriage become illegal and abortion criminalized  Social issues are a reflection of economic issues If a Republican is one sided bigoted and biased from a social standpoint why should I expect his economic stances to be any different If you can t be fair and civil with others on a social level then your business sense doesn t stand to be any better 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If you earn a college degree you earn it through your own hard work and not because someone else helped you get the job done  This is true on narrow level of the individual work required but quite false on a practical level for many not to mention the fact that for almost everyone the path  to college could not be built without the assistance of many other people i e teachers parents mentors etc What I mean by practical though is monetary in many cases such as mine this is directly related to unions Simply put I would not be able to attend my university if not for the scholarship I won from my father s union Every year that local and thousands across the country give out financial assistance so that the sons and daughters of members might have a chance to do better than their parents This is however a semantic point    gt My main concern about unions is that they collect union dues and then use that money to contribute to Democratic campaigns in exchange for policies that are perceived to only benefit their own union  Well then you don t have to worry about anyone who doesn t want their dues being used for political purposes they don t support Even in states without  right to work laws a union may not use dues collected by from a member to support a political cause the member objects to In such a case the member is entitled to a refund of the portion of his dues which would have gone to political activity The only dues which are legally obligated are the ones which are used to support collective bargaining and contractual enforcement i e the process which provides the member with a contract and legal access through the duty of fair representation I wish I could give you a specific Board or court case but I m going from memory of my last labor law class    gt My problem is with union bosses and I don t believe most union bosses act in the best interest of their workers  This belief would be inconsistent with most ideas relating to a conservative school of economics in re an assumption of rational economic actors If you believe that people act in their own self interest and evaluate risk vs reward in the long run then it would follow that someone who derives their livelihood from an elected position would act in the best interests of his electorate in order to ensure re election   Now since I don t believe in a perfectly rational actor  and perhaps you don t either I don t know right now  I ll be the first to tell you that there are bad labor leaders who don t always act in the interests of the union The same can be said however for leaders of any institution from governments to corporations to hedge funds  e g Richard Nixon Kenneth Lay Bernie Madoff  there is nothing which would indicate that unions are any more prone to this type of behavior than any other institution In fact after a few high profile cases in the  s and  s many major unions underwent a major bit of institutional reform which increased the accountability of leadership to the members  e g the UMWA USW and Teamsters   
PoliticalDiscussion,You know that it is possible to look at a set of incomplete facts which is basically what any type of economic analysis does and come to a different conclusion than someone else right It s the height of arrogance to assume that someone could only hold a particular opinion because they are misinformed or have not examined evidence It tends to be a major flaw of many liberals as well   Also if you think that the Republican party of the  s and  s was anything like the Republican Party of the  s  the stand pat McKinley era   s  the era of normalcy  or  s  the age of Goldwater  or today your analysis is quite flawed There are many different analyses of Abraham Lincoln but many of the things that his immediate successors assumed he stood for are anathema to the present Republican Party Read Theodore Roosevelt s speech that he gave in  in Osawatomie Kansas  It s called the New Nationalism   Now of course TR s political evolution is complex and this speech is just one facet of a very complex man but it gives a good idea of how the GOP changed not just from the  s to  but especially to the present day   I also really don t know what you mean by  ending the Civil Rights Movement I m just going to point out that the Civil Rights Movement represents a time of major change for the GOP There were indeed many Republicans who were staunch supporters of the Civil Rights Act of  and the Voting Rights Act of   but they belonged to the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party That wing no longer exists because it was toppled by the supporters of Barry Goldwater and then purged by the supporters of Ronald Reagan  basically the same people  That s because Rockefeller was fond of saying things like this    gt  The only justification for ownership is that it serves the broad interests of the people We must recognize the social responsibilities of corporations and the corporation must use its ownership of assets to reflect the best interests of the people   In  the Republican Party ran Barry Goldwater who was opposed to the most important parts of the Civil Rights Act namely Titles II and VII The Republicans were moving quickly away from any connection they had with civil rights indeed the most well known Republican Supreme Court justice of this new era William Rehnquist is infamous for having written a memo to Justice Robert Jackson when he was a clerk arguing that  Plessy v Fergusson should be upheld   In the end most of the important advances in civil rights were made either through the direct action of individuals  e g the Memphis Sanitation Strike or through Democratic legislation with Rockefeller Republicans making up for the Southern Democrats Indeed this trend goes back to the  s and is why blacks left the Republican Party Throughout the  s the GOP ignored blacks while trying to cultivate a Southern Republican Party When the Depression came blacks were hit hardest because they were already on the economic margins and the New Deal flawed as it was brought them into public life for the first time since Reconstruction  Read a long essay I wrote about the subject here   
PoliticalDiscussion,When you read their economic proposals Romney   increases  the national budget by something like Trillion dollars over the next  years with no tangible accountability for increasing net revenue His proposal uses mystical phrases like  expanding the economy which somehow leads to higher government income Slashing taxes on rich people and slashing government programs that are used to help those that have a hard time due to inflated profitable businesses not creating new jobs isn t  in my opinion a viable or appropriate economic plan 
PoliticalDiscussion,If anything liberal voters are voting against their own best interest because there simply are far too few candidates who represent them or the long term goals of this country  They vote democratic because their only other option is batshit crazy social policies and corporate cronyism  Give us a better election system and you ll find the candidates that see broader implications for their policies instead of the tired political garbage that is discussed endlessly to distract us 
PoliticalDiscussion,What you said is completely true As a young conservative I also feel like majority of our generation don t really know what s going on economically and their political concern for social matters overweigh their knowledge of economic matter   This is just an assumption but majority of our generation are kind of clueless and are looking for the right answers to their questions When they hear someone like Obama speak about social laws and rules they agree because it sounds like what they want When Obama speaks about economic laws and rules they agree to that too not because its what they want but because they don t know any better and are trusting a guy who seems to undertand what they want  If that majority understood how economics truly works and look at the history of what it means to be Republican  freeing slaves ending the civil rights movement etc  then I m almost certain that majority would reconsider who they support
PoliticalDiscussion,We have a markedly different worldview I disagree with most of what you said but it s largely opinion so we can agree to disagree on most points  I don t believe employers take care of their employees They exist to make money Keeping employees happy is a good business decision   but only a means to an end  Most workers aren t unionized I think that s unfortunate too  I call employer funded health care perverse because if you lose your job you lose your health care If you get so sick you can t work you ll often end up bankrupt Not to mention you get employers making health care decisions for their employees What sort of sense does that make Most employees get a few plans and can pick between them   I would prefer to be able to pick my own  Any sort of statewide plan will spread the risk out over a huge population With employer funded plans people who work for big companies pay less than people who work for small companies another anti competitive factor  Your healthcare is already a numbers game Death panels  not that you mentioned the word are bureaucrats who are only beholden to their shareholders They deny coverage whenever they can because that s how they re incentivized I would prefer the bureaucrats be beholden to the taxpayer 
PoliticalDiscussion,not good enough  We need a total revamp of the voting system  Dont have time to post it now  later
PoliticalDiscussion,People who believe in conservative economics are living in a bubble almost as far removed from reality as the Christian Right 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Employer provided insurance happens because they get big discounts for buying many many policies in large groups   gt I don t think its perverse either Isn t that the whole idea that employers should be taking care of their employees Isn t that what unions fight for  An entire state  or a nation is a much bigger group than one employer so there would be even bigger discounts no  The problem with tying health insurance to employment is that if you have a treatable  but expensive medical condition and you lose your job for whatever reason you are instantly  utterly fucked  Once your health starts going south  since you can t afford treatment  you ll have a hard time finding a new job so you can t get new insurance so you can t get treatment A fallback health care plan  or even a universal health care plan solves this issue   gt To me a government provided healthcare isn t as desirable Anything the government gives you they can take away Everyone has experienced frustration with government whether it be at the state level  like the DMV who always tell you about some form you re missing or at the federal level Imagine all the forms you d have to fill out the questions you d have to answer  This is a strawman argument There are plenty of countries out there that do in fact do a national  or provincial or whatever health care system and often do quite a good job of it If you re going to argue that government health care inevitably leads to interminable paperwork and a  numbers game  which private insurance already is by the way  private insurers don t have infinite money either  then at least bring up concrete examples from countries that have actually done it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Hi there I m only  and this will be my first year voting I don t consider myself particularly knowledgeable about politics nor do I really know for sure which side I fall on Though I do read watch the news I don t actively seek out tons of information and probably in reality know next to nothing In other words I m your average college aged kid so I m going to try and give a view from that perspective    I don t care so much about the economic policy of the republican party because it s not what s being talked about in this election For every time I hear a politician state his opinion on the economy there are ten times I hear about his views on abortion or gay marriage or some other social issue In fact now that I m thinking about it the only economic policy I can think about is Herman Cain s   plan and I don t even actually know anything about that besides the name I get some of my news from google news articles I read while I m pretending to pay attention in art history but a lot of it comes from Reddit or the daily show or links my friends post on facebook People talk about what s interesting and divisive and in this election it just so happens to be the social issues I know that this is definitely not the best way to get my news and I know that I could probably seek out the economic policies of each candidate but I just dont I m a double major in college and work a part time job and in between classes and work and homework and clubs and friends I don t have a lot of time left in the day  this is how it is for every college student The last thing I want to do with my time is go slog my way through a bunch of political discourse  I just want to relax and play my guitar  or video games or something Especially since politics today seems so distasteful  why would I want to spend my spare time looking up more things that are just going to depress me or make me angry about something that I feel like I realistically have no power to change    Downvote me to oblivion for being ignorant if you d like but I m just being honest I m not saying it s right the rational part of me knows that I should care about this stuff since it s my future that s hanging in the balance but it s just not something I follow through on in everyday life I d imagine it s the same for a large portion of people my age I d say either the political discourse needs to change so it s easier for people to get the information they d need to be informed on all sides or we need to change the attitudes of people like me so they re willing to seek it out themselves Neither one of those is an easy feat though  tl dr most young voters don t know enough about the economic policies of republicans to see that they might actually be beneficial to them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Many researchers are skeptical that this is an effective way to fund medical innovation  We pay twice as much for brand name drugs as most other industrialized countries  Anderson says  But the drug companies spend only  percent of their revenues on innovation So yes some of that money goes to innovation but only  percent of it    That is actually a lot What other industries spend more 
PoliticalDiscussion,I do not think force is necessary  It is possible that people could become more interested in the betterment of the species than in having children from their loins Breeders could produce enough children for all who desire children to adopt   Just saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe it is just coercion that hospitals can t receive federal money if they don t treat people Not sure what the constitutionality is involving that 
PoliticalDiscussion,We can hope 
PoliticalDiscussion,That justification expired a couple years ago and deficits are still near  trillion per per year  Your plan to pay it off doesn t even come close  Run the numbers  I have a problem with people who have repeated the party line so many times they think it is the truth  Edit why didn t you answer my question 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act was signed into law back in the  s under President Reagan  Maybe this will be the next to fall by the wayside as we ride the Republican Freedom Train  
PoliticalDiscussion,This isn t true The middle class was built on the manufacturing sector in the US In fact it was the movement of blue collar work to the middle class that created teh boom times of the  s The idea that the middle class does not include the manufacturing sector is simply a convenient modern fiction one born out of the death of the middle class in the united states 
PoliticalDiscussion,Justification Prevented the US from entering a great depression  Plan to Pay it Off Let Bush tax cuts expire for those making more than k withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan enact Healthcare reform to reverse the medical cost curve let economic growth do the rest  What do you have a problem with again 
PoliticalDiscussion,But there are non signatories with nukes too so they can just buy from them And the USA has basically handed out nukes to  or so European nations via NATO without technically violating the treaty because they are controlled by US troops until war is declared 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well thats  provinces  nunavut doesnt really count it has like fifty thousand people in it conpare to fifty states with a lot more people and much larger political rifts 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody said anything about your company  Just because this might not be happening at your company doesn t mean that it doesn t happen elsewhere though  For all we know your company could be firing people because it s run by a bunch of idiots who are running the business into the ground  I m not saying that s the case but it could be and we d have no way of knowing 
PoliticalDiscussion,ACA has its merits look at the canadian ealth care system But the ACA is a case in point example of how when one party tries to force through legislature the other party will immediately try to repeal it when elected Bipartisan systems suck Gary johnson  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes let s just feed the elderly to the wolves That ll work out great 
PoliticalDiscussion,although i would want to deny the buying food as buying life comparison  i think you have a point but i still think the relationship is dubious regarding the way people  think about it  i will grant you the point for the sake of argument but even so we can look at food and the OTCs in the same way in that if people want the can exchange quality goods for cheaper lower quality goods  Off the top of my head i don t think this occurs in the fields that are non market there aren t really replacement goods for an MRI or for an open heart surgery    Now i don t think this is a criticism per se of your argument maybe it could be applied similarly to the charter school movement where individual doctors act as independent contractors and charge based on their skill etc   certainly for this scenario i think we would additionally need an reform of some malpractice law for the market to work and i don t know about how popular having doctors with low relative survival rates being allowed to practice would be but is this where you would go with such a replaceable goods scenario  or is that even an issue for you  replaceability that is   
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree  The news media can turn any topic they want any way they want  Want to sway an election  Take politician A ignore his good ideas and air and investigate his bad ideas  Then take his opponent and ignore his bad ideas and air and investigate his good ideas  It will work on the majority of Americans but not everyone every time  It s not only politics  The same thing happens with any hotly debated topic  For instance it happens with racial issues all of the time  If you pay attention you can tell which way the news is trying to sway your opinion  Unfortunately not many people pay attention 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well among other things treaty signatories are prohibited from selling or transferring nukes or nuclear technology to non nuclear states being unable to simply buy them from a nuclear state theoretically raises the costs of developing nukes  In other words without the treaty there would probably be a lot more countries with nuclear weapons 
PoliticalDiscussion,You shouldn t have been downvoted that was a fair question   Personally I have found that the more educated I become on the politicians and the issues the less inclined I am to vote for any of them I have actually become a conscientious non voter for the most part I find it strange that it turned out that way but I gotta go with my conscience 
PoliticalDiscussion,Naryn Bush was the first party to ask the courts to intervene  Nov            Bush petitions U S District Court to stop Florida recount Court denies request  had the Supreme Court let the Florida Supreme Court continue the investigations and vote counting Bush would be a foot note in history  You missed the salient point that the Supreme Court along partisan political lines stopped all recounts in favor of Bush This decision was so partisan and legally decrepit that they said it set no precedent and could not be used in any future legal cases It was a coup d  tat by the felonious five and nothing less 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Union busting actually has the effect of killing the middle class  Union jobs are generally blue collar jobs which are not generally middle class in terms of pay etc White collar non union jobs is typically where the middle class begins 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The reason it is supported is because it is the best option that is currently available   Not for young people it isn t Technically the best option for young people is no health coverage and no insurance premiums to pay or medicare taxes to pay  Medicare is a redistribution of money from the young to the old It works against the youth s interests 
PoliticalDiscussion,On top of that there s a huge difference between the state and federal governments 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why don t those same discounts and tax incentives exist for individual insurance plans   Even if you look at people without insurance they pay more for the same health services Employers and government programs are able to negotiate for better prices by using their policy holders as leverage In fact government programs actually pay less then private insurers for the same services   it s also why some doctors are hesitant to take them Individual buyers receive no incentives and are largely unable to negotiate properly   gt Imagine all the forms you d have to fill out the questions you d have to answer It would turn your healthcare into a numbers game   Healthcare is already a numbers game at every level and there is already an astonishing amount of bureaucracy It s just a hybrid of public and private programs that leaves individual policy holders with the worst plans and highest administrative overhead It leaves the uninsured with hefty bills that often leads to bankruptcy which is then redistributed to higher costs for everyone else   gt  Medicare s administrative costs are in the range of  percent That s well below the  to  percent costs borne by large companies that self insure It s even further below the administrative costs of companies in the small group market  amounting to  to  percent of premiums  And it s way way lower than the administrative costs of individual insurance  percent  It s even far below the  percent costs of private plans under Medicare Advantage the current private insurance option under Medicare     Having employer provided health insurance reduced labor flexibility and makes starting a small business more difficult It also raises everyone s health insurance premiums and leads to some people not receiving healthcare How is that helpful for our economy   We need affordable health insurance options that have cost sharing  to reduce cost and government subsidies  to increase affordability on a sliding scale  Employers shouldn t be seen as the gate keepers of affordable health plans There s no real reason for it aside from the hodgepodge of historical shifts and legislative changes that lead us here 
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare is running deficits that are growing larger and larger every year  It s just not sustainable unless taxes are raised to obscene levels and maybe not even then  It has nothing to do with whether medical care is for profit or not  Also there is no natural right to have wealth redistributed to pay for as much care as everyone wants  The economic crisis is over Deficits are still huge and there is no plan to end that in sight  Dems are not a clear win on social issues either 
PoliticalDiscussion,OH 
PoliticalDiscussion,Message control  Trying to rewrite history 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  President for life Chelsea Clinton s first four hour prime time speech on every channel and through every ISP 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well that was refreshingly honest   gt I don t care so much about the economic policy of the republican party because it s not what s being talked about in this election  Not that it is a surprise but it is scary to see how easily people s cares are controlled by what topics are brought up by our new sources 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s end that too Are you with me or for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Its a demonstrable statement 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah We should be nothing like all those countries that are more financially stable than we are and cut shit and deregulate Oh wait No 
PoliticalDiscussion,Only votes are counted and a non vote is not a vote  I ve occasionally left blank fields on ballots when I didn t like any of the candidates  gubernatorial elections or didn t know enough about them  local crap I don t pay attention to   I guess I could write in my cat s name but what s the point of doing that   
PoliticalDiscussion,Iceland and every time in history we ve deregulated an industry just go to show that you re blatantly wrong And every single other modern nation in the world using liberal economics Oh and Keynesian economics have never been discredited But if you d like to be more misinformed go for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nancy Pelosi is a centrist at best Sorry you don t understand economics but the fact of the matter is that every  socialist nation we liberals want to emulate is very financially stable and every time a nation tries to implement a less regulated conservative policy it backfires 
PoliticalDiscussion,I understand that and if I had the opportunity to speak with each of them personally on the matter I would ask them the same question 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  gt   gt  gt It is typically only consumed under duress incapacitation or the like  gt  gt No it is not The majority of healthcare is NOT consumed under duress Yes the larger price tag things ARE but the smaller price tag things  i e checkups prescriptions  which make up the bulk of actual spending are not and could easily be shopped around for That shopping around by people who are not under duress will drive prices down for those that are under duress  No  The largest line item is Hospital Care          gt  gt There are no alternatives or substitutes  gt  gt Just like there are no alternatives or substitutes for gasoline in my car Yeah price competition still works there  Just because there is not a substitute for gasoline doesn t mean there isn t a substitute for your car  If gas prices rise too high people will begin to walk ride bikes take public transport and the like    Further no one dies if substitute one of the above for your car   gt  gt One cannot choose to forgo chemotherapy in favor of some similar but less expensive option in the way a person can forgo owning a large home in favor of a small apartment  gt  gt No but if there are  hospitals in the area that provide Chemo and I have incentive to find the cheapest one then all the standard market forces apply the exact same as when I need to fill up my gas tank  Unless you can t afford the least expensive Chemotherapy  What then  You die   gt  gt Certain  consumers are completely price insensitive Patients with severe chronic or terminal illnesses have no incentive to seek out a lower cost alternative because even the lowest cost alternative will bankrupt them anyway  gt  gt As I stated above it only takes a portion of the consumer base to drive competition That competition will benefit everyone even those like the ones you describe  No it won t  If there is an incredibly small demand for a drug or procedure it wil remain excessively expensive and will not be  diluted by the other spending because you will be paying for line items rather than paying into a pool of money   gt  gt A Consumer needs highly specialized knowledge to know what is necessary and what is not A Layperson is not qualified to determine if a test is needed or not Or to decide whether or not they should get surgery Or if they can live with a broken bone  gt  gt Just like they need highly specialized knowledge to know if they need their muffler repaired or not They need to consult with a doctor then if they don t believe they actually need it they can go and do more research get a second opinion talk to people they know that are familiar with it and make an informed decision  Because you don t die if you have a broken muffler  Because you don t die if you go to a cut rate muffler service and they botch the job     gt  gt  Remember healthcare is different because i almost everybody wants to have as little of it as possible ii the more in need of it the consumers are the less capable they are of making their own decisions Does that sound like any other consumer good  gt  gt Yes it sounds like Food Gasoline Tow service Auto repair etc    Food you can choose to cook at home or change your diet to cut costs Gasoline Tow Service and Auto Repair you can eschew a car  Or live in the city  Or take the Public Option err i mean public transportation    gt  gt We need to focus on the promotion of proactive health not encourage the over consumption of reactive healthcare  gt  gt And what better way to focus on the promotion of proactive health than to decrease the cost of it drastically  gt  Then why aren t insurance companies focusing on preventive care  They aren t concerned with lowering costs They are concerned with selling  high profit items  It doesn t change in the market  In a market sceneario everyone is trying to charge the most and give the least away    everything changes when your life is on the line  Everything changes when a poor decision now can affect the rest of your or other s lives 
PoliticalDiscussion,Marlo Thomas was That Girl  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Except that competition is not in interactions between the consumer and the producer   Not quite  Is it your assertion that our town s fire department would be better equipped to meet the needs of the local community if we all hired private companies     gt Why don t we have single payer for any other industry   Because health care fire protection police and so many things are  different from rug markets ice cream stands and tattoo parlors  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Federal government does use tax refund offsets to pay child support debts though so there is a bit of an overlap 
PoliticalDiscussion,I will never vote for a Republican at least not in their current form  Why  Social conservatism is evil Social conservatives are evil people No one associated with them should be allowed to have any power over the laws of this country and every Republican is associated with them including so called  libertarians who hold their nose and vote  R in every election  You re talking about economic issues I agree that those are important but they are of secondary importance to me  and I disagree with your positions on those issues anyway  
PoliticalDiscussion,So if everyone drops their insurance plan they are automatically enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid That would basically create de facto Universal healthcare especially for people with less favorable contracts The Congress wouldn t pass a law like that unless they were already willing to raise taxes and create a fully subsidized public healthcare system   If the mandate is overturned I think the government would just have to raise taxes and create a fund to pay for the uncompensated care in a more substantial manner to reduce the burden on insured patients   Then there would be another push for Universal Healthcare and Republicans would push back with health savings accounts and tax incentives to get people to buy individual health insurance on their own  
PoliticalDiscussion,Like Dick Cheney s Heart transplant   O wait that was paid for using government tax dollars   nm   
PoliticalDiscussion,Who generated more by GDP  FDR during WW  Washington when the federal government assumed the debt of the states after the revolution  It matters whether you have a justification for it and a viable plan to pay it off  He doesn t have either at this point which is what I have a real problem with 
PoliticalDiscussion,Technically I haven t voted in anything yet as I haven t been old enough to register for that long But do you really think that the majority of people in America research their choice thoroughly before they vote Because I can tell you now that that s not the case 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt OR fucking people are bad at thinking long term are greedy and when faced with a benefit with  steps away rather than a benefit  steps away they ll take the  step benefit  even if the  step has greater benefit  These are stockholders They are in it for the long run They are the ones making the decisions not the CEO that is in it for a few and out   gt The only thing stockholders demand is a return If they want a better return they chase another stock rather than take the effort to convert all stockholders of the benefit of thinking long term  Or they buy stocks for companies that are thinking longterm and those that are not thinking longterm lose potential buyers so their stock price goes down 
PoliticalDiscussion,They haven t kicked in yet have they  Also who knows what the comparative pricing of an exchange group plan will be compared to an employer group plan blah blah blah people will still fall through the cracks    It does close the gap some so that s good  I think the ACA did some very important things  I just don t think  is enough incentive for people to buy a   insurance plan  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Competition exists in the Single Payer Universal Health Care model  Except that competition is not in interactions between the consumer and the producer It is in interactions between the producer and a bureaucratic monstrosity  Why don t we have single payer for any other industry Gas Food If it is so great why not have the Government take over EVERY industry set prices and we would all be better off 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obama is racking up debt faster than any other President in history  Debt only matters on a percentage to GDP basis or compared to previous levels  Your statement is only true if you re looking at absolute numbers 
PoliticalDiscussion,No genius you would have done all of that in advance when you shopped for major medical coverage if you were a responsible individual  Insurance is for instances like an auto accident not predictable events like physicals  What you want is your healthcare paid for by others 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt in  Republican economics  FTFY
PoliticalDiscussion,I think republican policies are a disaster  especially in a recession  Economically they are often correlated with recession and depression   Union busting actually has the effect of killing the middle class which leads to wealth concentration which leads to lack of mobility in the economy which leads to economic stagnation   The kind of spending cuts republicans talk about are a disaster in an ecnonomic downturn and have always failed Hell they made the great depression last an extra decade or so  Medicare is a disaster not because it is publicly funded health care but because publicly funded health care isn t the norm In countries where it is the norm healthcare is a lot cheaper than it is in the US Private for profit health care drives the price of all health care up and while medicare is better at dealing with the price increases  due to being a very large bargaining block it still suffers  Basically you have everything pretty much backwards economically 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let s not forget this   gt  In a rebuff to President Obama the Republican controlled House passed a bill on Thursday to abolish a Medicare cost control board created by the new health care law   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the board could increase Medicare spending by a total of  billion from  through      Both sides seem unwilling to address the Medicare issue Everytime a proposal comes forward to reduce costs it s blocked in some fashion                                                                 Younger workers in Unions are still more likely to have better pay and benefits then their non union counterparts   gt Over the period   in the workforce as a whole about  percent of all workers were unionized Over the same period as Table  shows only about  percent of young workers were in a union or represented by a union at their workplace  see row   Unionized younger workers typically earned substantially more than their non union counterparts In   the median unionized  to  year old earned about   per hour compared to   per hour for the median non union worker of the same age Unionized younger workers were also much more likely to have health insurance   percent than younger workers who weren t in unions   percent  and also much more likely than younger non union workers to have a pension plan   percent compared to  percent   source      gt For younger workers wages and benefit coverage vary substantially by gender and union status In   young men were somewhat more likely to be unionized   percent than young women were   percent  On average young men in a union earned substantially more    per hour than their non union counterparts    per hour  and were much more likely to have health insurance   percent and a pension   percent than if they were not in a union   percent for health insurance  percent for pension coverage   Young women in unions also earned more     than those who were not in unions      and were also much more likely to have health insurance   percent and a pension   percent than young women who were not in a union   percent for health insurance and  percent for pension coverage   source    There are still benefits to being in a Union as illustrated by these statistics Younger workers value higher pay and health insurance so they are willing to join Unions It s a personal decision that they make If they were bothered by the protections they would get a different job  There are instances of a two tiered work force in some Unions like at Chrysler but overall young workers are okay with that fact because it means they will have a good job with benefits A lot of these people are just glad to have jobs It s also still better then the benefits they would get at a non union job 
PoliticalDiscussion,And you did not read what I wrote  Competition exists in the Single Payer Universal Health Care model 
PoliticalDiscussion,OR fucking people are bad at thinking long term are greedy and when faced with a benefit with  steps away rather than a benefit  steps away they ll take the  step benefit  even if the  step has greater benefit  Look at smokers  The only thing stockholders demand is a return  If they want a better return they chase another stock rather than take the effort to convert all stockholders of the benefit of thinking long term 
PoliticalDiscussion,A quick search didn t turn up the article I seem to remember reading so maybe I am wrong but it also seems to make sense to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll give you that  But it won t be  one type of Homo Sapien it will be a new species altogether 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So when I am involved in an auto accident and desperately need an ambulance to take me to the hospital to save my life I need to send out for bids evaluate my options and make the best choice Got it  Again you did not read what I wrote   gt thereby making healthcare cost drastically less for everyone both those that have time to shop around and those that do not 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt thats closer to what romney s guys said   Yeah   We should hold Romney accountable for a staff member s wording on how a politician changes his campaign when he goes from the primary to the general election   But we  shouldn t hold Obama accountable for the words that come out of his mouth as he begs the leader of Russia to understand that he will act one way with Russia before the election and a different way after the election  You are very wise 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Wouldn t it be better to take the cost savings of the merger and a lot of it to the workers than the executives and stock holders This would allow the workers  way more people to engage in business transactions with Comcast i e purchase higher premium packages etc which increase the value of the stock in the long run  a sort of trickle up affect    If that were true then it would be happening as the stockholders would demand it It is not true which is why it is not happening

PoliticalDiscussion,So when I am involved in an auto accident and desperately need an ambulance to take me to the hospital to save my life I need to send out for bids evaluate my options and make the best choice  Got it  For the record competition exists in single payer universal health care  
PoliticalDiscussion,No it isn t That s simply a misunderstanding The cost of procedures is lower in Canada   the cost to me is nothing The subsidies are  of the cost and they are much much lower than the cost of the same procedure in the US 
PoliticalDiscussion,You live in VA too 
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems more that voting for those things would be for  immediate self interest without looking at what effect it will have in the future 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh so  unions are the reason why my company is firing Americans and hiring overseas We don t have a union where I work how is it that unions are causing this unemployment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Doubt it It s easier to get conservatives on board with social freedom than progressives with economic freedom 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The main argument is that health care is a unique good and has special properties that make it so that a market solution is incapable of delivering the ideal amount of the good  And this argument is flawed  simply because it has no basis there is nothing special about it that does not apply to other industries  and this argument is WHY we are in this mess in the first place If we treated Healthcare like we did every other industry then the prices would be going DOWN not UP  I think that everyone should have Major Medical  catastrophic high deductible plans that kick in at something like   deductible They should also have Medical Savings account where they put the remainder of what they save from the premium drop for the catastrophic plan That way every single thing that costs less than    e g prescriptions doctors visits etc    will have the full force of  million Americans shopping around driving the costs down 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nothing controls costs better than a monopoly 
PoliticalDiscussion,in ter pret in t rprit  Verb       Explain the meaning of  information words or actions  judge  Verb Form an opinion or conclusion about  Laws contain words  The intent of these words by congress and endorsed by the President is to communicate an idea  Someone is called to be judged as to whether the law applies to them for their specific case The JUDGES INTERPRET the law to see if it does  Under the precedent of judgments by a court the law has now changed to suit the judgment  If Zimmerman goes to court and says under the stand you ground law I was justified and was within my rights and it is found he pursued Martin the court can judge that this law does not apply to his circumstance  They interpret the meaning of the law that it states pursuing someone is not standing your ground  Thus the law has changed to include an interpretation of what  stand your ground means 
PoliticalDiscussion,He knows the R field is weak and the economy is gaining ground  If I were him I wouldn t be sweating much either 
PoliticalDiscussion,The cost of Medicare is artificially set by congress its cost doesn t move with the market  The very reason private healthcare spending is increasing is because it is paying for the shortfall that medicare doesn t provide  Private subsidizing medicare  Because medicare is squeezed in its expansion the excess flows to the private spending  And the cost of procedures in other counties is masked by subsidies  The cost is similar nonetheless 
PoliticalDiscussion,They are not voting against their own personal interests It is good that you feel the way you vote is in your interest but I tend to disagree with much of your assessment and hence I will vote the other way I feel it is in my interest  For instance Increasing Spending has improved the amount of jobs available I suppose you could argue that unemployment has gone down for other reasons 
PoliticalDiscussion,You completely disregarded everything I said Not one of your bullet points addresses my point that competition drives down costs thereby making healthcare cost drastically less for everyone both those that have time to shop around and those that do not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Health Care is not a consumer good because    It is typically only consumed under duress incapacitation or the like  Unlike Lasik or Elective Plastic Surgery health care is a need not a want  In fact it is a stronger need than the typical Food Shelter Water basic needs because in many situations without Healthcare one will not need those other basic needs as they will be dead  Similarly Health care is often needed immediately  There is no time for price shopping when you have a sucking chest wound  And in a free market system what is to stop the first  and only doctor you make it to form charging you  million to fix you and then just taking all of your assets when you come to and you file for bankruptcy    There are no alternatives or substitutes  One cannot choose to forgo chemotherapy in favor of some similar but less expensive option in the way a person can forgo owning a large home in favor of a small apartment    Certain  consumers are completely price insensitive  Patients with severe chronic or terminal illnesses have no incentive to seek out a lower cost alternative because even the lowest cost alternative will bankrupt them anyway  There is simply no possible way for this population to purchase the needed care on their own given the  market cost of procedures      A Consumer needs highly specialized knowledge to know what is necessary and what is not  A Layperson is not qualified to determine if a test is needed or not  Or to decide whether or not they should get surgery  Or if they can live with a broken bone         Remember healthcare is different because i almost everybody wants to have as little of it as possible ii the more in need of it the consumers are the less capable they are of making their own decisions Does that sound like any other consumer good No it sounds like market failure We need a system that is optimized to keep people away from the hospitals and procedures  get them to avoid consuming if they possibly can We need to focus on the promotion of proactive health not encourage the over consumption of reactive healthcare      
PoliticalDiscussion,It only takes a few    I remember a time when a teacher that I did not care for went off about the fact that  In my  years of teaching I ve only known a handful of students that were actually interested in learning in growing in active involvement in their education            and I nodded my head in agreement  So he saw that and said  So you agree             and I replied     Well in part  In my  years of being a student I ve only met a handful of teachers in that same category     Yeah real world education is vital but without a good foundation it s hard to build one    
PoliticalDiscussion,The insurance exchanges will act as group plans The ACA also provides additional financial support for healthcare for those that need it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Then you would expect to see the cost of Medicare rising faster than with private spending which is the opposite of what is observed Also look at Ezra Klein s recent article on healthcare prices We pay multiple times as much per procedure as other countries so even if we had the same number of procedures  and it is not clear that this isn t the case we would still have healthcare that is prohibitively expensive 
PoliticalDiscussion,How do we get more to do so 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt voting AGAINST their own interests by supporting liberal candidates and or causes   gt save the anti conservative arguments for another place  This is like saying  accept my thesis even if flawed or infactual because I don t want to lose this argument If you disagree go away  Sheesh 
PoliticalDiscussion,Re Comcast NBC  This Vertical integration by definition allows for greater market share  The expediency of product to market not to mention the factored out costs of negotiating programming allows for greater profits  This was facilitated by the government  Just like a paper company buying a  forest   The company no longer has to pay the profit margin of the owner of the property  As for what I posted re competition  The implication is when these occurrences never happen  in reality they never do  other forms of competition creep in  But our premises seem to be deviating from the original question    Take Comcast  as it is now  Wouldn t it be better to take the cost savings of the merger and a lot of it to the workers than the executives and stock holders  This would allow the workers  way more people to engage in business transactions with Comcast i e purchase higher premium packages etc which increase the value of the stock in the long run  a sort of trickle up affect   
PoliticalDiscussion,As a young American who very much understands your argument here is my response as to why I will not vote for Republicans     Medicare   Bullshit  Republicans under Bush crammed through Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits that added hundreds of billions of dollars unfunded liabilities to the budget In contrast Obama had to fight tooth and nail against Republicans to deliver an Obamacare package which actually   reduces  costs in the long run and reduces the deficit Democrats had wanted to cut costs even further by eliminating the need for private insurance companies and by allowing medicare to negotiate over bulk prescription drug purchases Republicans wouldn t allow it As a voter there is no reason to believe that Republicans are for decreasing healthcare costs    Increased Deficit Spending   Bullshit As you mentioned Bush exploded the deficit and actually Republicans have very strong modern history starting with Reagan of spending uncontrollably and racking up the deficit Yes Obama has increased the deficit more than Bush but Bush was handed a good economy and zero wars and then he handed Obama a crumbling economy and  wars I don t agree with government support of specific businesses either but the reality outside of your Republican propaganda bubble is that defense industry spending is exponentially higher than any spending you can attribute to Democrats and Republicans are therefore even more guilty than Democrats of creating our deficit problem Plus I believe that defense spending past a certain point of guaranteed security is a waste you are literally just blowing up your money I would much rather spend some of that money on domestic infrastructure projects that would make our country more economically competitive to attract businesses and jobs    Unions   Yes there are the anecdotes of union excess but obviously there are also anecdotes of abuse by employers and especially where you have situations where a single company is the dominant employer for an area  for example a coal mining town in Appalachia or a factory town in the Midwest the union s monopoly on labor is necessary to prevent exploitation of the company s monopsony on labor 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh yeah there are a few good teachers but talk to any  year old person and ask them how much of their public school experience is relevant to their day to day life   At any rate I didn t mean to detour the discussion into the value of public schools I was just saying that my comment above was more about real world education 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I will differ on the bland facts in public schools as my personal experience with many teachers has shown me otherwise 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure why you are being downvoted seeing as you re right Obama threw the public option under the bus at the first possible chance he had 
PoliticalDiscussion,ACA isn t preventing Vermont from implementing their single payer bill There is specific provisions in ACA to allow this sort of thing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Neither party is an especially conformable place the election is a long way off further election year rhetoric is always skewed hyperbolic  Quite the opposite I m sure the russian leadership understands the nuances of the sitting president s context 
PoliticalDiscussion,As far as I know neither of them is they both seem to want to keep expanding and expanding  But I was referring to actual real world education not the memorization of bland facts that goes on in schools 
PoliticalDiscussion,Spewing  year old rhetoric is the mainstay of every politician regardless of party And correlation does not mean causation or  doesn t require relationship 
PoliticalDiscussion,And what party is trying desperately to cut back on education  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Supreme Court already expanded it s boundaries within it s first  decades of existence Marbury v Madison allows the Supreme Court the power of Judicial Review never given in the Constitution the Supreme Court also is seen to overstep it s bounds with Judicial Activism however in many cases this improves the conditions of the majority of the US especially concerning Minority s  In the Civil Rights movement the S C were critical to it s successes especially early on in the  s with Brown v Board etc so whilst it has become unrecognizable since  it s necessarily a bad thing Due to not being an elected body the Supreme Court can often protect freedom s much better than Congress or the President who are always worried about losing their constituents votes one can see this in Snyder v Phelps  about protesting the war outside a soldiers funeral the public opinion was in favour of the Soldier s family however the Court ruled in favour of the Protesters as it would be a violation of their Freedom of Speech   If that had been decided by an elected body it would almost definitely infringed on freedoms  So yes the S C has changed dramatically from  however the precedents are actually protecting freedom s and not harming them  Note Bush v Gore Gore took the matter to the S C so it wasn t legislating from the bench as they were forced to make a ruling on it because it was a ruling you disagreed with doesn t make the S C in the wrong
PoliticalDiscussion, I see you did not read about EMTLA  Preventative care is not covered     Food is different from medical care  I can grow my own tomatoes  I cannot remove my own ruptured appendix   Market based solutions are only viable for those with money to enter the market and therefore those without money are not covered  Just another reason why  the market is not the answer for all of society s needs   Your empty gas tank did not threaten your life     
PoliticalDiscussion,I assume when Obama says he ll have more flexibility after the election he s talking about the placement of NATO missile defense systems 
PoliticalDiscussion,The main argument is that health care is a unique good and has special properties that make it so that a market solution is incapable of delivering the ideal amount of the good which is why a single payer health plan works differently from a single payer cell phone plan  BTW I m not sure if you finished reading my post but I don t actually support a single payer plan  I don t think rising health care costs are a problem at all so I don t think we should try to reduce them  But the fact that single payer plans reduce costs is pretty undeniable regardless of how much merit the idea has 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are young Americans like myself who think that one good solution would be to raise taxes to pay for all the stuff that we seem to want But no one wants to raise taxes because people don t like having their taxes raised so instead we get a bunch of unsustainable programs and a government that s swimming in debt  A lot of young people are just looking out for their future selves why would I want to cut a program that I want to be in place when I m old We see the problem with Medicare Medicaid to be one of funding rather than spending and the obvious solution would be to raise taxes  or at least to stop lowering them 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why are our emergency rooms filled with sick   injured people who can t pay for their care  Because it COSTS so much to have preventative care Why does it cost so much Because it is covered by insurance so NO ONE CARES how much it costs to go to X Y or Z doctor so they can set prices wherever they want and the free market has ZERO influence on prices  If you remove all non major medical costs from insurance and have them paid for out of pocket  or via a health savings account  then the costs overall will plummet and then those poor people could actually AFFORD to go have them done   gt Market based solutions are very good for the things we want but a poor remedy for many of the things we need   Yeah its a good thing the free market does not handle necessities you know like FOOD   gt Based on market based solutions I really should have let my wife die a few years ago because the expense of keeping her alive did not nearly come close to the revenue she will bring in for the remainder of her life  You don t understand market based solutions We spend plenty of money on things that will not pay for themselves everything from iPads to cell phones simply because we enjoy them Your saying that medical bills for your wife are not worth it because she will not pay them back over her lifetime is an idiotic straw man   gt If I am diagnosed with some illness that suddenly renders me unable to travel limits my cognitive ability and prohibits me from working to earn income how do I then go shopping for a cure treatment  Guess what Yesterday I was in the exact same situation except it was my gas empty light Did I have time to shop around and find a good deal on gas No I had to go to the first gas station I could find but guess what That gas station had prices that were within pennies of the going market rate because if it did not then those that were NOT in critical need of gas  those that planned ahead better than I did would not buy from them so they had to keep their rates competitive all the time  This exact same concept applies to medical care If an X Ray at hospital X costs more than it does at hospital Y then those that can chose where they get an X Ray will go to the one that is cheaper causing the one that is more expensive to have to lower their costs to attract them back That lowering of costs benefits not only the plan aheaders but also the emergency patients 
PoliticalDiscussion,That statement is obviously weak more weak than realistic Do you take Russian presidents for morons 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social policy does bear correlation with their ability to adapt and consider new ideas rather than spewing  year old rhetoric 
PoliticalDiscussion,Education is important   years ago nobody even recognized the problems  Nobody was even considering drug legalization  Nobody was challenging protectionist work laws   Now this stuff is common and making progress   The parties are slowly figuring this stuff out as people become educated   They can t ignore common sense and the voters forever 
PoliticalDiscussion,What and he should project to Russia he is weak and won t be around to continue the discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It seems like it will tie reimbursements to profit but it doesn t seem to give insurance any more leverage over providers than they already have  That is why we need to unleash the power of  million consumers on the providers If every consumer had a vested interest in what their healthcare costs you would see major competition taking place and prices would plummet 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Health Care is not a consumer good Laser Eye Surgery and Plastic Surgery are luxury consumer goods  What makes one a consumer good and one not 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it is urgent to know whether racism was actually involved in the Florida killing Should we force Zimmerman to take an fMRI lie detector exam on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if you saw a man at McDonald s choking on a burger and you knew the Heimlich maneuver what would your libertarian approach be   Let him die as free man   Impose your morals on him and save his life   Ask him how much he would pay you to save his life and use free market principles to come to an agreement   gt So yes if charities run out of money because resources are limited people are going to die  What if resources are only limited because of the selfish priorities of a privileged elite

PoliticalDiscussion, gt    not force others into paying for your medical bills    The way you use the word force it has lost all meaning You want to hold onto your ignorance or do you want to actually  look at reality These is no false dichotomy There are people who charities consider able to pay yet still will not buy insurance What do you want to do with them       
PoliticalDiscussion,Seriously   take the whole Global Warming issue their whole plan revolves around making energy more expensive for everyone in order to cut Carbon output   OR big programs to sequester CO   while this is important the economic considerations are important and far reaching  I know most people are like  WE GOT TO SAVE THE PLANET       but the solutions to do so aren t even feasible 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just playing devil s advocate here If the government manufactured guns and passed a law requiring me to buy one of their guns that would be ok  Not being a smart ass Just trying to wrap my non lawyer brain around this issue Thanks  Edit Better example If the law required you to buy into Medicare if you didn t have private insurance would that be ok It s not a commercial product 
PoliticalDiscussion,What I meant by true Republican i didn t mean the airheads we have in congress today I should have said anti federalist The original group of people who came to this country and were deciding the future of America The ones that tried the confederacy and realized it didn t work Same guys who scratched the confederacy and wrote the constitution leading to prosperity in America  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes it relates to the topic sentence of the article 
PoliticalDiscussion,Your answer doesn t seem to relate to the question of this thread in any way 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt if you think a lot of people are like children then we should change the mindset of these people then   You re not that naive are you Change that mindset and our corporate society collapses And you do not have the power to fight them     gt if you don t buy medical insurance then you ll have to face the consequences someday if resources from charities run out   That is  not the status quo What option are you arguing for     gt Either you are against both or you want these options something for nothing someone else pays for you or an inhumane society 
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems like the OP is letting his own partisanship blind him by claiming these rulings were partisan 
PoliticalDiscussion,Based upon the political compass and my personal experiences listening to both presidential candidates contradicting themselves Obama included makes this political milieu much easier to define  This chart shows that there really is no difference between any of the presidential candidates Where Obama was more centrist when elected he is now positioned exactly where he opponent was in the previous candidacy   
PoliticalDiscussion,Bingo  Just like Social Security  retirement portion not disability  especially considering the fact that better options exist in terms of where you can stuff your retirement funds  I personally believe the TSP is a better program and should replace SSI  It s your money you should keep it  If you die it should go to your kids not  back in the pot  
PoliticalDiscussion,You cannot compare gasoline with medical care  I can get by without ever needing to personally buy gasoline  I cannot get by without never needing to visit the doctor  You haven t addressed why doctor s or hospitals would even offer highly specialized drugs  There is no incentive for providers to try to treat or cure rare diseases because it will be much more likely that someone who cannot afford to pay will require treatment than someone who can afford to pay  And don t even think about comparing it to luxury consumer goods  Specialized medicine is not the same as a Bentley  A Kia and a Bentley will get you from A to B in the same way  But I can t replace my antiretroviral with Tylenol   So people with rare diseases die   gt HEALTHCARE YOU CAN CHOSE TO EAT HEALTHIER TO CUT COSTS  Oh yeah I ll just choose to stop having Lupus or Down Syndrome or AIDS  That ll cut my costs down   The best comparison  The United States Postal Service  UPS DHL FedEx all subcontract their remote package delivery to the USPS because its not profitable for them to go to bumfuck Nevada or New Mexico or Alaska  What happens without the USPS  No mail delivery to those places  or delivery that is so expensive to render it effectively so  
PoliticalDiscussion,All the difference in the world The entire argument of the unconstitutionality of the individual mandate is based around the fact that the federal government is requiring citizens to purchase a private product which has never been done before Theoretically if the federal government has the power to make you purchase private health insurance then it has the power to force you to buy anything else   Justice Roberts used an example of cell phones to call  for example 
PoliticalDiscussion,It ll certainly be a landmark case I m curious if SCOTUS strikes down the law whether or not they ll write it in such a way that it narrows the parameters to just health care A large part of the government s argument was that health care is unlike any other type of marketplace or commerce They might try their best to ensure that the Pandora s Box you were talking about isn t flung open 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a good premise because it becomes easier to discuss the moment we start separating the federalist system with the power of the local State governments   I personally think a federal mandate is intrinsically a good idea for fly over states and states with low GDP But I can think of a lot of States who could very well cover this social cost In fact when it comes down to what is unconstitutional doesn t mean that a State cannot override such a statute with its own provided that it is supported by that State s constitution  Washington State has written in their constitution that citizens can put initiatives into the Senate and that they must be taken as precedence before all other legislation  Besides all that back to your topic is this States Rights  gt Federal Government Federal Government can help provide a baseline that s about as efficient as they can mandate imo State run Hospitals like  Harbor View in Seattle offer free emergency medical service ER The State pays for it  why Because it s the humane thing to do also it is a training hospital The federal government should not be allowed to force a private practice to accept patients unless there are no publicly funded hospital in the area to service them That is why there are plenty of charitable and public medical hospitals that do this service already 
PoliticalDiscussion,As a right libertarian my thoughts on Unions are as follows great in the private sector piss poor in the public one  Personally wrt teachers fire and police you have a choice spend more and get more or spend less and get less  This is a decision best left to the voters and their elected officials  Far too often public sector unions end up playing  both sides of the table using their political connections to support candidates who are willing to provide concessions at the expense of fiscal responsibility  It holds the electorate hostage and creates a very divisive political atmosphere which creates a moral dilemma  how do you fight a teachers police fire union without looking like your pissing on those people  One candidate will support them fully even if it s fiscally unfeasible and the other will be treated as a Grinch out to crush children let rapists own the streets and burn your homes down   In New Jersey this is a huge issue for our state especially considering the Constitutional obligation to education and how this complicates cost controls  In many instances I feel that unions end up becoming an obstacle to any meaningful change  I don t know how to fix it   but I must say what happened in Wisconsin appears to be having benefits in regards to how small towns manage their ED budgets   the plan seemed reasonable to me as an outsider 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That s why people have to plan ahead for things   I don t know whether you are stupid or just ignorant People want to act like little children they won t do the right thing because they never grew up and expect some patriarch this law to make things all right Who pays The ADULTS    Either you are against both or you want these options something for nothing someone else pays for you or an inhumane society Which option are you arguing for 
PoliticalDiscussion,As someone who has been on both sides of the fence  now currently leaning a LOT more towards conservative at least as far as economic policy goes  I can somewhat understand liberal reasoning  Without going into too much detail I think it boils down to  simple ignorance of economic policy and  not being provided with a better idea that fits within the boundaries of  fairness in the context of social liberalism  Liberals care  a lot about the disadvantaged and are intensely concerned with providing economic  equality for them through social welfare programs such as Medicare  The problem is that a lot of them  especially the younger ones  don t seem to factor in the enormous costs of providing such safety nets and they all but ignore their potential for abuse  They are afraid of privatization because they feel private industry is a giant uncaring monster that only sees dollar signs not people and thus can t be trusted to provide for the common welfare  On top of all this the socially conservative policies that are so popular among Republicans right now  anti gay marriage anti abortion etc  create a stigma so bad that it turns most young voters away even if they agree with their economic policies  to be honest I m right there with them     So you re pretty much dead on with your assumption that young voters base their vote solely on social issues  
PoliticalDiscussion,How are they different They are both insurance plans 
PoliticalDiscussion,What difference does that make 
PoliticalDiscussion, 
PoliticalDiscussion,What happens if the man dies at week     Can the woman abort the child then  If men have these rights do the parents of minors have these rights  If my  year old son knocks up your  year old daughter can I make her keep the child  What happens if the woman dies in labor  Does the man become responsible for her other dependents  He did force her into the situation that caused her death  If the man DOES disappear can she then have the abortion  Or does she have to wait for him to return  She has to cease all activities that could harm the product    Does that include driving Working  Going into certain neighborhoods  Does that mean she effectively becomes the man s property until the child is born  Does she have to provide the man with breast milk  Does she have to stay to feed the child  
PoliticalDiscussion,You can hardly blame unions for creating unemployment Globalization and automation are WAY more important drivers in that arena We don t need as many low skilled workers and they aren t going to be able to demand high wages in manufacturing The Unions themselves are struggling with these realities    The cost of labor is negligible in many goods You could build the iphone in the US for just an additional  added on to the price of each phone The important thing is the supply chains and the flexibility of factories    
PoliticalDiscussion,That may be but as soon as Trayvon decided to assault instead of submit Florida s laws allow you to stand your ground    I doubt Zimmerman would have made the decision to kill him if he wasnt being brutally assaulted   And as  Damning as the  calls are I will remind you Police Dispach   Police and anything they tell you to do  like not follow is not legally binding    Its a fucked up situation and I dont agree with it but its really the laws I dont agree with   The outcome so far is understandable given the laws though  Again I still think they should have arrested him regardless of the law and even if he was ultimately proven innocent though   that s still really bizarre to me that he wasnt at least brought in until more of an investigation was done 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt what gives people the right to strip that choice from me   In capitalism  and reality people are refusing to pay for a service that  is highly likely they will use at some point in your life From your position should I assume you are against this law that forces service providers to provide these services Even if you are the society as a whole is not as heartless as you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes it is a mandate It actually might be brought into question since the Supreme Court is looking into the threat by the Feds to give no medicaid money if the states don t implement the plan But maybe since it is a state and we are talking about private enterprise it might be different 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope Hospitals are not fined if they choose not to serve people in ERs They simply lose funding 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt health risks   with modern technology the risk of pregnancy is minimal if all possible precautions   which will be paid for by the man   Straight up lie   Pregnancy is always risky Sometimes it s low risk other times it s high risk but there is always a fair amount of risk involved and is in no way minimal   You are also forgetting the most important part here what about the woman s right to control what happens to her own body 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If I want to take a gamble with my own life and not buy insurance     But that is not the position most people and I ll bet you too take when they are severely injured lying in the street 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but we do have a right to the child no man has the right to a child  You just contradicted yourself here Are you saying the man does or does not have a right to the child   gt ethically you cant use sex as a discriminating factor in this circumstance  I m not The discriminating factor here is the fact that the woman is pregnant It is her body Thus she and only she has the right to decide what happens to her body   gt The issue here is when two consenting adults decide to practice making babies and it happens   this is not about rape    What s your point In this case the situations are not different The woman is pregnant It s her body thus it s her choice 
PoliticalDiscussion,No They are very different things That would have to be looked at by the supreme court on a later date for it to be overturned It would almost never happen though 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would argue no because Hospitals and Medical Professionals have a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability   I m scared shitless for what s in the Pandora s Box this case could potentially open about government regulation and mandates in the private sector Specifically in the realm of Auto Insurance  my state requires No Fault  and compulsory education Certainly a landmark case for the history books  
PoliticalDiscussion,Hospitals are already engaged in the business of interstate commerce  i e  by charging for medical services including services to persons who cross state lines   Persons who do not purchase insurance are not already engaged in interstate commerce  The entire debate is whether the health care insurance industry is special  due to the presupposition that people will regardless need health care at some point  and whether that justifies forcing people to buy insurance  J Roberts made this point yesterday in re cell phones  Can the federal gov t require individuals to purchase cell phones on the presupposition that cell phone communication will be necessary at some point  e g to respond to a medical emergency to alert police to a crime etc    There was no discussion about whether the cell service providers are justifiably regulated b c those providers are already engaged in interstate commerce  Edit Minor Corrections 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure what you are trying to get at  If the baby is born then obviously the woman cannot extort the man by threat of abortion Bring up the extortion threats during the custody hearing and she loses custody of the child   If she has an abortion That was her decision unfortunately It s her body 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt acorns are not trees  Good A fetus is not a person Glad we agree   gt There is no difference between an oak tree and an acorn with respect to time   if you crush an acorn you are killing something that would have become an oaktree   it is a third category    You just stated that an oak tree and an acorn are not the same Thus if you crush an acorn you have only destroyed an acorn It could possibly have become an oak tree in the future but right now it is just an acorn 
PoliticalDiscussion,sorry you had a second question    doctors appointment   paid  for by the man possibly maternity leave   paid for by the man health risks   with modern technology the risk of pregnancy is minimal if all possible precautions   which will be paid for by the man 
PoliticalDiscussion,Solution Nuclear power Its green  france does it  and if youre smart about it safe What we learned from japan is DONT BUILD A NUCLEAR PLANT ON A FAULT LINE    Japan doesnt have a choice for that but we do We could build reactors in places that arent disaster prone like New Mexico or Minnesota and if we arent idiots about it a three mile island wont occur 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure you have all the information of cost there  Thats where subsidies are confusing who builds the hospitals how much debt do doctors have do they pay for school themselves or does government pay for them  Is the medical equipment bought by government or is it purchased by private industry   Cost includes all aspects of business and training 
PoliticalDiscussion,acorns are not trees   but a planted and fertilized acorn can become a oak tree and nothing but     There is no difference between an oak tree and an acorn with respect to time   if you crush an acorn you are killing something that would have become an oaktree   it is a third category      something that can become fertilized  something that is fertilized and will become something else with time as the only consideration  something that has become its final product and can only grow stronger 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt he has to do legally is pay the woman half of the accrued cost of the child from the beginning of conception  This blows apart the argument that the fetus is not a child  perhaps share the cost of her condition     gt morally he has a lot of apologizing to do to the child    I wasn t in a place to be responsible nor am I now  Your mother saw that she was  There s no guilt of abandonment     gt the child would then have the benefit of having two parents that want to be in the relationship  Sometimes this isn t a benefit
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You re born into it  Sorry but no one can be born into a legitimate contract A newborn baby cannot grant consent 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats not republicans   Thats supply and demand If china will buy gas at  a gallon and we will only pay   ehy the hell would oil conpanies sell here 
PoliticalDiscussion,And what of those people for whom there is no one to donate  
PoliticalDiscussion,Wait so she is a centrist at best What is she at worst  I shouldn t even respond  I m sorry its clear you have very little knowledge on both subjects I do encourage you to keep reading though   
PoliticalDiscussion,absolutely   if the male wants the kid s then he would pay for everything dealing with the pregnancy   even gym memberships to get the woman down to pre baby weight 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government can subsidize hospitals in any way it chooses Why would it be unconstitutional for them to offer a subsidy 
PoliticalDiscussion,You mean a library There usually are computers there 
PoliticalDiscussion,this is a point that is worth arguing   i wasn t focusing on it right now  but my guess  would be that there should be a middle ground on this as well   if the man wants no part then he doesn t get any rights to the child   if he wants to get involved then all he has to do legally is pay the woman half of the accrued cost of the child from the beginning of conception   legally that is    morally he has a lot of apologizing to do to the child    but now thinking about it   the child would then have the benefit of having two parents that want to be in the relationship and the cost would make sure that the parent wasnt there on a whim   
PoliticalDiscussion,Its  good idea in theory but you just know people would abuse that or you would have accusations of the government forcing people to read certain things which is bullshit but would happen  and besides tere are libraries 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know you made this comment two weeks ago but I still want to make two points   There are two solid theories IMO that relate to how to make people become less selfish and awful The first is by fulfilling their basic needs When people are not afraid they are less likely to go primal and more likely to make decisions based on reason  This is an argument for bigger government The second is by giving people responsibility and control A spoiled kid acts like a prick because he knows his decisions have no consequences He s angry because his life seems pointless By contrast if Daddy is smart enough to cut his son off he may lash out and act awfully for a while but there s also the decent chance that he ll recognize the significance that choices have on others and grow up and become a better person This is an argument for a smaller government one that doesn t promise to protect you but instead asks you to protect yourself THis is of course an argument for a smaller govt   I am with you through about  s of this but I lose you when you start talking about how our government  needs to look out for its people I guess your theory is that free and fair elections hold lawmakers accountable but I don t think there s much evidence for this as it is entirely based upon the notion that the electorate can judge character and that people who appear to have character will continue to exhibit that  character once elected I don t know that that s a solid theory in a world where we everything gets spun where even the spin gets spun and then spun again It takes a lot of effort to see through the bullshit effort that only a small minority of people are willing to make 
PoliticalDiscussion,true but the baby will still be born by the time the judicial system gets it figured out 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not saying it is constitutional or not I can understand the argument saying that it is What I m wondering is whether the same applies to emergency room visits for people who can t pay 
PoliticalDiscussion,No because Medicare is not a commercial product 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not sure I mean it is possible however I don t believe so In any event war is an atypical example as we can view this as an emergency transfer The point being that a regular operating adminstration can not us Social Security funds for anything other than Social Security pay outs This is why Social Security has such a large surplus 
PoliticalDiscussion,One is dead One is not  Nuff said 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why should insurance participants pay for other people s healthcare That s the problem this is intended to solve  while maintaining the companies  right to obscene profits   And if our people were altruistic we wouldn t need taxes at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,I like it  your attitude that is not our current political predicament   The more I ve educated myself the more I ve learned that voting is one of the least effective things you can do to improve society however it s very easy to contribute to the continued homogenization and stagnation of society    I loath the phrase  your vote is your voice   It s totally untrue  Your voice is your voice and it s many times more effective than your vote     An interesting book  not great but at least well structured on the topic is  The Ethics of Voting    If you can stand the somewhat boring reading of walking through logic and philosophy it puts together a really great case for how to vote     Make sure you are voting with good intentions and with justification  accidentally voting for the  right candidate is fortuitous voting and should be avoided  unless you have something  really just about ANYTHING better to do    And I m rambling   sorry I hope some of that was relevant interesting 
PoliticalDiscussion,Which for all intents and purposes is essentially a mandate   but not in such explicit terms to be deemed unconstitutional I would imagine I believe that level of coercion is constitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,but we do have a right to the child no man has the right to a child   a woman cant have a child with out a man just the same way a man can t have a child without the woman   a woman didn t choose to be a woman and a man didnt choose to be a man   ethically you cant use sex as a discriminating factor in this circumstance  The issue here is when two consenting adults decide to practice making babies and it happens   this is not  about rape   
PoliticalDiscussion,Sally Field was the Flying Nun  
PoliticalDiscussion,How do you care for those without money in a cash based world 
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t fit the narrative obviously Black on white crime is  times higher than white on black crime no one cares and this fact receives no coverage because again it doesn t fit the narrative   Diversity is literally hazardous to your health the greatest representation of crime in an area is the percentage of blacks and hispanics something like an  correlation   Here s an excellent video by Bill Whittle  Aptly titled  The Narrative        Very recent incidents that will never move beyond local news LOL just imagine if the races were reversed seriously                   
PoliticalDiscussion,Your argument is if there wasn t certain ethnic groups there wouldn t be as much crime It s a complete argument made because of a persons ethnic background Therefore my argument is you sir are an idiot And I m being nice there 
PoliticalDiscussion,sorry about my timeliness i just worked two doubles    The question of the man changing his mind was one that I had not thought about   but let me answer the other questions first  my kids were admittedly  easy pregnancies  can the man just leave   no he is  responsible for the child  the man is responsible for the child just as a woman is responsible for the child if the man leaves  yes   legally the child becomes a product   we have surrogacy laws for this the only difference is that it is after conception  she would have to cease all activities that would harm the product   but the man would take care of the costs   nicotine patches etc   this agreement would would be a  agreement all costs to the woman would be incurred all the way to private gym memberships to lose the baby weigh  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Is it your assertion that our town s fire department would be better equipped to meet the needs of the local community if we all hired private companies  As a firefighter seeing how the government runs our fire department yes I believe that if fire departments were private industries paid for by residents then the efficiency of the fire departments would be higher than they are right now   gt Because health care fire protection police and so many things are different from rug markets ice cream stands and tattoo parlors  NO THEY ARE NOT That line of thinking is why we are throwing logic out the window when it comes to healthcare costs People keep thinking healthcare is different It is not A producer provides a service A consumer needs that service If the consumer has to pay the costs for the product then the consumer will do due diligence to find where the best costs are forcing the producer to maximize efficiency and provide the best value for the consumer If the consumer does not care how much the product costs then the producer can increase costs and not have to deal with customers leaving for their competition 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Imagine all the forms you d have to fill out the questions you d have to answer It would turn your healthcare into a numbers game   You obviously have never had to deal with a health insurance company to get reimbursed for something they don t want to cover 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s interesting I often see the opposite occurring poor people voting Republican which I believe will not serve their best interests  You and I have a very different understanding of issues around unions and government spending Where you see them as costly I see them as investments that will bring greater dividends and benefit society Also you use the word  entitlement to describe the Affordable Care Act Instead of seeing this as lazy people just wanting to live off of the work of others I see it as a way to ensure that those who need help to get back on their feet after a setback are able to   The thing that drives me crazy is how adamantly people oppose tax increases Republicans just seem blind to the fact that losing   in taxes per person translates into  billion dollars The amount of good that can be done with that amount is so much greater than what each individual can do even if they re dedicated to similar goals  It costs  million to build one mile of rural freeway and  million to build one mile of urban freeway  source   Looking at a rural freeway it costs   foot Collectively pooling resources to fund projects does such a greater service to a country than giving everyone more pocket money  I cringe when I think of poor people supporting tax cuts when they so greatly rely on government support in the form of food stamps college loans primary and secondary school education check out  this article   in the New York Times about the phenomenon it s quite interesting   Left wing socialist policies are designed to benefit the majority 
PoliticalDiscussion,LOL
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No The largest line item is Hospital Care  The largest SINGLE line item in that chart is healthcare but it is only   Almost all of the other line items  physician clinic professional services personal care nursing care home health care rx drugs etc    all fall under the category of things that can be shopped around for   gt Just because there is not a substitute for gasoline doesn t mean there isn t a substitute for your car If gas prices rise too high people will begin to walk ride bikes take public transport and the like  My point is that price competition works for Gasoline and it would work for Medical care if it were allowed The current system does not allow it therefore prices are skyrocketing   gt No it won t If there is an incredibly small demand for a drug or procedure it wil remain excessively expensive and will not be  diluted by the other spending because you will be paying for line items rather than paying into a pool of money  Except once again highly specialized drugs and procedures are not the bulk of the spending The bulk of spending is on things that you can get at almost any medical facility and therefore is able to have price competition   gt Because you don t die if you have a broken muffler Because you don t die if you go to a cut rate muffler service and they botch the job  All the more incentive for people to do due diligence in listening to the recommendation of their doctor   gt Food you can choose to cook at home or change your diet to cut costs  HEALTHCARE YOU CAN CHOSE TO EAT HEALTHIER TO CUT COSTS   gt Then why aren t insurance companies focusing on preventive care They aren t concerned with lowering costs   EXACTLY    They are not focusing on preventative care because when the stuff hits the fan and you have to go for a huge medical procedure they get a percentage of that spending Remember that Health Insurance companies have to justify their rate hikes What better way to justify raising your rates than by increasing the total amount of medical care that is siphoned through your insurance plan   gt everything changes when your life is on the line Everything changes when a poor decision now can affect the rest of your or other s lives  And using emotion to drown out logic is why we are heading in the wrong direction 
PoliticalDiscussion, I found this comment on another site that I think is relevant to your point      gt The weakness of the penalty for not buying insurance is fascinating   gt Suppose I make   per year If I choose not to buy any insurance my penalty will be  in  rising to   in    in  and thereafter  indexed to inflation  My individual premium would be much higher let s say   in  and increasing by  a year thereafter Also because of guaranteed issue I can buy an insurance policy any time I wish   gt So it seems to me the best strategy for  is not to buy insurance I thereby save    the difference between my premium and my penalty If my expenses are less than   I keep the savings in my pocket If I have an accident or have medical expenses likely to run more than    I can buy insurance at that time When I no longer have medical expenses that justify insurance I can then cancel my policy and return to paying the annual penalty   gt The same process would apply for subsequent years   gt Seems to me the only risk I am taking is that I might suffer some extraordinary accident which would cost me more than   before I could secure an insurance policy I think  though I m not certain of this  that risk can be covered by accident only term insurance which I expect would be relatively cheap   gt In effect I am regarding the penalty as my  insurance premium and am regarding guaranteed issue as my  insurance   I think at the end of the day people want the security of having health insurance It just has to be affordable enough for them to buy No one wants to get stuck with ridiculously high unexpected medical bills Even if you could get insurance for people with pre existing conditions you could be left with some serious bills to pay off for unexpected emergencies   The Healthcare law could have done a lot more to keep the benefits in line with the penalty Hopefully it doesn t ruin the system which overall could have led to lower health insurance premiums for everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,Union jobs  used to be middle class jobs Before Unions were mercilessly attacked and weakened blue collar jobs used to pay a living wage 
PoliticalDiscussion,Drop the police protection thing You also get help from the military in case of an invasion you get help from EMTs and Fire Rescue you get help from the Coast Guard etc  You get to use a standardized currency you can travel freely between states and use your standardized currency freely between states you get to take advantage of schools and hospitals parks public roads etc   gt No they didn t I never did and you never did   You obviously don t understand what a social contract is No one ASKS you if you want it You re born into it It exists because you were born into a State 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are talking about our specific time and place and government the US Government and Supreme Court  Zoom out a bit I m talking about States in generalized terms  not a specific one  States  
PoliticalDiscussion,Name calling is childish and has no place in r politicaldiscussion   If you can t make a valid counter argument or show flaws in my argument or in some other way genuinely add the debate then don t post anything   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt there aren t really replacement goods for an MRI or for an open heart surgery  No but there are  different hospitals in my area that have MRI units They can compete with each other for pricing on the same item they don t have to each provide a different item   gt i don t know about how popular having doctors with low relative survival rates being allowed to practice would be  It would be the same as grocery stores that sell items infested with salmonella They do it once and they are going to go out of business because that is all people will associate them with That alone is enough incentive to drive doctor s  survival rates  
PoliticalDiscussion,  HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CARE TO UNINSURED OR BLACK PEOPLE  
PoliticalDiscussion, Special characteristics of the health care market       The nature of demand  We only demand medical care when we re sick and the onset of sickness is unpredictable    Expected behavior of the physician  There s extreme asymmetry between the information had by the physician and the consumer consumers are often unable to test the product or shop around the physician is expected to treat the patient without regard for profit but with regard to professional conduct etc   Product uncertainty  There s tremendous uncertainty as to whether the product will work at all and as to the quality of life you ll have if the product does work  This makes it impossible for the average consumer to accurately value the good prior to purchase   Supply conditions  Generally the value of a good is the difference in return from the good s production and the use of the same resources elsewhere  Medical care departs from this theory in many ways  specifically in that licensing restricts entry to the field    Pricing Practices The unusual pricing practices of the health care industry are well known by readers of this subreddit I m sure  For a more lay man s take on the same subject  Paul Krugman    has the essential article 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That justification expired a couple years ago and deficits are still near  trillion per per year  What were the deficits before the stimulus   gt Your plan to pay it off doesn t even come close Run the numbers  It s not my plan it s his plan And it s currently closer than any other plan out there   gt Edit why didn t you answer my question     Bush  and Reagan both increased it more as a  of GDP than Obama Bush  increased it nearly the same amount as Obama when then the economy was growing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really  I d say you can t be this fucking stupid but I know better 
PoliticalDiscussion,So Romney is wrong  The supreme court has no understanding of the concept  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m hoping it does get repealed as it should once the individual mandate is repealed along with the Affordable Care Act  Then the truth of how awful our health care model is and we ll be able to join the rest of the developed world with st Century Single Payer Universal Health Care 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush asked the Supreme Court to intervene it was Gore who appealed to the Florida courts and again you may not have agreed with it actually you definitely don t agree with it It was a coup d  tat by the felonious five and nothing less but the fact was they did have legal justification for it under the th Amendment Gore wanted a recount of just the Democrat area s and under the Equal Protection clause there was no statewide method of counting and so was illegal under the th Amendment  Though you may think it s a grab for power and it may have been but the fact is that the court had good justification for ruling in the manner that it did and I would say it would have been more of a coup d  tat if the Courts had ruled in Gore s favour as it would have actually gone someway to changing the election results  rigged or not rather than keeping it the same Either way the general point stands that the Supreme Court has gained power but that power does notharm freedoms in any way shape or form but rather preserves them
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Since the corporations are people  No need to continue reading your statement you obviously have no understanding of the concept 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s not The economy is getting better but it s not there yet And there are several plans that people are putting forward to reduce the deficit and debt The differences occur on what to cut  So Obama s summer of recover was a lie    
PoliticalDiscussion,Some ask me  What if nobody voted   Well then I would fucking vote the fuck outta that shit But my not voting won t magically convince other people not to vote
PoliticalDiscussion,FYI Obama has spent more in  years then Bush did in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Increased spending also distorts the market and causes inflation It may be good in the short term but in the long term it is bad 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s legal to walk thru a neighborhood  The claim in question was that Martin was running through backyards which would be trespassing and illegal  
PoliticalDiscussion,Not all parts of the government are unionized
PoliticalDiscussion,Most republicans from what I tell want to end forced unions Many are fine with voluntary unions 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Unions are as follows great in the private sector  Unions are only great in the private sector if they are voluntary to join Some states force people to join because of their profession 
PoliticalDiscussion,Arrest  em you got a gun 
PoliticalDiscussion,So anyone with a CCW permit needs to be a completely isolated shut in  I think you need to re read what you wrote 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t consider  year old writings or  year old writings without question     gt I know you don t value the Constitution being the supreme law of the land but it is   Not  your misinterpretation no 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt An entire state  or a nation is a much bigger group than one employer so there would be even bigger discounts no  Are you a fan of monopolies in general  Because of the steep discounts 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If they just paid you the money instead or put it towards your healthcare taxes it wouldn t change the balance sheet  Yes it would  They d lose out on the tax breaks that incentivize employer based insurance to begin with 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is not democracy when they don t follow their own laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,I want to live in a democracy The government however must abide by their own rules  the Constitution  They can force me to do anything they please assuming it actually follows the Constitution  I know you don t value the Constitution being the supreme law of the land but it is 
PoliticalDiscussion,No at issue is the  responsibility for causing the harm   That is what would have to be established as part of a trial  Regardless of the fact that Zimmerman shot Martin the case hinges on who is actually the  aggressor in a legal sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very well said 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well there s the other problem   But he said he d reform taxes and he s done nothing What he s done isn t bad its what he hasn t done 
PoliticalDiscussion,Santorum actually said that Zimmerman ought to be arrested 
PoliticalDiscussion,Do you not want to live in a democracy The government cannot force you to do anything that is not democratically decided I realize it is hard to live in a world where the majority think you re an idiot Keep talking maybe you ll get most people to agree with you    I can t make you reason for yourself Only you can do that 
PoliticalDiscussion,i m not saying obama shouldn t held accountable for his words  what i m saying is the line that was over heard isn t damning  has he deceived anyone about his stance on the negotiations  i don t really know the details of his stance or even the negotiations just that they are related to missile defense  but you keep framing this as obama saying one thing then changing his mind when as far as i am aware he never said a first thing to change from    if there is a public stance that obama has taken on these negotiations and he doesn t end up acting that way after the election then he s using the  etch a sketch tactic that romney s guys referred to  has he declared a public stance    as i see it now  obama said  i m not in a political position right now to act on my stance   romney s guys said  we don t have to do the things we said we would do or believe the things we said we believe   not the same gnome sane 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is what I was saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can you even debate when you do not know what democracy is    No doubt your ego is blowing up over your response I hate to tell you it is nonsensical 
PoliticalDiscussion,Innocent untill proven guilty in this context would mean that we take their word for it untill we have proof otherwise  Ninja edit Thank you for asking that I should have been more clear
PoliticalDiscussion,So the government can force you into any market they choose   Can they force you to buy a house or pay a fee Can they force you to buy a car or pay a fee Can they force you to eat healthy All of those would help your  mortal body  
PoliticalDiscussion,You can make choices to not purchase gas  You cannot make choices to not visit a doctor  I can choose to live downtown and take the metro everywhere   Why would the high deductible be any different from today s insurance plans that drop you once you become to expensive then bury you in court till you die   And FedEx and the rest would drop routes that aren t profitable  Many companies drop customers who aren t profitable Except in those industries you don t die   The many problem with your theory is it relies on rationality  People are inherently irrational when making decisions about healthcare 
PoliticalDiscussion,What I mean is is that the guilt  of causing harm  is established proven Only the circumstances of it are not     
PoliticalDiscussion,By the very nature of having a mortal body forces you into it Going to blame the gov mit for that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Great answer    I think you should give me all your money Reason democracy That is what your argument sounds like 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government cannot mandate insurance just like they can not mandate you to purchase auto insurance Can the government mandate you to eat healthy exercise sleep for  hours a day I mean all of those help you but the federal government has no right The states potentially have the right but that is questionable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Democracy 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The workers are voluntarily working there   If you hold that position I have to conclude you are not living in reality     gt That is holding the gun to your head    If you don t understand democracy and have allowed it to be redefined by those who exploit you I can t help you You want a world fit for emotionally stunted easily manipulated boys I can only hope you stay on the fringe 
PoliticalDiscussion, I was using this example simply because it is brought up a lot in the debate as an example of govt mandating insurance  However it is considered different based on the fact that you choose to participate in the market which can be regulated    You are not disproving my assertion you are strengthening it  
PoliticalDiscussion,EVERYONE  Please stop muddying state governments and the federal government  Thanks 
PoliticalDiscussion,The employers are not holding a gun The workers are voluntarily working there  The government is saying pay money or pay more and get something from it That is holding the gun to your head If you refuse to pay you will go to jail 
PoliticalDiscussion,No there s a difference and that s what SCOTUS is debating  Tacking on responsibilities to money is one thing  Penalizing people if they don t complete and action is another 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the government can force you into commerce then they can force you to give all your money to them They can force you to buy only products created by the government They can force you to pay every penny you have 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re an idiot   The shooting you are referring to was not racially motivated   The cops didn t let the shooter go  It kills me that I even have to point this shit out 
PoliticalDiscussion, The Congress shall have Power To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes  They would be forcing people into commerce not regulating it 
PoliticalDiscussion,What exactly is unconstitutional quote the line please  Isn t it possible you have misinterpreted it Or that the writers  years ago couldn t foresee where their  innocent statements would lead 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is the position of theories and institutes of learning Obviously it is not a fact that it is unconstitutional     It must be fun to debate such things without a care for the consequences 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about the low income people who spend all of their money on rent and food with nothing left for insurance  Do you think those people shouldn t have the right to medicine 
PoliticalDiscussion,Die or do what the rich say is not freedom no matter what delusion you hold to Be realistic man   You have bought into the manipulation that the government is holding the gun Grow up Wake up 
PoliticalDiscussion,There is a chance that there are people not in the market and as such even if it is   of the people who would be forced into the market it would be unconstitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,If they are so isolated then no one will know to fine them How can you support a position where millions suffer so  one person can think s he is free 
PoliticalDiscussion,The people who work for you  I assume that is what you mean by exploiting are voluntarily working for you The rich people do not hold a gun against your head like the government 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know that any constitutional arguments have addressed it in a positive negative framework  The federal gov t requires what is arguably positive action in many different interstate commerce situations  e g  auto manufacturers must post make available specifications qualified employers must post information on OSHA FMLA etc  SOX whistleblowing requirements etc    The thing to note though is that virtually every negative positive distinction collapses in on itself  Is the gov t car insurance requirement negative b c it restricts the option of driving sans liability inurance or positive b c it requires that the would be driver obtain inurance  Is an OSHA posting requirement positive b c it requires that the employer put up posters or negative b c it restricts the ability of the employer to run his business absent those posters  Etc  To the best of my knowledge the interstate commerce clause has never been interpreted in the positive negative framework 
PoliticalDiscussion,They will die no matter what the system we have The government will deem something unnecessary and the person will die 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are they eliminating catastrophic care insurance Because I can buy that now   it has a relatively high deductible but it is cheap and will keep you from going bankrupt if you get hit by a car    Oh and what about employer care I do not take my employer s health care plan   we buy it ourselves because it is cheaper by several hundred dollars per month 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  gt The government decree of car insurance is not that if you own a car you have to buy insurance but rather a regulatory restrictive they can restrict your use of a car unless you get insurance  That is where you are mistaken The federal government does not require auto insurance States do That is why Romneycare is more Constitutional then Obamacare  Also living is different than driving You don t need to drive to live you do need to live to live 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t understand stats do you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt For what reason should an individual not do this  Employer healthcare That isn t going to change for you but yes some people will get around the system Unfortunately you can t just buy catastrophic care only Your plan makes sense but it won t happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,It does not matter if it is unlikely 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t see what s so surprising about his comment    If he gets re elected he will have more flexibility That s the nature of being in your second term 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes that is what I am saying From a purely logical economical standpoint it makes better financial sense to reduce my coverage to the bare minimum  catastrophe only  pay the penalty and then buy coverage only when care is needed    For what reason should an individual not do this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Our entire country is frighteningly conservative So much so that foreigners regularly assume Democrats are the Conservative party and the GOP is the uber conservative party Comparing Pelosi to the House is like comparing me to an Albino and reaching the conclusion that I must be black 
PoliticalDiscussion,None of that even comes close to addressing case studies of deregulation and of socialistic policies They both run counter to your point that educated people are libertarian economically The world and history shows how the bad libertarian and deregulation policies are  Oh and I never said Keynesian was right I said its not discredited 
PoliticalDiscussion,Won t happen Are you assuming that all the people with insurance get off of their insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,So small as to be insignificant    gt Others have enough money and are healthy enough that they choose to pay for costs with cash   Isn t the law about ability to pay healthcare savings accounts set asides If not that could should be included And healthy Not for long with what we breathe and eat  even in rural areas 
PoliticalDiscussion,I make just about the median income and I m on the  repeal the tax cuts on the rich keep the tax cuts for the rest boat  More specifically I think we should keep the cuts on the   for now  The economy sucks people are struggling with bills the housing market is teetering  The last thing we should do is raise taxes on people who are struggling to get by  I m fortunate to have not lost my job in the past few years  My spouse is now substitute teaching more or less full time after not working at all for the previous school year If they d raised our taxes last year we d have been screwed  As it is we moved out of our house and into a much cheaper apartment and that was the difference in staying afloat  We don t need any more bills  In the long run all these tax cuts need to go away  The  can afford it now  Much of the  cannot or it would at least represent a significant hardship  I don t think the debt is such an imminent crisis that we must do away with the tax cuts now lest we turn into Greece  It s a long term problem that needs to be addressed soon but not now  In the meantime repealing the cuts on the very wealthy will not make them default on their mortgages but it will inject some much needed revenue to keep government services alive and teachers road workers policemen firemen etc employed  When unemployment gets down around normal levels and the housing market is on the rise then we can talk about raising taxes on the rest of us 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Potential pitfalls In a situation of actual self defense we are now placing an undue burden upon someone acting legally to prove it  That is your answer 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Innocent untill proven guilty Always Always Always  Say two guys are in the woods One guy attacks the other with a knife Other guy shoots him How is he supposed to prove innocence He s in the woods  Better that the guilty go free than the innocenct die  Answers to predicted counterarguments  Courts don t always work out right no shit such is life  What if someone manipulated that to get away with murder What if we put someone in jail who had no other choice I d like to err on the side of life  Edit for clarity We should take their word for it until we have air tight proof otherwise  Edit edit apparently this is not correct Please read down comments for a more correct explaination My apologies 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt So Romney is wrong   Romney is wrong on a lot of things   gt The supreme court has no understanding of the concept  No you have no understanding of the concept that the Supreme Court put forward in Citizens United 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obviously it wouldn t be enough   but it may cause enough of a short term crisis to initiate it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No Medicare is a government program like food stamps or Medicaid People pay additional taxes and that money is used to pay for the insurance benefit  The constitutional issue with the new healthcare mandate is whether the Federal government is forcing people to enter a market In defense of the bill they are saying everyone uses healthcare The government just wants people to pay in advance with insurance This would mean the government is just regulating existing commerce which it can do legally under the Interstate commerce clause  The critics of the bill are saying that the mandate is forcing people into a market It s preventing people from self insuring and making them buy a product they don t want Therefore it s a new definition of Congressional power under the Interstate commerce clause  Medicare has nothing to do with any of that It s a government benefit funded through taxes The government isn t compelling you to buy anything  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We only demand medical care when we re sick and the onset of sickness is unpredictable  I only demand mechanic work when my car has issues and the onset of that is unpredictable   gt There s extreme asymmetry between the information had by the physician and the consumer  Also exists between the information had by my mechanic and by me   gt consumers are often unable to test the product or shop around  In some cases yes but the majority of spending on healthcare is in settings where shopping around IS possible  preventative care checkups prescriptions non emergency doctors visits medical devices etc     Shopping around in those non emergency settings will cause prices to go down across the board even for those in emergency settings   gt Product uncertainty There s tremendous uncertainty as to whether the product will work at all and as to the quality of life you ll have if the product does work This makes it impossible for the average consumer to accurately value the good prior to purchase  they are not valuing the good against not buying the good they are valuing the good against other people that provide the same good   gt Medical care departs from this theory in many ways  specifically in that licensing restricts entry to the field   Yes I agree that Government Intervention in artificially lowering the supply of doctors and hospitals is causing a problem We need to fix that   gt The unusual pricing practices of the health care industry are well known by readers of this subreddit I m sure  And the cause of those unusual pricing practices is BECAUSE NO ONE WHO GOES IN CARES OR ASKS WHAT THE PRICE IS If you walked into a mechanic shop and said you need a new muffler and they said sorry we can t tell you how much it will cost you would turn around walk out and go somewhere else 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a big fan of judicial review as a principle and I think most of the time they get things right I would argue that the main problem is the heavily politicized nature of nominating justices  Jon Stewart in  America the Book said something like  It s all about appointing the craziest mother fucker the President can sneak by Congress    Cases are increasingly breaking along party lines and you re smart enough  which if you re on the Supreme Court you obviously are you can justify whatever you think as  constitutional   Which State of the Union was this I don t remember
PoliticalDiscussion,Well since I said the hospital situation could be in constitutional question I don t see what your point is    gt Actually   shit   If everyone just paid the penalty instead of carrying insurance would that cause a single payer system by default  No It wouldn t get enough income to pay for medical care for everyone 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How do you care for those without money in a cash based world  How do we care for those without money in the cash based world of food 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can you not see they are different If you don t understand that then I don t know if we can honestly have a conversation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know you re saying that but that doesn t answer my question Plus not everyone pays the Medicare tax 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I cannot get by without never needing to visit the doctor  Sure you can just that it is about as likely as you getting by without ever needing to purchase gasoline i e slim to none   gt You haven t addressed why doctor s or hospitals would even offer highly specialized drugs There is no incentive for providers to try to treat or cure rare diseases because it will be much more likely that someone who cannot afford to pay will require treatment than someone who can afford to pay   Catastrophic medical insurance plans such as    deductible  alongside medical savings accounts would still allow people to purchase highly specialized drugs   gt The best comparison The United States Postal Service UPS DHL FedEx all subcontract their remote package delivery to the USPS because its not profitable for them to go to bumfuck Nevada or New Mexico or Alaska  And why is it not profitable for them to do it Right because there is a monopoly preventing them from sending both packages and letters so they can t combine services to save money 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah It s weird how on reddit your not partisan if you are a Democratic appointed judge but you are a complete partisan if you were appointed by a Republican 
PoliticalDiscussion,True but at what a bang up job they did on Citizens United     I actually feel like the High Court has become far to politicized in the past  years especially recently when half the justices skipped a State of the Union 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt people who are not in the market are forced to buy it   The chance of living in a modern society and not being in this market at some point in a life is so unlikely as to be impossible 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Using force to plunder the few wealth elites that made the wealth themselves without government subsidies   You can t be wealthy without exploiting a whole lot of people with or without the  government  
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare costs more per person than other universal systems because healthcare in the US costs more per person     
PoliticalDiscussion,And most people know that any society limits an individual s freedom and liberty Except the society of one 
PoliticalDiscussion,The government workplace is  very white collar and  very unionized 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  Technically the best option for young people is no health coverage and no insurance premiums to pay or medicare taxes to pay  Wrong The best option right now is a job that provides health insurance Period 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m saying current law  not the ACA requires you to pay Medicare taxes and you re automatically covered once you become eligible  So you re already required to  buy Medicare  
PoliticalDiscussion,The reason the hospitals are required to treat was due to an expose  I think Chicago Tribune on hospitals that allowed people to die in the parking lots because they couldn t pay  So the  ingrained belief doesn t hold up
PoliticalDiscussion,For the last fucking time Social Security is solvent for the next  or so years  You know what the biggest problem is The curve for contribution to Social Security and Medicare stops at  k If we remove that cap then they d be solvent for longer 
PoliticalDiscussion,honest question  Can the government require a positive action or simply restrict actions  The government decree of car insurance is not that if you own a car you have to buy insurance but rather a regulatory restrictive they can restrict your use of a car unless you get insurance  Here by the hospitals it is not a restrictive mandate but a requirement to a positive action Is that allowed 
PoliticalDiscussion,From a constitutional standpoint I see your point    gt Can the federal gov t require individuals to purchase cell phones on the presupposition that cell phone communication will be necessary at some point  e g to respond to a medical emergency to alert police to a crime etc    Personally  unrelated to constitutionality question  I think that this would be a good idea  IF cell phone expenses caused as many problems for the economy and individuals as healthcare expenses did But of course they don t and it in no way represents a problem in need of solving as healthcare costs do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Any patient who  comes to the emergency department requesting  examination or treatment for a medical condition must be provided with  an appropriate medical screening examination to determine if he is suffering from an  emergency medical condition  If he is then the hospital is obligated to either provide him with treatment until he is stable or to transfer him to another hospital in conformance with the statute s directives    EMTALA  
PoliticalDiscussion,Then isn t the mandate just coercion too You could very well go uninsured you just might have to pay  bucks a year Which actually   is a hell of a lot cheaper than insurance    Actually   shit   If everyone just paid the penalty instead of carrying insurance would that cause a single payer system by default 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Medicare is running deficits that are growing larger and larger every year  Medicare also has a lower administrative overhead than any private insurance company and spends a much higher percentage of it s funds on healthcare than any private insurance company The problem is out of control health care costs    gt The economic crisis is over Deficits are still huge and there is no plan to end that in sight  It s not The economy is getting better but it s not there yet And there are several plans that people are putting forward to reduce the deficit and debt The differences occur on what to cut   gt Dems are not a clear win on social issues either  Please elaborate I ve not yet heard a republican view on any social issue that is better than the Democractic view on the same issue 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I use the word  force because that s how taxes are collected to pay for these things   No you use the word force because you were fed a narrative that makes you feel good Why don t you pay for the things you use and everyone does the same and you ll come out in the same place It s called society Once again you show that you want something for nothing     gt They will have to live with the consequences It s what freedom and liberty is all about   No they won t They will be begging HUMANE people to treat them anyway And you advocate these service providers to let them die You will be destroying those around  That is reality Sorry you are too immature to live in it      
PoliticalDiscussion,What  is a  national discussion about race    million people in a room together  Or do we appoint representatives to speak for certain groups who does the appointing how many are there and what is the forum  I don t think it s possible just because of the logistics of it  A  national discussion is not a thing We have politicians who grandstand and talking heads who bloviate for ratings and people who pound out incoherent drivel in Yahoo comments and this thread and     No it is not possible to have a national discussion because there are too many of us  We have discussions with our friends and family and coworkers and the people who live inside our computers in small social groups and broad social change occurs gradually 
PoliticalDiscussion,Perhaps if the court strikes down the mandate and alternative to force people to buy health insurance would be that in order to be eligible for medicare later in life you have to buy insurance young 
PoliticalDiscussion,The law in question  Affordable Care Act does not require you to buy Medicare and only certain types of income are subject to Medicare taxes so not all people pay in  My question is what the Affordable Care Act required you to buy Medicare Does that avoid the  commercial product stumbling block 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hear you and that is a perfectly acceptable answer I myself have started to get kind of irritated by it now At first it was okay but now it seems to be more pandering for attention Kind of like  look at me    I m doing something 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know what s constitutional or not but regulating hospitals seems a lot more reasonable to me than forcing people to buy things No one s forcing anyone to open a hospital or to keep their hospital open so if it was really that onerous to provide free emergency services you could always close your hospital down  People being forced to buy medical insurance don t really have the option to stop  being people  And being a person seems to be all you have to do to be required to buy insurance  At least that s the difference in my mind 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eh as long as it remains a relevant issue I don t see what s wrong with politicians choosing to make a visible statement about anything they feel strongly about  Now as for how many of them might be doing it purely to pander or for votes I won t argue that probably isn t the case for some of them But I don t think there s anything wrong with it in theory There are plenty of people across the country who have a strong interest in seeing the Trayvon Martin situation handled a particular way and there s nothing wrong with wanting their elected officials to give voice to those concerns as well  After it s settled it ll be a different issue 
PoliticalDiscussion,That was REAGAN that passed that one LOL
PoliticalDiscussion,The way Idealist in me sees a system where people can focus solely on the education of their students and not have to worry about the security of their job    that being said the realist absolutely understands and has seen how this system can be taken advantage of 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was the nearest one following the ruling in Citizens United because several days  or weeks  before Obama chastised the Judges in a speech for their decision and the  members of the typically right leaning side that voted in favor didn t attend the speech  But you bring up a really good point   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Not all US Citizens live in the USA  there are several hundred thousand who impossibly or not are not in this market   Grasping at straws here     gt Aside from that   does it really make sense to give the federal government the power to control what you purchase and when   When the government is us yes Obama is at heart a community activist I believe in him over Bain Capital s finest 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a conclusion that can be rationally reached but one thing that you must remember is that the constitution was that the framers wanted the legislative branch to have the most amount of power as it would be the branch that the majority of them would likely be in To think that they knew over a decade later the vague definition of what the Supreme Court would do would allow Marshall to rule that the court has this power is arguable 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It s not in the interest of everyone It s in the interest of the portion of the population that would be net beneficiaries  I couldn t disagree more I have a very real interest in the well being of my fellow humans and not just because I care about them but also because a healthy educated and secure society is a happy one and a happy one is productive and peaceful and those are benefits which everyone shares in Even for the minority of people who pay more money into the system than they get out of it they still benefit for these reasons In the US  and in many places in Europe too but on a smaller scale what you increasingly have is a diminishing number of progressively richer people in an increasingly poor country It isn t good for the rich or the poor to live in a place like that   gt False Who do you think runs your healthcare system  It runs itself I m not being facetious it is run by doctors and administrators just like in a private system All the government does is foot the bill and manage the highest levels like determining which regions need new hospitals and so on    gt Our universal health care for the elderly  Medicare is far from cheap Profit isn t a major cost driver in the US healthcare sector  This is for well documented reasons including most obviously that older people cost more but also the drug companies have a large say in dictating the price of drugs which drives up their cost something which isn t such an issue elsewhere US hospitals also are well known to order larger numbers of expensive tests While this is good for the individuals who can afford them it is unrealistic in a universal system with finite resources which must put them to the best overall use  Other reasons for increased cost are advertising costs and marketing strategies and the cost of running entire departments which exist to determine whether or not to pay for someone  this is the most objectionable aspect of private health insurance  Note that these departments are entirely absent in government programmes which somewhat counter intuitively means that state health care has fewer bureaucratic hurtles than private ones Another expense for the US government is that private companies reject very unhealthy people fobbing off the most expensive people to the state One of the most important aspects of  Obamacare is the regulation which makes this practice illegal   gt It depends on what your definition of fair is  Some people are born rich some poor some naturally healthy some sickly for life This is unfair and it is natural But for more than  years humans struggled to overcome nature To do what we can to minimise the differences in potential between the weak and the sick and the rich and the healthy  why should children suffer because of something they cannot help when the means to ameliorate the worst if it exist  we have created a system which attempts to make it so that a sick poor person will get the same care and education as a rich one I can t think of any way it is unfair The rich are rich because society has fostered an environment in which they can become rich and in return they need to foster an environment in which people don t die ignorant and from treatable illness just because they earn less  Let me as you this Is it easier to become rich in a nation where everyone is healthy and educated or in one where the poor  and increasingly the middle class go heavily into debt to pay their education and medical bills and millions go without    gt I don t know what your boom generation did but the average baby boomer in the US gets more from Medicare and Social Security than they paid in which is one of the main reasons the programs are hemorrhaging money Many of them also didn t pay much higher taxes than we do now during their working life and paid historically low taxes during their highest earning years  Actually the boom generation in my nation emigrated to your nation If there are problems paying for Medicare and SS today I d look at possible problems with the tax regime since the  s and see if it could be fixed by returning to pre  s rates It is a myth that such systems are doomed and inefficient rather they are robust so long as they aren t strangled by spending cuts 
PoliticalDiscussion, Whooosh 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the constitution is supreme over ordinary law and the courts have jurisdiction over disputes of law then they must be able to say if a law conflicts with the constitution  It s implicit 
PoliticalDiscussion,the Ryan budget doesn t kill medicare  Medicare is already dead the Ryan budget just admits it 
PoliticalDiscussion,republicans in Congress have nothing to do with single payer being a dead issue the it would be overwhelmingly rejected by the democratic caucus on its own 
PoliticalDiscussion,   Good one  D
PoliticalDiscussion,Just quickly read Article  it says nothing about the Supreme Court having the power nor responsibility to deem laws unconstitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not unless they re willing to wear  suits   showing what they really care about 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think he can run on that and probably will if the mandate is struck down but I m not optimistic about the possibility of passing single payer as long as the Republicans control the House 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Are you a fan of monopolies in general Because of the steep discounts  This is also a strawman argument Please do not put words in my mouth I am simply pointing out that jkvandelay s argument that corporate insurance is better than national insurance simply because corporations get discounts is a flawed argument because nations could get just as good if not better discounts  Although I prefer state or national health insurance as an option my preference is primarily because this is the only realistic way to get affordable coverage for people who are out of work or self employed not because of any possibility for greater discounts due to the larger group size 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Plain and simple Provide that same tax break to individuals  That would be my preferred solution   gt The only reason we have employer funded health insurance is because that s the way we ve always done it  Well also the tax incentives and there was a period where insurance was offered because of wage controls 
PoliticalDiscussion,The mandate is the issue at the heart of this week s Constitutional challenge to the law For this week at least it s all that is important 
PoliticalDiscussion,For the purposes of constitutionality   the healthcare mandate question focuses on whether the federal government can force citizens to purchase something  engage in commerce   Hospitals are already engaged in interstate commerce  providing medical services and therefore A can be regulated B by corollary forced to provide medical services  The key thing to note here is that if the mandate is constitutional this federal power does not only apply to health insurance it applies to everything and is a recipe for the federal government to strip away individual freedom under the rubric of your inaction  failure to exercise failure to buy a car constitutes participation in a market 
PoliticalDiscussion,The constitution grants all judicial power to the court  Judicial review is unquestionably part of that power 
PoliticalDiscussion,A quick note about tenure  From what I ve been told tenure originated as a protection against being fired for not producing  good results in research or for producing unpopular opinions in academia  It was not intended to guarantee a job  I can t really see how tenure fits into the system of K education  well I do see  how it fits but I mean I don t see how it  should fit in the K model  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the opposition defines the debate    And none of the rest of it is affordable doable without the mandate And without the mandate one of the biggest financial problems does not get solved paying for treatment for the voluntarily uninsured  those people who want rights without responsibility  
PoliticalDiscussion, The chance of living in a modern society and not being in this market at some point in a life is so unlikely as to be impossible   Not all US Citizens live in the USA  there are several hundred thousand who impossibly are not in this market Aside from that   does it really make sense to give the federal government the power to control what you purchase and when  
PoliticalDiscussion,If I m talking to someone playing stupid I guess I am I m willing to listen if you are willing to play serious discussion Can you not find significant differences between the two 
PoliticalDiscussion,The difference is that the government isn t forcing the hospitals to buy anything Commerce is a central part of our capitalist society 
PoliticalDiscussion,Tax breaks can be changed There are a dozen ways to even that out  Plain and simple Provide that same tax break to individuals   The only reason we have employer funded health insurance is because that s the way we ve always done it It provides no natural advantage 
PoliticalDiscussion,I did not know this Thank you
PoliticalDiscussion,Single Payer is all but impossible now that the health care debate has been framed in terms people s freedom Look at how much flak the President took for the mandate Him going for a true single payer system would have Republicans screaming about a government takeover of health insurance and this time they would be right So the dream is dead there will be no comprehensive health care reform  However Obama could do very well by running on a platform about reforming medicare and medicaid He could very easily run on reforming medicare part D to allow the government to negotiate prescription drug costs He could also push standalone bills consisting of some of the more popular aspects of the ACA such as extending the amount of time kids can stay on their parents plan and preventing insurance companies of denying insurance based on preexisting conditions   That type of strategy would juxtapose quite nicely with the narrative that the Republicans have put out with Paul Ryan s budget proposal  that basically kills medicare  
PoliticalDiscussion,I might buy that for drugs but the black homicide rate is still at least x the white  And since it s  black on black racism doesn t really enter in to that picture 
PoliticalDiscussion,the argument will likely center around the federal governments mandate The states can require hospitals to provide care if they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sadly it would be a political miscalculation and would probably cost him the election  Republicans would say that he tried to expand Federal power with a plan that was found to be unconstitutional then doubled down and went for full on Socialism  Obama would be better off identifying the SCOTUS with the Right and pointing out that the individual mandate was their idea in the first place  Romney has some pretty clear weaknesses on this issue   the President should put the ball in his court 
PoliticalDiscussion,But the point is they can offer more value in healthcare than in cash because of that tax break 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know the common political thought is to look at the mandate as a compromise between  do nothing and  Single Payer  but I don t think it should be looked at in that way for several reasons   For one you still have to pay for insurance and that s going to get more and more expensive It would be a fairly easy political argument to make that Insurance companies can t keep a control on prices but a large medicare program can because of better negotiating prices 
PoliticalDiscussion,In other words there are much larger forces at play and the massive problem of unemployment in the US is not caused by unions If you ask any company what makes them decide to locate in a specific location they will give you a whole list of different factors Union density is just one and it certainly isn t the most important  Every country has to make it s own determination of how they want their workforce to function Theoretically minimum wage also increases unemployment yet we have decided as a society that it s still a beneficial policy Clearly we have decided some policies are acceptable even if they raise unemployment because there are other metrics that matter                                                                  Germany on the other hand has no minimum wage They have a very high rate of unionization and a very low unemployment rate Their workforce recently shifted Companies promised to keep people employed  not outsource labor to other countries and provide training Unions agreed to a longer work week lower wages and reduced benefits All of which was decided by the private sector   source     Their system also relies on massive government subsidies to give people rent assistance and help with other living expenses The wages of their low skilled workers has been falling even as the German economy remains relatively strong   source     tldr Labor unions are a perfectly legitimate part of any country s workforce  If you want to see an actual labor cartel in action look at guilds   
PoliticalDiscussion,No chance of working at a federal level the mandate was unpopular enough with swing voters Much like gay marriage the best hope for a single payer system is on a state by state level   Vermont has passed a law for a single payer system but it s more a general framework with a lot of the details  costs etc still to be resolved I also read that a Massachusetts state representative is pondering submitting a similar bill   If it can be proven to work in these few trials runs you ll see other states in New England and possibly the west coast take a run at it 
PoliticalDiscussion,A democratic republic Convince enough people you are right then all of you vote for representatives that will represent you 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s basically an argument that healthcare should be done at the state level then In fact it s an argument for doing healthcare at a level even lower than the states considering California itself is bigger than Canada 
PoliticalDiscussion,We re having the conversation now and we ve been having it since long before   The good guys are winning but it s taking a while 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Obviously I and any libertarian would save him  Why     gt Then our hands are tied we can not let ourselves lose the principles of having freedom and liberty for all just because it suits our needs this instance   So material wealth trumps humanity  What a foul freedom that is  
PoliticalDiscussion,We give them food stamps and more  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No you have no understanding of the concept that the Supreme Court put forward in Citizens United  Oh really  Please explain where I am off base 
PoliticalDiscussion, will be treated as a Grinch out to crush children let rapists own the streets and burn your homes down Yea public unions are good at that  There isn t a whole lot of debate tolerance before it becomes a death struggle  Regarding Wisconsin I think that what got so many people up in arms was the way that Governor Walker went about attempting to combat union power  Compare this to Connecticut and their governor who worked with the unions for some significant fiscal gains  He brought an offer and the unions that accepted it were spared layoffs the ones that didn t  prison guards state police were going to be cut down  They changed their tune when they saw that he was going to go through with it and so few jobs were actually lost but there were no huge protests as there were in Wisconsin no recalls taking time money and resources from the state  Don t get me wrong there is still a long way to go before CT is in financial balance but I think it was a step in the correct direction  
PoliticalDiscussion,Debt  broke 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is correct  However the standard for an affirmative defense is typically lower than  beyond a reasonable doubt   That is the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt but the defense needs only show a  preponderance of the evidence   in favor of an affirmative defense  Basically Zimmermann just needs to show that it is more likely than not that he acted in self defense 
PoliticalDiscussion, lt shrug gt   I would think the  cost of providing your benefits should include tax breaks already subtracted It sounds like you re mincing words  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you might be on to something with your food for thought I think the differences between Americans are often much larger than the differences between Europeans within their own nations It can t explain it all but is isn t negligible I think   gt I disagree that public health care would decrease bureaucracy but I do agree that the fact that American companies have to provide health care to their works puts them at a disadvantage against firms in other countries that don t have to worry about that cost  I m not so sure about that foreign firms in the US need to provide coverage for their US employees and US firms in Europe don t so it balances out I could be wrong though 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Founders definitely intended for the Supreme Court to have the power of judicial review as is made explicit in Federalist No   As to whether or not the Court has overstepped its authority and become a partisan body well I m not entirely sold on that argument It s all over in the media right now but I think a lot of people are just looking at this from a political perspective instead of a legal perspective   The legal reality is that the Court has expanded Congress s Commerce Clause power for the past  years The legal academy had long since concluded that Congress s power over commerce was essentially unlimited and pointed towards Raich as an example of that they dismissed Lopez because Congress got into the habit of playing a game to write the legislation so it didn t interfere with  purely local matters and instead was predicated on something else but carried the same effect  But conservative legal theorists of course don t believe that Congress s power is unlimited especially with regards to noncommercial activity and especially inactivity Such views have been simmering for a while  Thomas dissented in Raich for example and know they ve come to a boil because the case before the Court is so deeply involved in Commerce Clause powers Many conservative and libertarian theorists believe that an upholding of the mandate would imply that Congress s power would have no logical limitations whatsoever Scalia and Alito raised much the same point in his questions during this week s argument For these theorists the mandate presents an opportunity to reverse a nearly century long trend and make right some ancient wrongs in the conception of Congress s authority dating back to the New Deal  So even if some of this has to do with politics there s a lot more going on behind the scenes Sometimes facile explanations involving Yankees fans and umpires aren t very accurate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Explain Marbury v Madison then
PoliticalDiscussion,This is not true   In a criminal court a argument of Self defense  which Zimmerman would be making if it goes to trial requires what is called an    Affirmative defense   Zimmerman is essentially pleading guilty to the charges but saying he has a reason he shouldn t be criminally liable He then has to prove his reason The burden of proof in an  affirmative defense   is on the defendant   Zimmerman would have to prove that  when he pulled the trigger  a reasonable person in his exact position would have thought his life was in danger If he can t prove that he s already admitted to killing a man and he ll be guilty 
PoliticalDiscussion, Zimmerman  suffered a broken nose a gash to his head and other injuries according to Sanford police reports He traveled to the police station that night to give his account of events and then went home Sanford police confirm that  he did not warrant medical attention at the scene   and did not seek medical attention until the next day       The young girl who was speaking to Trayvon on the cellphone was on the phone the entire time and heard Zimmerman approach him  said Benjamin Crump a lawyer for the Martin family  Trayvon turned around asked him why he was following him and Zimmerman asked Trayvon what he was doing there That does not sound like Travyon approached him first or attacked him   
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope stock price is way up   But thanks for realizing that the situation is a bit more complex than the tired  union bad meme Without a union employees are at the mercy of the corporations 
PoliticalDiscussion,In all seriousness the difference between being forced to purchase private insurance and being forced to pay taxes should be pretty clear   Think of it this way   The federal government can only do things   specifically stated  in the constitution That means every time the Congress passes a law there has to be a  specific part of the constitution they can point to to say  This right here this allows us to do this    Why does this matter The constitution specifically states that the government is allowed to tax it s citizens This means that when Congress takes a portion of your paycheck they can point to the Constitution and say  Article so and so part so and so gives us this right  The constitution   also allows  the government to pay for health care for it s citizens which is why it s legal for Medicare to pay for old people s medical bills   Now that we know why medicare is legal why are people saying the mandate is unconstitutional   Many people  and it looks like at least  maybe as many as  or  supreme court justices argue that there is nothing in the constituition   which specifically allows the federal government to compel it s citizens to buy a  private product that they aren t in the market for     Other people argue that since everyone  as a condition of being a human will one day be sick and need health care they are born into the health care market so the constitution does give the government the right to do so  under the  Interstate Commerce clause   The individual mandate and medicare arewo totally different constitutional arguments the two aren t really related on a constitutional level In fact if you go to  supremecourt org   and listen to the six hours of oral arguments medicare and social security are only even discussed for about  minutes of it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes the problem is out of control health care costs and medicare does little to control them  The US economy has been out of recession for a couple years now  Your opinion of a stance on a social issue is just that  There s no objective better or worse 
PoliticalDiscussion,The court issues opinions along with their vote  These opinions represent their interpretation of the Constitution in terms of the case at hand  Since the US is a common law nation the interpretations from prior cases become precedent to decide future cases  So they don t just say  yes or no  they explain  why they said yes or no  And their explanation is just as influential to future case law as their vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,If people had such a serious issue with these things then they would vote in people who seek to get rid of them  Because the majority does not vote it can be concluded that they do not care on way or the other  I fully support public access to roads and a free fire department  I have no problem paying taxes in order to have these things and the majority of people living in this country agrees with me 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I don t need to re read it   If you are carrying you ought not create scenarios on purpose where confrontation is likely That means you don t go following someone around that looks suspicious Call the police and disengage You are carrying for self defense   and that self defense does not include when you are getting your ass kicked for stalking
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t matter WHAT you are trying to do When you are out of money you are out of money I don t know why people don t get this 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly it s a tax used to pay for this government program What part of the constitution does it violate  It certainly doesn t have anything to do with the Interstate Commerce Clause 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You can hardly blame unions for creating unemployment   In other words you re a denier of the law of demand 
PoliticalDiscussion,The medicare tax is a separate tax just for health insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,They are compelling you to pay your taxes and then they decide to use that tax money for wars Medicare and other government programs You aren t buying anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you always a total dick 
PoliticalDiscussion,They re compelling me to buy health care for older people and I don t have a problem with that I personally want everyone who doesn t have health insurance to be able to buy into Medicare now instead of having to wait until they re  
PoliticalDiscussion,Interesting video but it isn t relevant to the specific legal question being discussed in this thread 
PoliticalDiscussion,So what you re saying is that if you google something you can find what you re looking for  NO WAY   Oh and sorry if I don t give a crap what an Austrian School of Economics professor thinks when facts back up Krugman It is a  fact that deregulation caused the fall off the cliff on Iceland It s also a fact that liberal economic policies work in Switzerland Sweden The U K  Germany France and the rest of the nations that use them have been incredibly stable I would be willing to consider the horrendous blog you linked if it didn t act like Krugman bases what he says off of nothing It s not as though he went to Iceland and said  They deregulated so it s deregulation s fault   A history of regulation has kept economies stable and time and time again deregulation has led to disaster It is the common factor in most crashes of industries 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Others have enough money and are healthy enough that they choose to pay for costs with cash rather than go through insurance which may or may not cover procedures you want Both are very much real and not impossible at all  I think you are taking an overly narrow view of the  market that is involved here  Yes there are people who are outside the health  insurance market  No there are not people who are outside the health  care market  Health extends well beyond doctors hospitals and insurance adjusters 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the legal distinction between auto insurance and health insurance is you have a choice to drive or not but you don t have a choice to live or not  As with most optional activities the government is free to regulate them   requiring auto insurance doesn t seem substantially different than requiring seat belts or that you drive on your side of the road 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree that public health care would decrease bureaucracy but I do agree that the fact that American companies have to provide health care to their works puts them at a disadvantage against firms in other countries that don t have to worry about that cost  A little food for thought here  I think one of the reasons why most Americans are uncomfortable with the kind of collectivism you describe here is because there isn t a singular homogeneous American culture or race that make up a majority of the population  It s just my opinion here but I think the fact that Sweeden is popluated by  gt  Swedes has a lot to do their ability to form a society like the one you describe  It may be more efficient that way but I think because that the US is made up of a mix of British German Irish Black and Hispanic ancestery with no group holding a majority means this type of society is less likely 
PoliticalDiscussion,Positive actions by the federal government   File income taxes   Register for the draft  Just the first ones that came to mind  I m sure there are others 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Supporting Pro Union Policies I m specifically referring to policies like Last In First Out  in education  which penalize qualified employees simply because they are on the lowest rung of the professional org chart Also granting tenure to undeserving employees in any profession prevents new blood from entering an office place I m intrigued by unions and believe  but have not seen any data that they are generational and not necessarily as popular or perceived as necessary among younger Americans as they are among workers from another generation       
PoliticalDiscussion,Race is at play at every level of the criminal justice system To say it isn t is to be ignorant of peer reviewed studies Bryan Stevenson was citing the work of David Baldus who found in a study that controlled for all other variables that if you were black and your alleged victim was white you were much much more likely to be sentenced to death 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the judiciary votes to interpret the Constitution in a different fashion than you then your interpretation will become invalid  Does that mean you are wrong Philosophically speaking not necessarily Legally Yes  That is how judicial review works 
PoliticalDiscussion,The incarceration rate has spiraled out of control largely because of harsh drug laws African Americans commit drug crimes at the same rate as  whites but are much more likely to get arrested for them Please educate yourself   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Republicans had more to gain from the bailouts  I m not exactly sure what you mean here but if it s that Repubs are significantly more beholden to corporate and specifically financial sector money than I think that s pretty naive   The Dems actually received a slight majority of financial sector money in the  election cycle  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It states they can regulate commerce  The Supreme Court has albeit slowly broadened the interpretation of the  Commerce Clause  Over the past dozen or so years I believe the standard has been that Congress can regulate  activities that substantially affect interstate commerce  but the decision in  Gonzales v Raich kind of reversed the course the Court was taking with  Lopez and  Morrison   The executive s argument is going to be that because a person s lack of health coverage may cause them to get sick lose their job and thus come to rely on federal aid programs and each of these actions has an effect on interstate commerce Congress is able to mandate that everyone has health coverage Under a previous Court you are probably correct in assuming they will definitely not let this pass keep in mind however the justices that dissented in  Gonzales v Raich are now gone  Rehnquist and O Connor and two Obama appointed justices took their places along with the wild card of Kennedy  It is  entirely possible and I frankly speaking will not be surprised in the least if the Court comes back upholding the individual mandate I think looking at our judicial system and analyzing it using a rationale of  The Constitution says this the Constitution says that  is objectively opposite of the reality that has been constitutional evolution in our country since judicial review was established in  
PoliticalDiscussion,Everybody who disagrees with you is wrong Who the fuck are you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt For the last fucking time Social Security is solvent for the next  or so years  Uh if you have evidence of that you might want to report it to the SS Trustees because their latest report shows that it is in the red right now and there is no projection for it to ever be in the black again   So yeah please let them know  Or maybe you could believe them and the CBO 
PoliticalDiscussion,So if a bunch of people who vote politically instead of based on the Constitution that means I am wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,uhh   yeah  Good talk 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wisconsinite here  If you judge the Budget Repair Bill purely by how much money it s saved for the state municipalities than it s been a huge success  However I m concerned about the effect this is having on the quality of public education in the state  The removal of the unions ability to negotiate over workplace rules in each school districts teachers handbooks strikes me as less about saving money and more about sticking it to teachers  Not to mention that a lot of experienced teachers are retiring out of fear of losing retirement benefits and being replaced by cheap young teachers  Not that I believe an older teacher is necessarily a better teacher but on average that experience is probably valuable  Also while merit pay seems like a good idea on the surface in practice this just means tying salaries to standardized test results and I think this is one of the worst possible ways to decide which are the best teachers  All in all it s created and atmosphere that s very bitter and divisive and where one side wants to take everything back the way it was and the other side wants to demonize educators as freeloading off the taxpayers  It saddens me that more than a year after this mess started we still haven t had a mature dialogue about the actual issues in the state 
PoliticalDiscussion,True as well  I don t think it s fair that in order to be a plumber then you must be in a union 
PoliticalDiscussion,The witness made a  call that was recorded tlaked to the police and gave more or less the same story as Zimmerman only using shirt color and not knowing either of the men Just because we have only found out about this in the last few days doesn t mmean the police haven t already looked into it Zimmerman received first aid at the police station and went to the hospital the next day 
PoliticalDiscussion,Considering that judicial review is not in the constitution yes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Looks like they can be fined Not sure how often it actually happens It s interesting that even the individual physician can be personally fined and even barred from future Medicare funding    The CMS and the Office of the Inspector General  OIG enforce EMTALA The OIG can fine Hospitals   per violation    for hospitals with less than  beds and possibly terminate their Medicare provider agreement Individual physicians also may receive a fine up to   and be excluded from future Medicare funding  
PoliticalDiscussion,LOL read a little bit about the actual law and not some bloggers thoughts on it 
PoliticalDiscussion,No as the OP states when people looked out there window they saw someone  Martin on top of another man  Zimmerman bashing his head into the ground I don t know what happened but I do know that Martin was not the innocent little kid he was portrayed to be If he was being followed why didn t he call the cops himself or go to his home less than  yards away 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Having the government as the master doesn t make it better   You are living in a democracy Whining does not make laws action does 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well we ll find out in a couple of months when a bunch of partisan old mostly men will decide your interpretation is wrong      
PoliticalDiscussion,It states they can regulate commerce It does not say force people into commerce Might I suggest  doses of Constitution daily 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama is doing the same thing so I don t really see the issue Obama increased the debt more in  years then Bush did in  
PoliticalDiscussion,It is not really the party There are some good people on both sides its the majority of the party that are bad though 
PoliticalDiscussion,How can you characterize paying for what you will use so our economy won t collapse as slavery   Grow up 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt they d be solvent for longer  But not indefinitely 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No of course not  Then why are you saying we should force everyone to get health insurance   gt Why would everyone want food insurance  The point is not that anyone would but to point out that the same price skyrocketing that we see in healthcare would happen in food My point is that the price of healthcare is skyrocketing BECAUSE of insurance so pushing more people into it and covering more things with it is what is causing prices to skyrocket 
PoliticalDiscussion,The comment I was replying to  emphasis mine   gt   Hospitals and Medical Professionals  have a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really  Who do you think knows best 
PoliticalDiscussion,Indeed But it has a higher unionization rate than average 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats why im a libertarian 
PoliticalDiscussion,Negotiations require a set of rules and a judge  Who sets the rules  Who appoints the judge 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Do we force everyone to go on a food stamp program  No of course not   gt do we give the poorest of the poor who truly can t afford food what they need  We try our best   gt If everyone had food insurance the cost of food would skyrocket  Why would everyone want food insurance      
PoliticalDiscussion,The word  corporation is not mentioned in the decision  Instead it speaks about  voices other nonsense  The ruling refers to an entity not a group of individuals  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You can make choices to not purchase gas You cannot make choices to not visit a doctor  You can make choices not to do either Both choices will result in bad things happening   gt Why would the high deductible be any different from today s insurance plans that drop you once you become to expensive then bury you in court till you die  Yes that does happen sometimes but in a world where people can actually chose which insurance plan to go with all it would take is one instance of an insurance company doing this and they would lose their customers in an instant Remember right now because HC is so expensive  due to it covering everything under the sun  your only option is to get it through your employer and you have no choice what company that employer goes with  Imagine if a car insurance company decided  yeah we are not going to replace that totaled car we are just going to cancel your insurance  it would be an outrage news companies would pick up on it and people would leave that insurance company in droves That is why you don t see it in industries where people actually have a choice 
PoliticalDiscussion,The hospitals buy a hell of a lot of stuff to treat patients they are forced to treat Doctors and nurse s time for instance and needles and blood and all sorts of stuff 
PoliticalDiscussion,    Greece Spain Portugal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt regulating hospitals seems a lot more reasonable to me than forcing people to buy things  Forcing a hospital to treat people who can t pay  IS forcing them to buy things All that equipment all those doctors and nurses bandages needles  that stuff costs  money 
PoliticalDiscussion,The individual mandate is a  crucial part of health reform Without it state exchanges would be unsustainable as only the sicker people will choose buy in The whole idea of insurance is risk pooling and if healthier members of the population are left out premiums will rise like crazy over time   You re suggesting that given the option very few people will remain uninsured but this is just an assumption Even if we assume all those individuals through  years old are covered  and remember a  year old still needs to have a parent  with health insurance  what about the typically healthy  year olds At this age there s still little incentive to seek health insurance   I have a feeling a very substantial portion of the U S population would forgo getting health insurance without the mandate And  a year is a significant amount of money for someone who makes around k a year 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Since the corporations are people   right there The SC ruled that people do not lose their free speech when they group together as a corporation not that corporations are people 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I would argue no because Hospitals and Medical Professionals have a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability   Huh  So because you think they have an engrained belief to treat everybody they can be forced to do so How about vets can we now force vets to treat and save the lives of any injured animals regardless of how that is going to get paid for Vets have the same duty to treat the sick as doctors do 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt We give them food stamps and more  Do we force everyone to go on a food stamp program Or do we give the poorest of the poor who truly can t afford food what they need  If everyone had food insurance the cost of food would skyrocket because there would be no incentive to look for the best value in food people would buy whatever they want and stores would not post prices  just like is happening in Healthcare 
PoliticalDiscussion,Chrysler in   
PoliticalDiscussion,Erm  Correction We havent as taxpayers made a profit on the auto compabies Yet The us govt owns about  of GM The stock price is about  a share and to break even they would need to sell it at  a share True GM itself is making money But that doesnt mean the taxpayers will get their money back We should hold the auto companies an the banks responsible like what we did with 
PoliticalDiscussion,Clearly the mandate could thus take the form of a tax rebate   That is to say you get a tax credit if you buy insurance and you do not if you don t buy insurance and simply raise taxes to make it an effective tax hike on all people who do not buy insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m from the RIAA we already have the rights to this sitcom do not pirate our intellectual property 
PoliticalDiscussion,There would always be one troll that voted though   
PoliticalDiscussion,But that s not how it works Federally funded hospitals have an obligation to treat anyone that comes through their doors if they are in need of critical medical care You can charge a  year old waiter   in medical bills but there is no way you re going to see that money The cost of care still has to be paid and so it has an adverse effect on insurance premiums and taxpayers The only way that doesn t happen is if you let an uninsured person die in the parking lot if they have a serious illness or accident I hardly think that s the way to go  Look at the pharmaceutical companies and say the free market does a good job of keeping medical costs down Insurance companies will strive to make a profit and the best way to do that is to take in more money  premiums than they dole out  medical coverage  It s in their best interest to charge as much as possible and pay as little as possible 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt and pointing out that the individual mandate was their idea in the first place  While this is completely true I think there is a reason that this statement has not been more prevalent in the healthcare argument You see no matter how much we see the political parties as a single entity they are in fact just individuals united around a common core of beliefs To make this point work you would have to be able to target an individual who could answer this question on behalf of the Republican Party That person would have to have been a Republican in the  s who openly supported the single payer system he would have to still be in politics still be a republican and be level headed and consistent enough to have creditability  that excludes Newt as no one takes him seriously anymore  If you could find that person you could directly ask  what has changed since then that you use to believe single payer was the right solution for the country and why do you now think it is a bad idea  If you ask any other Republican that doesn t meet those criteria they can just say  the party may have had those ideas but I don t  
PoliticalDiscussion,Negotiation  Are you claiming that someone does know best 
PoliticalDiscussion,Government doesn t give a shit how many people vote 
PoliticalDiscussion,If no one knows best then how are differences settled  How is harm defined  If we all work in a vacuum where only our own personal paradigms are paramount what happens when they collide  Who wins 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Who knows best  No one  People can try to determine what is best for themselves and act accordingly   gt Everything we do affects someone else eventually   That s not what you said  You said you can t co exist without harming each other 
PoliticalDiscussion,And now your stupidity comes shining through    You think people are effectively unable to care for themselves yet once  of those same people vote for something it s legitimate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes  There is no  right to medicine  
PoliticalDiscussion,A  profit margin is not obscene for any meaningful sense of the word  Insurance is a scheme where people pool assets to limit exposure to unlikely events  It s really sad that I have to explain this to someone that has made many many comments in a discussion about insurance but here we are 
PoliticalDiscussion,If no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes  less than  then the House takes a vote and decides who is president out of the three candidates with the most electoral college votes  So in your proposal if literally no one voted except the candidates  and I m sure the members of their immediate family who are old enough there would only be a few states who would cast their electoral votes and no one would get enough votes to win outright The house  which is currently majority Republican would then elect the President who would be Romney Here s where it gets good Then the Senate  which is currently majority Democrat would elect the VP and they can elect anyone they want So with this situation playing out you could theoretically have a Romney president with Obama as his VP    and then we write our sitcom 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you re going to use the term exploitation as Marx defined it you d better state that upfront because otherwise people aren t going to accept your claim  and for good reason  
PoliticalDiscussion,   and very wasteful  I wish they would fire more incompetents   but they can t 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They assume people are altruistic and will help those in need without being forced to by people that supposedly know best  Who knows best   gt So two people can t co exist without harming each other You must have some wife  Everything we do affects someone else eventually  
PoliticalDiscussion,And then Nixon went to China and we found an able and cheap workforce who can do the same work Americans do for a cost of pennies on the dollar 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would say more to do with the de emphasis of manufacturing in this nation    We re switching to a service based economy now 
PoliticalDiscussion,The unions should justify themselves to their own members   workers should have a right to decide if they want to be part of a union in working for their profession or not  
PoliticalDiscussion,So if  of the voting public decides that they want something it s automatically legitimate for them to vote it for themselves  
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s not impossible  I know people without insurance and a DNR  I know people that are so wealthy they have decided to effectively self insure  I know people without insurance that live alone and basically outside of society so there is no way they could get to a hospital if they wanted to 
PoliticalDiscussion,You also need a license to drive a car  Does that mean the government can force you to get a license to breathe  There are many many laws  None of which force you to buy something or pay a fine  I hadn t seen that idiotic analogy in a long time  I thought it had been eradicated but I guess I was wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt But that runs counter to the libertarian position  No it doesn t  They assume people are altruistic and will help those in need without being forced to by people that supposedly know best   gt Impossible unless one is the only person in existence   So two people can t co exist without harming each other  You must have some wife 
PoliticalDiscussion,Wouldn t the electors in the electoral college still vote Or is part of your hypothetical situation that they wouldn t vote either 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because people are naturally altruistic and it s just a human thing to do  But that runs counter to the libertarian position   gt Freedom is the freedom to do what you want to your own life and to your own fruits of labor as long as it doesn t harm anyone else  Impossible unless one is the only person in existence  
PoliticalDiscussion,I think the answer is yes and no They are free to not treat people but the money that they get is from patient covered insurance through the government like medicare and medicaid I believe that is the money they are talking about So they will just not make payments on those things So we aren t specifically giving the hospitals money just to treat uninsured ER patients 
PoliticalDiscussion,I would not believe Obama if he tried that now  It would just be a cynical ploy to shore up the base 
PoliticalDiscussion,You know in Florida I am mandated to buy auto insurance in order to have a car I drive therefore I must be covered in case I get in an accident   I also have to by law always wear my seatbelt I can be pulled over and ticketed if a police officer sees me not wearing one   I would much rather be forced to buy health insurance in order to see our rates go down drastically than be forced by police dictatorship to wear a seatbelt if I don t want to 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well giving them money means they have to do what we want them to Hospitals are free NOT to treat other people but we are also free TO NOT give them money   Right 
PoliticalDiscussion, Bababouie 
PoliticalDiscussion,It reminds me of what they did with seat belts when they forced states to adopt seat belt laws and took away road and infrastructure money if they didn t Coercion is nothing new in the grand scheme of things but I m having doubts that it is going to stand I believe that congress has a the right to regulate any trade scheme however they wish and if there is only the political will then a mandate would become legal  Reason or facts don t matter right now people think its unconstitutional because of the way the healthcare act passed without the majority vote of congress because republicans were obstructing anything obama tried They still hate Obama s guts and this is partly why Heaven forbid anything that remotely smacks of socialism with poor people being payed for by tax payers even though it happens like that anyway right now Having it as law that forces me to sign up and pay for something for the good of everyone is not exactly  american  Nothing like a classic big government telling the small people what to do narrative to whip up a frenzy and holy shit if it involves their taxes or their money 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s also bringing a shitload of guns into the area from Russia and lied about being the  white commander of the SPLA The SPLA has actually threatened him with legal action because of the things he s said  The movie did bad because its poverty porn and Sam Childers was a violent junkie and now he s a violent preacher doing  God s Work  Go watch some of his YouTube videos they flash things like  mercenary and  one faith on the screen and reek of religious propaganda 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between  and  years after being founded  Yep all those storied medieval democracies that crumbled from greatness into dust after they enacted universal healthcare and welfare for the peasants We must learn from their mistakes   gt Language English only   gt Culture Constitution and the Bill of Rights   gt NO freebies to Non Citizens  The writer goes to great pains to point out how people are being unfairly accused of racism or prejudice and then throws these little tidbit in What s this irrelevant xenophobic perk doing in a manifesto that s supposedly all about the economic issues Couldn t resist the the urge to plug the  Murica theme I guess  Some right wingers think that because the majority of their politicians manage to meet the incredibly low bar of  not actually using ethnic slurs and hate speech in their public statements anymore that they can play the unfairly accused of racism card whenever they want But you know what People can read between the lines and we re perfectly aware that just because they know they can t run on the slogan  Let s go back to the days when white people had all the power and cultural influence and the others knew their place in society  doesn t mean that that message isn t clear to anyone with half a brain anyway  I disagree with a lot of conservative ideas about the economy and public policy but obviously this is a chain email written by someone whose political experience is limited to the thought they put into the signs they made for the Tea Party rallies they ve been to not an economist or a politician or anyone who s studied the nuances of the issues I don t think this represents the views of more intelligent conservative voices on the situation  I too read this with cynicism and some disapproval OP 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Others have enough money and are  healthy enough  Even young healthy fit people have catastrophic accidents  Then it s good bye assets and hello bankruptcy unless one happens to have hundreds of thousands of dollars socked away somewhere    Mary Brown a plaintiff in one of the original ACA lawsuits felt that way  Last month she went into bankruptcy   due to unpaid medical bills    
PoliticalDiscussion,A lot of people who didn t like ACA were unhappy because they wanted a public option instead  But I still think that it would be a mistake for Obama to run on it because it would be an impossibility with the congress we have now    ETA  it may be a net positive if enough people were already benefiting from the plan and losing those benefits causes a change in their insurance  I think Carville s right costs will skyrocket people with pre existing conditions will be screwed  and that  age will only go up as the baby boomers age and rescission will be back with a vengeance  
PoliticalDiscussion,That just doesn t make intuitive sense to me So if I don t want the feds to regulate my tomato stand I have to somehow ensure that every customer is from my own state What if I screw up and accidentally sell to someone who says he s from my state but he s really from a neighboring state Then suddenly I m in federal jurisdiction  That just seems like a power grab to me  shrug
PoliticalDiscussion,Personally I find Medicare for all to be much more constitutional than both the individual mandate and medicare in it s current form So in that s sense it s preferable but it s still not my ideal solution 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt you remove the bureaucracy   Are you insane  Governments are by wide margins the most bureaucratic institutions in the world   gt Knowing that you   will always be treated for free  can steal money from someone else to pay for what you want is a huge load off your back   FTFY  There is no such thing as a free lunch 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt bamacare package which actually reduces costs in the long run and reduces the deficit  Bullshit  Just because something gets a CBO score that reduces the deficit doesn t mean it will actually reduce the deficit  Half of the promised deficit in reduction has ALREADY been repealed and the only parts of the law that have gone into effect are already vastly  over budget    There is literally no chance Obamacare will reduce the deficit   gt Bush was handed a good economy and zero wars and then he handed Obama a crumbling economy and  wars  Bush inherited the end of the dotcom boom  And Bush didn t force Obama to more than double the size of the afgahn war to the point where we are now spending more every year than the entire cost from   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt You and I have a very different understanding of issues around unions and government spending Where you see them as costly I see them as investments that will bring greater dividends and benefit society   Based on what evidence  When I look at government spending money on alternative fuels I see corn ethanol  When i look at them spending money on defense i see planes that cost more than their weight in gold   There is not a single area of government that is not infamous for its inefficiency and corruption  What on earth makes you think that the people who work at the DMV are the ones best suited to spend out money   gt Left wing socialist policies are designed to benefit the majority  What policies are designed to do and what they actually do are not the same thing and it is dishonest in the extreme to pretend that they are 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have made a bit of a point of knowing something about this since it s a topic I argue about on the internet with some frequency More to the point the direct cost for a procedure is lower in Canada but so is the cost for the hospital the extra staff the equipment etc It s cheaper here 
PoliticalDiscussion,The problem is that once you end  forced unions you end all power for unions  if you can just hire non union workers without consequence that is who you will hire  Voluntary unions are toothless unions 
PoliticalDiscussion, Grasping at straws here   No I m speaking to my own personal experience You said that the chance of not being in the market is impossible I point as contrary example several hundred thousand americans and you completely gloss over it Are you willing to change your mind or is this a religious belief for you   When the government is us yes Obama is at heart a community activist I believe in him over Bain Capital s finest   What does Obama have to do with the inherent perogatives and exercise of federal power Is he president for life now 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama as a matter of fact is not suggesting increasing the national budget from  trillion to  trillion over  years And your phrasing is terrible I m sure you meant  The debt has increased under Obama more in  years than it did under Bush in   To which of course i would love a source Not to mention we re talking about long range deficit not the debt of a growing and inflating economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah but he was asking about positive action under the interstate commerce clause Filing income taxes is justifiably required via the necessary and proper clause as applied to the power to tax and spend for the general welfare  Registering for the draft is justifiably required via the necessary and proper clause as applied to power to declare war and provide for a military 
PoliticalDiscussion,Individual Mandate has no basis for being unconstitutional it has been on the books for over  years    See second militia act of  that forced every American male to purchase a firearm and ammunition   
PoliticalDiscussion,No  You re not the only one  The interstate commerce clause was much more narrowly construed prior to FDR  A four term president the Great Depression and a World War was enough to shift the Supreme Court to a broader definition and thereby allow for laws which had broad legal support but would otherwise be impermissible  e g  FLSA child labor restrictions Bacon Davis union prevailing wage requirements price controls on public transportation etc   
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t understand insurance do you Jeez      You don t understand much of anything you want  charities to be first responders 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly This is a hugely important Supreme Court case and the mandate is all that the media will focus on right now If the mandate fails the pre existing conditions benefit will be put in jeopardy because insurance companies can t cover people without additional healthy people in the risk pool 
PoliticalDiscussion,I want one of those free lunches 
PoliticalDiscussion,Like threatening to lock them up in jail take away their social security and employment opportunities if they fail to register for the draft 
PoliticalDiscussion, Every consistent form of government has some sort of benefit A strong absolute  benevolent that is dictatorship does wonders for imposing order out of chaos Think of what could be done in a short time given the absence of a bureaucracy for example  EDIT In case it wasn t clear I m agreeing here   
PoliticalDiscussion,I was going to respond to all three but I want to focus on just this one thing in the hope that you will read it and it will spark a dialogue   gt Increasing Debt Deficit Spending I agree that Republicans are just as guilty as Democrats in the spending department    You said it yourself They both spend a ton of money Bush passed the bank bailouts Obama passed the stimulus Bush waged wars with debt Obama expanded government health insurance  Before I continue let me tell you about my experience with the Democrats I care very much about education I think it is the biggest potential policy win out there in the Federal government We can fix more things to a greater degree by fixing education that through any other single act And Democrats are flat wrong about education What makes it worse is that they are wrong for cravenly political reasons They are perpetuating a wrecked educational system because the Teacher s Union tells them to I hate this I vote Democrat most of the time and I absolutely hate them on an almost personal level for the immorally unacceptably mind bogglingly awful policy morass that we call an education system This took me years to accept even after I really knew it to be true But eventually I did accept it and I think I am a better voter and citizen for that I told you that so that there was a chance you would believe me when I tell you this  You claim that Democrats want bigger government than Republicans But you know this is not true  you just said it was not true Then you repeated it anyway There is no convincing study  historical economic or statistical  that indicates that Republicans actually enact less spending than Democrats They just spend money on different things You might not like the things that Democrats fund and you are probably right to feel that way about a number of issues But the desired size of government is a poor way to distinguish elected Republicans from elected Democrats Let it sink in  the Republicans you vote for do not want a smaller government than the Democrats You may want that and  in their heart of hearts  elected Republicans may even want that But they do not make it happen They do not make  smaller government a legislative priority They are beholden to too many other interests to actually reduce the overall size of government just as Democrats are too beholden to the Teacher s Union to actually improve education The Republicans you vote for do not want a smaller government than the Democrats 
PoliticalDiscussion,Since you are dealing with corporations no more than requiring corporations to provide disability access or family leave 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I would argue no because Hospitals and Medical Professionals have a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability  What does that have to do with the Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correct Both engage in business with customers from another state  Now it the tomato stand guy was located in Georgia and only selling to customers from Georgia then it s different 
PoliticalDiscussion,So there s no difference between say Verizon which does business in all fifty states  clearly interstate commerce and my tomato stand if someone happens to cross state lines to buy some tomatoes 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I pretty much thought but your explanation makes it much more clear Thank you 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s called interstate commerce because it s commerce between the states If it were intrastate commerce it would only be business between customers businesses in a single state     
PoliticalDiscussion,This is about as cogent and articulate as most of the  I am the   posts from a few months back I m tempted to write more but I can t help but remember the old refrain  cast ye not thine pearls before swine for they shall turn upon ye and rend ye  
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope Since the question of Obamacare s mandate is whether it falls under the authority of the Commerce Clause a power given to only Congress it does not apply to Romneycare and in fact confirm that the states have the authority to mandate insurance but the federal government can not  In short Obamacare being unconstitutional would mean that the states are allowed to mandate insurance but the federal government can not  since all powers not given to Congress is given to the states  
PoliticalDiscussion,This is fucking stupid It only talks about the middle class vs the lower class The upper class and the true money powers of this country are completely missing from this discussion This whole argument just reinforces the idea of triangulation and keeping the people that need help too busy fighting with one another to realize where the problems need to be fixed Romney will only make this issue worse where as Obama is successfully leading the United States in a path where it will remain a major player  if not still the number one player in the world The problem is not that America is falling it s that the rest of the world is catching up Until we reset our  s logic that the United State s place in the world is to oversee every other country we only progress the real threat of collapsing just like all of the other empires that have roamed the earth prior With the advent of the internet and the ability to share information across country lines Obama s strategy is the correct path to be going down Remove yourself from the flawed simplistic ridiculous argument your friend sent in the email and instead take a step back and realize that there are  billion people on the earth not living in the United States Our  million have a chance to remain free and prosperous under the correct administration Romney and his team do not give a fuck about the average citizen At least with Obama our place in the world will not be tarnished 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s just commerce Or if it has to have a more special sounding name intrastate commerce 
PoliticalDiscussion,I first brought up  what  Where When 
PoliticalDiscussion,What would you like to call it then 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know what the law implies i like the idea of it but it is also flawed But a person who iniate s a conflict should not have the right to use this as a defense 
PoliticalDiscussion,I hate to break it to you but Obama will not be president forever Giving the government more power doesn t just mean giving the  current administration more power it means giving  every future administration that power too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Theft and enslavement are two different things I find it very difficult to take you seriously 
PoliticalDiscussion,Am I the only one who finds it absurd to call something  interstate commerce just because someone crossed state lines to get to your shop 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve heard them talking about them plenty Perhaps you just haven t been listening 
PoliticalDiscussion,You do realize there are non doctors who work at hospitals right And that sometimes they get to tell the doctors what to do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not trying to argue but I don t really see how job insecurity can should affect job performance for teaching  I understand how research or more elegantly synthesis of knowledge may yield results unwanted by people who hold the purse strings but simply educating doesn t have the same rules  Correct me if I am wrong  I would like to see the other side of this  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Auto Insurance  my state requires No Fault  Does your state also  require you to drive a car 
PoliticalDiscussion,How on earth is it as cut and dry as that You can t just say  it s cut and dry and poof it s a simple solution  If you want to take issue with his original post fine I can t vouch for him I can only call you out on a poor comparison between vets and doctors Your original argument isn t even relevant to the debate   gt Then he is not responding to the question The question is whether it is unconstitutional to require hospitals to provide care The doc s oath has nothing to do with it then Will you please please   please  pay attention  Hospitals   you mean those things filled with doctors If you make it so hospitals are not required to provide care to patients who can not pay let s see where that scenario takes us shall we   A hospital which can be run for a profit says no one who can t pay will be treated A sick person comes in and the doctors who work there are put in direct odds between their oath and hospital policy correct Either they treat the patient and go against hospital policy or deny treatment and violate their oath    gt Read the OP  I did Did you read my response or is questioning literacy your go to strategy now A hospital doesn t need to enact a policy that all of its members already hold on their own I m not exactly sure how to break it down more  That little bit at the end doesn t serve much purpose either by the way My sincere apologies for actually trying to get you to defend a position 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt what would happen if we kept the same free market system currently planned took taxes from paychecks then gave society the option to  buy a health care plan of choice with a  possibly immediate  credit for buying a plan  That is basically how the individual mandate works  It tells the uninsured that either they buy healthcare or pay a tax penalty  Rephrasing it doesn t change the legality of the bill 
PoliticalDiscussion,I wonder how my state would go Nebraska is usually Republican but guys like Warren Buffett have a TON of political sway here Btw   unemployment rate here fuck yeah 
PoliticalDiscussion,All you are changing is the mechanism for the transaction   the end result would be identical Do you honestly think that the ACA could be passed again today with only the mechanism of transacting business being changed And changed from a market exchange to a tax government service exchange    I m sorry but I have no faith in my government s ability to be productive so long as they are so evenly divided Nothing of consequence will happen until there is an overwhelming majority of either republicans or democrats in congress   well nothing of consequence other than inaction   So I guess you are right I am not willing to try It is much easier to just save up my money pay off my student loan debt and my mortgage and go to Belize and work remotely 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I like the idea of individual mandate so long as it was efficient but we know government is hideously slow especially at the federal level Besides if we had  different systems we could figure out which is best 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What in reality would be the difference  The Republicans control the House of Representatives and the Democrats no longer have close to a supermajority in the Senate 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s all about degree Sometimes you have to trade certain liberties for others In this case you are deciding between the right to live and the right for privately owned hospitals to reject people who can t pay Personally I would choose the right to live but either side is a respectable choice  As you have probably guessed I am pretty liberal I am actually in support of the health care mandate Not because of the right to life  I don t think insurance will actually save a whole lot more lives when everyone can get emergency care regardless of insurance  but because taxpayers and insured citizens are being forced to pay for those without health insurance directly and indirectly If everyone is required to have health care it should save money for those people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Have you ever read any of Rousseau s writings on the Social Contract That is what we are talking about It s not a  regular contract  Shut your mouth and go educate yourself 
PoliticalDiscussion,The initial question of the post   If the Healthcare Mandate is unconstitutional is it also unconstitutional to require hospitals to provide emergency medical service to people who   can t pay     His answer  I would argue no because Hospitals and Medical Professionals have a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability     that is as cut and dry as it gets man    gt He s making the presumption that both the doctors will get paid and they will provide care  Then he is not responding to the question The question is whether it is unconstitutional to require   hospitals  to provide care The doc s oath has nothing to do with it then Will you please please pleas pay attention    gt You don t have to  Read the OP   gt I don t want to get into the whole atheist thing but I believe if you are making an assertion  i e there is no God you should at least attempt to provide support for it  holy crap  
PoliticalDiscussion,Actually debating your own beliefs is the only way you can truly affirm them  You need to be your own devil s advocate to truly challenge how and what you feel about things to really see if you do or not  Otherwise you re just a stick in the mud who believes something because it s simply what you believe 
PoliticalDiscussion,They already got the current system through  What in reality would be the difference  Plus if something like this garnered public support then I think it would be a bit easier for them to swallow  I ll put this bluntly I don t really like when people simply state  because congress   Why  Because it means you don t care and aren t willing to try  I m sure there is some good quote about apathy and being the end to our freedom but I m too lazy to find it 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well that sounds fabulous   but there are two gigantic problems standing in the way     House of Representatives   Senate
PoliticalDiscussion,The best part of citing that case is if your opponent doesn t know it then you can just say  Justice Stevens and Breyer said in  Columbia v Heller and suddenly it sounds like you have a supreme court case backing you up 
PoliticalDiscussion,Life and death emergency care is less than  of our national medical expenses I don t really think that s a driver of costs   The price pressure on the other  would easily overwhelm any upward pressure from that fractional amount 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why would the RIAA have rights to a sitcom 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The actual reason is because there is no price pressure from consumers  I m having a heart attack  Let s start comparison shopping  Do you have any coupons on you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just go straight to the two dissenting opinions in  Columbia v Heller   Stevens    Breyer   I ll summarize them for you  Stevens says that there s no evidence that the Founding fathers were concerned about guns as used for self defense If they were they would have just enshrined the common law doctrine of self defense into the Constitution rather than referencing militias and arms specifically and they would not have used the language that they did The majority opinion is a strained reading of the Amendment that takes it as literally as possible instead of being in the spirit of the law   He then goes over the text and some of the gun control laws that were in place in the colonies at the time  some of which would have pretty explicitly excluded self defense  Breyer agrees with Stevens and adds in his opinion that the protection of gun ownership is not absolute by any means and that any gun control bill needs to overstep the legitimate interests of the state to be unconstitutional Depending on the fake bill that you re arguing this might also help you out because you can concede the point that the nd Amendment allows for gun ownership as self defense but argue back that this is an allowance which can have  reasonable restrictions placed on it     I am reminded here of the clause  the ineligibility clause that says a congressman can t take an office whose salary was raised while they were a congressman which has on occasion been interpreted to mean that you can t take a position whose salary was raised and then lowered back to the same level as when you started   K  gt  K  gt  K  It s textual reading at its dumbest The Court has gone either way on the issue   Edit Just to add if you re  only arguing that gun control is permitted under the Second Amendment keep in mind that you re arguing a  constitutional position rather than a  policy position  If you want to you can throw policy under a bus  Studies show that gun control isn t very good at stopping crime I don t think that we should have it in place and I oppose most gun control legislation But that doesn t mean that it s unconstitutional In fact the constitutionality of gun control     and so on That can really throw your opponent for a loop if they haven t prepared for the right debate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Funny Yes Relevant to political discussion No 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe that would apply at the state level as well If no one votes in Texas the texas legislature can decide their electoral votes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul fans would claim that it was all part of a conspiracy to keep Ron Paul from becoming president 
PoliticalDiscussion,The same thing that normally happens The President that has been preselected based on fraudulent voting practices would be put in office 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt His original argument presumes that hospitals can be forced to provide free care because of the oaths of there employees I do not see the logic in that  Provide the section of his argument in which he says that He s making the presumption that both the doctors will get paid and they will provide care That s why he moves on to the topic of how it will be paid for rather than dwell on doctor s providing care pro bono    gt Can you link me to a hospital that has signed that oath  You don t have to The people who provide the care already have It would be like saying an army base has to sign the same oath as the soldiers do It would be redundant and unnecessary You can t make a building take an oath  I don t want to get into the whole atheist thing but I believe if you are making an assertion  i e there is no God you should at least attempt to provide support for it Poking holes in the other side s logic does nothing to make you logic stronger The same applies here It makes no sense to me that you can come to a conclusion and then refuse point blank to give any support for it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am just curious why everyone is getting up in arms on the side of Trayvon s family Do not get me wrong it is a horrible tragedy when someone gets killed but not all of the facts are out Is it possible that the man was defending himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,It was my teacher s assignment Hardly my decision He tried to give everybody in the class the opposite side of their own view to give them a challenge I would never do this by choice I enjoy guns for sport I don t want them taken away from me 
PoliticalDiscussion,It galls me how utterly ridiculous people can be Are you one of these people blessed with not having to worry about health insurance Either you have always had it or you have always had some version of it because you have no concept of what being without health insurance does to a human being   It makes me so angry that you are so high and mighty about health insurance when people like me have had to go without depression medication because my job didn t offer health insurance   What makes me even more angry and outraged is how the false equivalencies people like you make to support your views when they simply don t make sense   Everyone isn t required to own a car But if everyone had to use a car at some point in their life it would make a difference Every single person no matter how old or young uses the health care system at some point in their life Every single person from birth to grave interacts with doctors at some point in their lives Even before birth doctors give prenatal care to fetuses Obstetricians give birth to babies Pediatricians treat children general practitioners treat adults and geriatrics treat the aged   Maybe everyone might not need a car But everyone NEEDS health care And if they don t have health care the only other option is for doctors and hospitals to take the costs of treating people for free which they then pass on to people who actually have insurance which results in higher fees   Maybe you feel better by calling me idiotic for talking about the realities of laws in Florida  which are much more stringent than other this federal mandate but none of our majority Republicans or any other person has fought the Constitutionality of those state laws  Maybe the fact is you get off on insulting peoples intelligence because you can t actually back up anything you say with facts just a couple of insulting zingers at the end of your posts   Either way it is sick You can t hold up your argument but you sure spend alot of time trying to tear everyone else s down 
PoliticalDiscussion,What will happen The house votes for a president  What   should  happen Election results are honored presidency stays empty for  years until next election 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is a non sequitur Buying guns is an extension of several provisions of our founding documents namely the authority of congress to raise and support armies and the second amendment Besides the purchase of a firearm is a one time upfront purchase that can be done once and then forgot about Forcing monthly insurance payments on people has no basis in our laws or our history is completely different from the defense of the country and represents an ongoing expense in uncertain times 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a strong opinion I support the DC v Heller decision  I think the big issue you have in arguing against it is that it was specifically arguing for the right to own guns for self defense in the home which is why it applied to handgun ownership  You also are arguing against all private gun ownership including for hunting and sport and I have no idea how you could possibly argue against that aside from quoting founding fathers out of context    Arguing against guns for self defense is a solid argument though I think this case will give you a chance at least 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why in the hell would you debate against your own beliefs You stand the chance of actually convincing people of something you claim not to believe That seems like a rather vile and amoral thing to do I honestly wouldn t do it  Unless you re trying to become a defense lawyer  Good luck I guess There s a mountain of evidence to counter you with 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt  We will not provide medical care without being compensated   I don t have to I am not making the claim that any portion of that oath implies that they WILL provide care for free What you have just done is akin to asking an atheist to provide proof that there is no god    gt  I will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures  that are required   Can you link me to a hospital that has signed that oath   gt His original argument presumes that doctors will provide care and get paid and what must the government do to ensure both things happen  His original argument presumes that hospitals can be forced to provide free care because of the oaths of there employees I do not see the logic in that 
PoliticalDiscussion,State legislatures retain the ability to assign electoral votes  Presumably they would do so if no one voted  Failing that it would go to the house with each state getting one vote  
PoliticalDiscussion,I saw it right after I posted my comment Thank you I am already taking a look into that case Do you have an opinion on the issue 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt i m not disagreeing that he said he would act differently   Well that is a start   gt what i m saying is i don t see any indication that he s attempted to deceive the public about this issue  How do you say  I m not disagreeing that he said he would act differently and then say this I don t get it I really don t His attempt to deceive the public is the way he will act before the election   Also the fact that he accidentally said it on an open mic and not in a press conference or have Jay Carney put it out to the press core is a bit of a giveaway     gt implying that they plan to deal with some of their primary stances in typical romney fashion   Implying you run against a republican in a republican primary differently than you run against a democrat That has nothing to do with acting differently with the same person  or country before and after the election Your example is a twist of the man s words as he spoke to a reporter My example is Obama s exact words that he intended only Medevev and Putin to hear but accidentally spoke into a mic  Although you don t spin it as hard as Pravda       Mitt Romney Out of touch out of date unelectable  jpeg   gt Electing Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States of America would be like appointing a serial paedophile as a kindergarten teacher a rapist as a janitor at a girls dormitory or a psychopath with a fixation on knives as a kitchen hand  Guess who russia s state controlled media endorses for president Mr flexibility   
PoliticalDiscussion,You have the option to not not drive and not pay for car insurance People who ride bikes everywhere would be outraged if there was a federal law mandating that they bought health insurance just like people who are healthy and don t typically do dangerous things are outraged about having to buy health insurance   Another argument is that if you drive without insurance you have a nontrivial chance of hitting someone something and causing thousands of dollars in damage If you can t afford to pay for your damage that person is really screwed This argument holds less water because if you don t pay for health insurance there is a nontrivial chance that you will require health services that you can t afford and society at large will have to pay the bill This isn t as bad as the driving situation though because the costs of your poor decisions are dispersed over lots of people instead of landing in one person s lap Also there is a nontrivial chance that you will go your whole life without medical need and will have paid into the system without ever getting anything back 
PoliticalDiscussion,True    I edited my comment and you probably missed it  I suggest looking into the transcripts of the arguments from DC v heller since  justices dissented you should have plenty of arguments from that case you could use 
PoliticalDiscussion,Car insurance companies drop customers for being high risk every day  
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure gun control was as rampant an issue back then because of the necessity for weaponry But it is possible that I can find a few I figure they didn t talk about the second Amendment much due to its very concise wording 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Constitution is worded rather vaguely yes I am definitely going to attempt to use this 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m sure you can find some founding fathers to quote out of context which would support your argument  I feel for your plight this is a tough one to argue as someone who believes the opposite  You basically have to disprove the supreme court s logic from DC V heller  That decision would be a good thing to research for this topic because those are the arguments you will face on the other side  Start here    The audio and transcripts of the arguments are available as well 
PoliticalDiscussion,The whole Constitution is written rather vaguely Use this to your advantage 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Its common practice and so there are no tricky legal waters  Supreme Courts change That was a major facet of the legal arguments yesterday and considering how conservative this one is shaping up to be it s not as cut and dry as you imply I m not saying SCOTUS will rule that it is coercion but the fact it was even debated throws it back into contention  I m taking issue with your like to like comparison of veterinarians and doctors when they are not the same I would like for you to point out the part of the Hippocratic Oath that says  We will not provide medical care without being compensated  Simply because it doesn t say anything about pro bono work doesn t prove your point that medical coverage should only be provided when payment is available   I will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures  that are required  That quote is from the article you linked to It doesn t say  All measures that are required as long as I get paid  His original argument presumes that doctors will provide care and get paid and what must the government do to ensure both things happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am arguing in agreement to the quoted statement Which is really the opposite of what I do believe but that should make this far more interesting 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt so that all U S citizens have the best chance to live  Providing insurance would help even more Where does one draw the line 
PoliticalDiscussion,Almost all of the electors would still vote the only ones who might not are those who are required by the law in their state to vote in accordance with the popular vote in their states They would thus be forced to abstain However these states are in the extreme minority 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you in agreement or opposition to the quoted statement 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree  Even in manufacturing we have moved passed using unions  Are folks working in auto plants in  right to work states worse off than their counterparts in  union states  Nope  Except for the fact that one group is growing in employment and the other in decline  Sure those in RtW states may get paid less and their benefits are not as gold plated but it s equivalent to the level of their work on a global national scale  The nice thing is it can be adjusted rapidly to meet the economic demands  In a union shop I envision this to be quite difficult thanks to the presence of contracts and powerful union tools like strikes  Unions are long dead and the only place they maintain any power is in the public sector and even there taxpayers and politicians patience with them is wearing thin  
PoliticalDiscussion,Obamacare requires all taxpayers to have health insurance or pay a fine   If all taxpayers were required to own a car you might have a point  However they aren t so you don t  This isn t difficult for people with an ounce of intelligence but it s clear that you don t fall into that group 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t understand why it s ok to make you buy car insurance but not health care insurance Please explain 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That is not a reason to force health insurance  And it s no reason to deny it   gt Public insurance has the exact same problem the end consumer has no reason to care about the cost of the product they consume   Health care is not a consumer item in the same ballpark as what people normally think of as consumer items    
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you kidding They d be thrilled With no voters they could finally all do what they wanted with no consequences 
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry I did not receive your newsletter with the rules you require    
PoliticalDiscussion,   I don t see anything about working for free   Ah but maybe its just that fact that they take an oath that you are focusing on      Yeah  Vets take an oath    gt He also didn t say anything about doctors providing care without compensation  Yes  yes he did He said that because Doctors have a solemn duty that they can be forced to care for people without compensation That is the entire gist of their argument regardless of the fact that it is the Hospital that is forced to provide care without compensation    gt The current law tries to fix the final part of the government s goal  I agree  and its a good fix but could be better  Personally I would rather have single payer or the Germany or French system    gt You might get into tricky legal waters when you say  deny federal funds to states that don t comply because then you get into possible coercion on behalf of the federal government  That is how the federal government operates Remember back when the speed limit for the whole country was mph well that was imposed by the federal government by simply withholding highway funds to any state that did not impose that limit Same with DL license age drunk driving laws and all sorts of things If the state wants to give up the money they can ignore the federal guideline   Its common practice and so there are no tricky legal waters 
PoliticalDiscussion,There are a number of plans to end the deficit and reduce the debt  None of them will happen since the rich control the war chest and the old and poor make up the voters 
PoliticalDiscussion,No you were not If you were you would have put quotes around it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Because food and medical care are not interchangeable nouns  That is not a reason to force health insurance   gt Agreed Let s get private insurance out of this  And replace it with public insurance Public insurance has the exact same problem the end consumer has no reason to care about the cost of the product they consume The problem isn t public private the problem is insurance covering things that should not be covered by insurance 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is really easy to be a dick on an anonymous site like Reddit but that doesn t make you better smarter or anywhere near right   I just said that in the state of Florida there is a law which says I have to buy auto insurance I HAVE to in order to have a car The state MANDATES that I must buy auto insurance    None of which force you to buy something or pay a fine   Your words right Are you stupid Or just slightly retarded from being such a longterm dickhead EVERY FINE GIVEN BY A POLICE OFFICER FOR A TRAFFIC INFRACTION IS A FINE OR PENALTY   What is worse in the state of Florida if I am in a car I HAVE TO WEAR MY SEAT BELT Maybe I don t have to get a license to breathe but I do have to get a license to go fishing in the state of Florida If it is Constitutional to do these things in the state of Florida why suddenly can the Federal Government not enforce laws which affect interstate commerce and the general welfare both of which are ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION AS THE JOB OF CONGRESS DUMBASS   You know honestly I wish I could have thought that people wouldn t make idiotic statements like  There are no laws which make you pay fines but unfortunately we are surrounded by idiots who speak about things before they even think 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thing is unions just don t really exist in those kinds of business Unions exist in very specific areas If they die naturally  because the kind of work they represent no longer gets done then they die   but while that work is being done we need them 
PoliticalDiscussion,i m not disagreeing that he said he would act differently  what i m saying is i don t see any indication that he s attempted to deceive the public about this issue  verbatim romney guy  gt  Well I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign  Fehrnstrom responded  Everything changes It s almost like an Etch A Sketch You can kind of shake it up and   restart all of over again     implying that they plan to deal with some of their primary stances in typical romney fashion 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oddly enough I don t totally disagree with you I think that the old model is dead I just don t think the service model we are trying right now has any chance in hell of succeeding It requires an even higher level of energy input than the old one and energy inputs are getting low What we need is to adapt to a lower energy society one where we make most of our own shit instead of buying it where re use and upcylcle are the primary ways of dealing with old stuff I don t think busting unions will help any of that 
PoliticalDiscussion,But vets don t have the same duty Veterinarians do not take the Hippocratic oath doctors do so therefore their solemn duty is very much a part of this debate so that s where the difference is and with respect where your comparison between the two professions is flawed  He also didn t say anything about doctors providing care without compensation I believe what he is saying is that it is the governments job to make sure everyone can be treated doctor s fulfill their moral duty and the taxpayers insurers don t take an unreasonable financial hit The current law tries to fix the final part of the government s goal  I don t necessarily  agree with your solution  I would rather see a single payer system but it s hardly a bad one You might get into tricky legal waters when you say  deny federal funds to states that don t comply because then you get into possible coercion on behalf of the federal government 
PoliticalDiscussion,No The government s one and only purpose is to protect the rights of the citizens One of our rights is the right to life  along with liberty and the pursuit of happiness  Based on this the government must require hospitals to provide medical services so that all U S citizens have the best chance to live 
PoliticalDiscussion,Donald Trump votes for himself 
PoliticalDiscussion,sorry  didn t check the context  My response was a direct response to the notion that because we non doctors think that doctors have  a deeply engrained belief that it is their solemn civil duty to treat anyone who walks in the door to the best of their ability  that we can force hospitals to pay for that treatment   Lets keep in mind what is going on here Doctors do not work for free They are paid by hospitals No matter what the doctor s beliefs are they are on staff and are getting paid by the hour The Hospital is the institution being forced to pay for the care of individuals who are unable to pay They are paying for the the doctor s time the nurse s time and all the equipment lighting power needles blood  everything   Given that fact I don t know why  a deeply engrained belief of  solemn civil duty has anything to do with this Hospitals don t have beliefs they are not people   Now to get back to your response You are not actually responding to what I have said The argument was that doctors have a solemn duty and THUS they can be forced to provide care without reimbursement Vets have that same duty so under that previous logic they too could be forced to provide care without pay   Clearly hospitals are forced to provide care  not because of some solemn duty but because we as a country believe in caring for individuals in need so much that we compel our hospitals to care for the needy This has nothing to do with the solemn duty of doctors and everything to do with the solemn duty of the state   IMHO the federal government had a better option Deny federal funds to any state that doe no implement a mandate or raise taxes for all and provide a tax credit to individuals who buy insurance Done and Done 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s a good solution 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Being forced to pay for something that you might use forces you to spend your money  Didn t you just describe taxes Are you saying we shouldn t have taxes 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt romney s guys said  we don t have to do the things we said we would do or believe the things we said we believe   Uh   you have a link to that quote   gt but you keep framing this as obama saying one thing then changing his mind when as far as i am aware he never said a first thing to change from   No I keep framing it that Obama said  Give me space This is my last election and after my election I have more flexibility  You are the one that insists this sentence does not mean that Obama will act one way before the election and a different way after the election  Which is rather silly of you 
PoliticalDiscussion,ok then if you didn t join up when young and want to join later face a charge to  buy medicare  which this cost would correlate to getting penalized under mandate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Read  Seeing   by Joe Saramago   it is the premise of the book   
PoliticalDiscussion,Good  They re not competitive to last in a global economy or even a national one  It s why  Right to Work states are killing it when it comes to employment levels  Unions can only last in large industrialized societies where you have large groups of unskilled labor working in unskilled jobs  Last time I checked the vast majority of our workforce is somewhat educated  college or tech degrees and working in providing services or contractor roles  Our society has simply evolved passed the rigid scheme of unionization   it s a dead model it s inflexible and bad for our economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,First off not my argument but I ll take it up anyway  The entire premise of the government s argument is that health care is unique There should be no higher priority for a government than the protection of its citizens lives so therefore letting people die in the parking lot because they don t have insurance isn t an acceptable practice The only other option is to treat someone and have them pay for their medical bills These expenses can become astronomical so someone who can t afford insurance in the first place has no possibility of paying them back Those bills still have to get paid so the burden is passed to the taxpayer and insurance companies resulting in higher taxes and higher premiums   Vets do no have the same duty to treat the sick at any cost because we place higher value on human life than animal life Saving a human life takes precedence over cost but cost takes precedence over saving an animal life according to both the government hospitals and society at large 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt That is a power grab  FTFY  
PoliticalDiscussion,Look man you ve got two options cling to a system  status quo that is fucking over or adapt to a new one  hybrid of both while focusing on services   Our economy is predominantly driven by small businesses which offer services  They employ a large number of people and do so effectively  The socioeconomic model that originated in the early th century is gone kaput  Small businesses in a service based economy are awesome they tend to be efficient have low overhead and are extremely competitive  It s the new model now we must adjust our society to it  This means massive changes to our approach in taxation education funding and healthcare reform 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because nobody makes poor decisions when they were young that they regret later in life 
PoliticalDiscussion,You did not base your argument on the value of human life 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s why it needs unions to be middle class If you have an auto plant that is mixed union and non union the union members will be quickly removed with no new ones being hired They cost more and demand more rights It s the whole idea of the union to provide a fair wage for people who are working hard but don t have a high degree of specialized knowledge 
PoliticalDiscussion,Simply saying that I have done more research than you are crediting in this area Not an expert not an authority   but I don t have to cite sources to refute something that has no cited sources or actual numbers If you provide actual data I will be more than happy to refute anything I can and if I can t then I will be happy to alter my stance with respect to that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thing is a service economy isn t sustainable It s failing right now in fact A sercice economy requires that there be someone with the money to purchase those services and the idea that we will be the high end service and management sector for the third world who will be the manufacturing and raw goods is untenable because as those countries industrialize we are starting to discover that they are completely capable of being the service and management sectors for themselves We simply don t have any real advantages and because of that you will see the North American economy tun into the ground Now if the change to a technological society that does just in time manufacturing happens   we are even more fucked Sorry but current energy levels are not something that will continue to exist There isn t an alternative to oil and the universe doesn t owe us one I figure the n d century might look more like the nineteenth for most people 
PoliticalDiscussion,Are you saying an animal life is of the same value as a human life 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ron Paul would win 
PoliticalDiscussion,I disagree  What you re seeing is the death of the  Blue Model of existence the concept that you can employ masses of people in huge factories in big cities while funding huge pension plans education systems and healthcare systems  That model is now dead and will never return  The new model is going to be based on small business providing services   and such a scheme is not conducive to unionization  If you d like there is a whole bunch of articles on the topic by Walter Russell Mead     
PoliticalDiscussion,Oh okay then You re an authority I didn t realize excuse me  
PoliticalDiscussion,I can see that in the sense of  trades like iron working plumbing etc  Because such things hearken back to the days of  guilds  where it s an organization of independent professionals who maintain their own standards and training  But when you have an auto plant   that s a bit different in my opinion  It s not really a  skill based trade it s just a job that anyone can do 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because food and medical care are not interchangeable nouns   gt My point is that the price of healthcare is skyrocketing BECAUSE of insurance  Agreed  Let s get private insurance out of this  
PoliticalDiscussion,You cant grow the economy fast enough to keep up wuth republican tax cuts if you want to end deficits We saw that in the Reagan years Nicely said 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was quoting Mitt Romney my friend  
PoliticalDiscussion,The government would be very very afraid   more afraid than they are of OWS 
PoliticalDiscussion,There was a time when the govt was not involved in heatlh care  Disease   quack medicines abounded   I don t think you really want to go back to that    You can t claim that people going bankrupt is a good thing for the economy  Ms Brown was a small business owner  If she lost her business employees lost jobs  Creditors were screwed out of the money she owed to them You can shrug your shoulders but I don t think it should cost people everything they have to get health care    The problems with the current system are that people with pre existing conditions are priced out of the market unless they happen to be Mitt Romney  And as you said they need insurance more than health people    And then there is the fact that the easiest way for insurance companies to make money is to spend something like  cents out of every dollar on themselves  administrative costs and leave  cents to pay for the actual health care  note that the govt is not involved in how private insurance companies currently allot the dollars paid to them by patients  The ACA would have required that they keep costs down to  on the dollar  Japan does it for less than  cents and they also have an individual mandate   The current system also increases the bill from the MD s office as they have to dedicate time and staff to sort through the maze of paperwork that has been created by having a myriad of companies with different billing different payment structures etc    They also drop patients altogether through rescission  I don t know any other business that is allowed to take thousands of dollars from their clients and then refuse to serve them because it s too expensive  I don t know why we as consumers put up with that    We pay thousands of dollars more for our health care than citizens in other countries  And we have poorer outcomes with lower life expectancies infant mortalities and in many other ways  The US may have the best  reactive health care system but we suck at being proactive and at general health  And it IS a national security issue as well   more people have been denied to the military than ever due to poor health  Also there is evidence that microbes are evolving in response to antibiotics  People with little or no access to health care are going to be vectors for spreading those diseases    Lastly I think we need to remove health insurance as an employee benefit and find some other way to distribute health care  It hurts businesses in that it makes it harder for people to be entrepenurial  because they don t want to lose their health insurance and it makes it harder for businesses to compete in the ever growing int l markets where health insurance isn t part of the overhead for businesses in every other country  And the whole contraception religious freedom fiasco has also highlighted the fact that we need to unlink the two    Frankly I think we need to go to a public option  As long as congress doesn t remove the ability of the govt to negotiate prices  as they did with Medicare Part D  it should remove several of the factors I described above 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that the move to a service based economy is largely responsible for the death of the middle class In the end it will be the death of the American economy 
PoliticalDiscussion,How about instead of a mandate requiring insurance have a requirement that in order for young people to be eligible for medicare later in life they would have had to have bought insurance when they were young  Or something to that effect 
PoliticalDiscussion,They do but not within a specific shop Shops are either union or non union and if you have a shop that is mixed you have a union that has no value at all Most people who are carpenters choose to be union because it means they actually earn a living at it as an example 
PoliticalDiscussion,Libertarian party anyone 
PoliticalDiscussion,I have a plan to end he debt within  years depending on how much we want to cut It involves tax hikes and ending of loopholes for the rich as well as social security cuts I should post it somewhere   
PoliticalDiscussion,Derringers at  paces perhaps Or perhaps some fencing As long as top hats and monocles are involved I shall cast a wager on this most gentlemanly sporting occurrence and remember it fondly 
PoliticalDiscussion,Physician salaries in the U S are much higher than in any other developed countries I m not sure why exactly this is but it s been that way for a long time now   However technology is the biggest force driving our rate of increased health care expenditures  This is happening not just in the U S  but in all countries We aren t the only ones struggling with increasing spending on health care though our level is much higher to begin with   So your friend s statement has  some truth to it 
PoliticalDiscussion,The last anti debt republican elected to presidency was Herbert hoover 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The word  corporation is not mentioned in the decision  Then why did your OP state  Since the corporations are people  If  corporation does not appear in the decision then your assertion that corporations are people displays a misunderstanding of the ruling 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can t really compare the government to private jobs Even without unions government employees get better pay and often times get better retirement 
PoliticalDiscussion,well certainly i am ok saying that this factor increases genetic variation but my problem is making the conclusion from this to say that increased genetic variation is always a positive thing for adaptability  really i think the whole question that i was trying and apparently failing to get at was if everyone lives do good genetic variations outpace bad genetic variations 
PoliticalDiscussion,War with Iran has been inevitable for quite some time now but nothing ever seems to come of it The Daily Show had a good bit about how all three countries involved have elections this year a lot of the recently inflamed rhetoric is just campaign grandstanding 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well which is it I can t frame or I frame every day 
PoliticalDiscussion,There will most certainly be no  invasion at any point in the near or probably distant future 
PoliticalDiscussion,You couldn t frame a discussion to save your life Gnome  Every damn day you submit some scenario with loaded framing and every day I roll my eyes 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would you mind going into more detail  It s pretty clear that both society and medicine have allowed individuals to reproduce who would otherwise not be able to do so in the wild  While the negative traits they had are now propagated the increased population creates a higher chance that particular beneficial traits are produced  I don t know enough to say if this is a benefit or detriment 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well obviously it s a joke  at least meant to be a joke    Besides it d be the MPAA nu 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m just saying from a logical standpoint the original intent doesn t hold up  It basically means that States can simply erode all our rights  Let s say it s the s and the th Amendment didn t pass yet   that means the State of New York can pretty much do whatever it wants to it s citizens  Quarter troops in their homes take their guns suppress free speech and make them all Protestants  Can it also deny them a right to fair trial as well  Just execute people over shoplifting  Where does it end  I mean by your interpretation the Constitution and the Bill of Rights doesn t really protect our Rights at all   just from the folks in Washington DC     Further Logic   What s the point of protecting the right of the people to be armed for the survival of a free state if a State can simply disarm them  As long as someone within the loop can take your Rights away then it s not really a Right at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,Likewise 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m a proponent of government where it is needed and free market economy where it isn t  Health care is one apparent area where it is needed  If you would like to confine someone to red or blue squares please look elsewhere 
PoliticalDiscussion,and the B stealth bomber can strike from continental U S or Guam
PoliticalDiscussion,It doesn t change the fact that extended life and not dying in youth makes the human species more adaptable I honestly don t think you understand natural selection or evolution No offense A lot of people don t and I m no expert but I know enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are going to need a cite for that  I do not believe that number  But even if it were true people are creatures of habit  Unless the subsidies of the exchanges are substantially larger than the employer system they aren t going to switch and keeping both sets of subsidies is ludicrous  Far better to simply eliminate the employer subsidy than create a whole new set 
PoliticalDiscussion,Would it be safe to conclude that you are a proponent of smaller government If it is I m not sure you can reconcile that with your desire to have the Big Ginormous Federal Government administer an even bigger collection of pick n pay plans 
PoliticalDiscussion,it might make us more adaptable to continued advancement but a sudden regression technologically could be extremely detrimental 
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess that s true I mean I assume if the government was determined to attack they would find a way no matter what I just wasn t sure what effect the specifics of our relationship with Iraq would have on the situation  In any event I really hope an actual attack never comes to pass 
PoliticalDiscussion,you don t think that otherwise deadly but easily curable things can be completely hidden by modern medicine  let us assume that people in great pain are less likely to reproduce in this case a perfect example is wisdom teeth easy surgery but i think as time goes on because the trait is completely hidden sexually it will not be eliminated by sexual selection 
PoliticalDiscussion,If this is still any indication of things to come Russia and China will be the end game    
PoliticalDiscussion,Iraq Turkey Kuwait    there s no shortage of bases there 
PoliticalDiscussion,this is a lot closer to what i was trying to get at than what a lot of the other responses have thought i was saying 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t know the specifics of U S military access in various countries so I have to ask  is the U S still able to use Iraq itself as a base to launch attacks from anymore I know there are still security forces there but with the end of the conflict and the removal of the last combat troops is it something the Iraqi government would allow 
PoliticalDiscussion, r conspiracy is that way     gt 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ninth amendment just because it is not guaranteed in the constitution does not mean it is not a right What the issue of gun ownership boils down to is if the government should be able to tell you that you cannot own something 
PoliticalDiscussion,But individuals can get subsidies now   What was the figure Married can get subsidized up to  dollars That s a big deal 
PoliticalDiscussion,as long as it doesn t interfere with sweeps week this fall
PoliticalDiscussion,But it doesn t eliminate the giant tax subsidy that creates employer provided care in the first place  The exchanges are mostly meaningless without that 
PoliticalDiscussion,no it really wouldn t be i hate the direction the country is going just as much as the next guy but you can t seriously think a leaderless country with no capability to do basically anything would uh work at all
PoliticalDiscussion,I guess what I m saying is there is an option to the individual mandate portion  An easy fix if you will to make it legal  The current argument in the Supreme Court  at least to some is whether it would be possible to simply strike that one portion down ask congress to fix it  I don t know how far the current congress could go in editing beyond what the court said was invalid   
PoliticalDiscussion,That is what I was thinking I m was thinking that aliens could do it to us 
PoliticalDiscussion,This bill does decouple it from employment through the exchange 
PoliticalDiscussion,Republican landslide The Diebold machines have already been programmed 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can have artificial selection in humans if you started breeding people like dogs There needs to be a person making the decision of who gets to breed and with whom based on a desired trait It s like a stricter version of eugenics 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well no I m not saying the Gov t would buy the insurance directly  Take that same idea but give the individual a choice as to which carrier it wants 
PoliticalDiscussion,It will not happen for at least another year beyond that it s pretty hard to predict  Don t let it keep you up at night 
PoliticalDiscussion,So you re still going to argue in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary that the  intent of the Bill of Rights was that it would apply to the states as well From the Preamble to the Bill of Rights   gt THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added  I mean leaving aside whether it should now apply to States via the th how can you make the intent argument Do you really think that it was their intent that the nd should apply to the States as well as the federal government but that they then just failed completely at enforcing any of that stated intent and that the Supreme Court was simply mistaken when it ruled in  Barron even though Marshall was alive when the Bill of Rights was written and ratified and was nominated by one of the guys who wrote and ratified them What evidence can be mounted that the intent of Bill of Rights was wildly misread when they were ratified but is being correctly read now Because from where I m standing there is none 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt whether they regain insurance in the next year or the next few years is immaterial because their current state of being uninsured is the problem  Not really if you go for insurance for as little as a day you count so the vast majority of the official count actually does have insurance     gt And how do you define someone as  genuinely unable to buy insurance   Actually I wouldn t  I should have said  people genuinely suffering from being unable to get medical care   Personally I do not have insurance because at the present it is cheaper to go without it  I am part of that vast statistic but I am not suffering  Health insurance is not the same as health care and we should stop confusing the two   gt This bill makes it a lot easier for those  of people in any given year to acquire insurance  Not really  of the  million more than  are immigrants which the bill doesn t help  Millions more qualify for existing programs and so don t need new ones  And if the Massachusetts plan is any guide premiums will continue to get more expensive so affordability will remain a problem   If you really want to make insurance easier to get step one is de coupling it from employment by ending the enormous tax subsidies that encourage employer provided care  That will overnight dramatically increase the size and robustness of the currently meager individual market 
PoliticalDiscussion,No I also think putting  pages into one piece of legislation is equally idiotic but then that s the way our system works isn t it  Keep tacking crap on until it s unmanageable  Though the priorities of  reform for many seem to be with legalizing pot  Yes it s an extreme segue but my point is people don t want real reform they want trivial titillations 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I would say a better discussion topic is the effect of human society on evolution The fact that a higher percentage of people now more than ever have the ability to reproduce weakens our ability to adapt via natural selection  Actually the complete opposite Having more people alive makes us more adaptable So we are actually stronger better at adapting 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think a better way to look at it is that if all medicine were removed from the face of the earth we could be worse off as a species than if it never existed  It s not a great topic of discussion  I would say a better discussion topic is the effect of human society on evolution  The fact that a higher percentage of people now more than ever have the ability to reproduce weakens our ability to adapt via natural selection 
PoliticalDiscussion,Better than the alternatives 
PoliticalDiscussion,You can have artificial selection but I m not  on the complete definition if it can include the human species or not 
PoliticalDiscussion,Within any given year  of the population is uninsured   within a  year window  of people have insurance at some point This means that the  in any given year that are uninsured do not remain uninsured ie they desire to have insurance    So yes they are temporarily uninsured and it s a rolling population But it s still a problem because every year there are  million people without insurance whether they regain insurance in the next year or the next few years is immaterial because their current state of being uninsured is the problem    This doesn t even take into account the people who are underinsured   who think they have health insurance but have only the thinnest of coverage    And how do you define someone as  genuinely unable to buy insurance     Is it someone who could very well have health insurance if they d just pay  dollars a month Or is it someone who is denied health insurance regardless of how much they pay    Several years ago I went uninsured for a couple of years because it would have cost me  dollars a month Technically I guess I was able to buy insurance but I wasn t willing I wanted to be insured but not at a cost that was greater than my mortgage payment    This bill makes it a lot easier for those  of people in any given year to acquire insurance   and for many of them at a lower cost This should ensure that we get to a  insured rate because it a makes it easier to re acquire insurance b retain insurance in the event that your circumstances change 
PoliticalDiscussion,One could argue the opposite  That by reducing the child mortality rate and allowing a wider range of genetic variation to pass on those genes the rate of natural evolution increases  The more variety there is in the gene pool the more likely there is to be some variant that will survive and or thrive in a new environment   Something I find fascinating about human populations is the ever increasing importance of ideas  memes over genetics  genes   More and more often we celebrate people who had influential ideas that spread throughout the society rather than those who had lots of children  Ideas can spread mingle and spawn new ideas much faster than genes can     I m so glad this isn t r askscience I can share my BS ideas that are only marginally supported by research 
PoliticalDiscussion,So let me preface there are different approaches to constitutional interpretation  e g  living constitution v originalism v judicial restraint  and how we weigh these arguments is to some degree a matter of opinion You can ascribe to a theory with different political beliefs or to none at all Justice Scalia is famous conservative originalist Justice Huge Black was a far more liberal originalist I tend to find the Second Amendment useful to think about in originalist terms  though perhaps not strictly  and it it seems to be important for your prompt I second reading the Heller Case and the dissenting opinions since I ll be referencing them a bit I ll offer you an opinion I don t hear too often an originalist reading that is not conservative It falls somewhere in between your prompt The gun control people certainly have it wrong the second amendment doesn t tie gun ownership with some formally organized militia But the individual rights pro gun people also have it wrong The amendment isn t about your right to own weapons at your whim either Also I m doing a bit of cutting and pasting from much longer old notes and editing a bit so I apologize if something doesn t make sense and it s a little incoherent   By the way I think there s a good theoretical philosophical argument for gun rights to which I am personally sympathetic Unfortunately I don t think they are protected that they fall under the Second Amendment especially as it was  originally intended I m well aware of more recent interpretations But I find the originalist view especially as Scalia presents it to be narrow historical ignorant and facile The Second Amendments is not  really about weapons or guns per se it s simply very outdated and not really applicable anymore The Second Amendment serves a very different United States with a very different vision of democracy    First let me briefly sketch the problems with modern readings The Second Amendment reads  A well regulated Militia being necessary of the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed  The gun control folks think the militia is basically a national guard a small group of semi professional volunteers and deny that it applies to  regular citizens and emphasize the first clause The individual rights approach correctly points out the flaw in this argument that the second clause clarifies a right of  the people  but almost ignore the causal thrust of the first clause and extend it to everything a person can do with a gun short of shooting someone who doesn t deserve it They also fail to account for the fact that the right refers to  the people collectively not individual private  persons  Some go on to say it doesn t make sense to make this distinction and that  collective rights are meaningless Both miss the mark   Let me set the scene of the early days of democracy and begin by drawing a distinction between  rights and rights By the former I really mean something closer to privileges such as voting  rights  as opposed to say something closer to human rights or natural rights I ll use quotation marks to make this distinction The Framers doubtlessly believed in natural rights but they re not quite the same as the  rights of a citizen since citizenship especially back then required indispensable service to the state in various manners including jury duty and militia service These duties of citizenship grant privileges like voting  rights  This is why the modern day objection to  collective rights strange and incoherent Voting  rights are really political  rights  and only make sense in a collective democratic context Sure these days we have decoupled citizenship from most of its duties but the Framers most certainly did not Besides both we today and the Framers stratify  rights a variety of ways  Their Constitution is rife with distinctions between  people and  persons  even  other persons and  indians  distinct classes of their own  with  people clearly referring to the body public acting in its public capacity and  persons referring to private individuals We don t vote people into office We vote persons  but the people not persons are doing the voting  The Fourth Amendment starts with  people  but uses  persons to clarify an individual private capacity Persons did not ordain to form the United States the People did We the People are not private persons but the public the collective the  demos  in its democratic capacity Consider that  th century women were non part of  the people proper lacking  direct voting  rights  they also neither served on juries nor the militia those duties that bequeath us those rights in the first place  but did have the rights as  persons  like due process freedom of speech and of worship    In particular the citizenship and its privileges were dependent upon military service only that military service was not to the army but to the local militia The framers has a distrust of standing armies because they could be loyal to their commanders and injurious to local liberty  Federalist No   But they also had a very strong belief in national defense  see Federalists No    in fact it is one the main reasons why the Constitution was adopted in the first place  that s it s own issue that I won t delve into here  Notice that there is no standing army in the Constitution only one temporarily composed of militiamen but that there is a standing navy The reasoning here was that a local militia would not be injurious to liberty because the militia was the local body of the people themselves As Hamilton put it in Federalist No      gt Where in the name of common sense are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons our brothers our neighbors our fellow citizens What shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings sentiments habits and interests   This dovetails nicely with how th century Americans understood this language the  militia and  people referred to essentially the same body Even if I give you that collective rights are unfounded because it doesn t make sense to grant militiamen additional  rights  militia is not a subcategory of  the people  It is  the people  Note the language in the  Militia Act of the  nd Congress which included  each and every able bodied white male citizen between the age of eighteen years and under the age of forty five years as part of the militia This is virtually every citizen who can be expected to physically fight This is the core principle of republican democracy   the people is  the militia those that serve vote those that vote serve and the militia is integral  to the structure of the republican state as envisioned by the Framers   Jury  rights are really the same thing both a duty and privilege conferred to citizens  It s a similar institution falling under local purview both formal and regulated but explicitly protected from governmental whims that might undermine local integrity and due process The Second Amendment does the same thing and protects the integrity of local militias from potentially deconstructive governmental meddling They are two sides to same coin of citizenship but both of which are collective and fundamentally political  rights  you can t participate in them outside the system This is the same reason why polling does not equate to voting Just as any group of persons cannot make decrees of guilt or innocence and claim to be a jury persons who pursue firearms cannot claim to be part of a militia In the first case they are gangs or mobs and in the second they are gun enthusiasts in both cases they are not acting in their official capacity as citizens   These public duties and privileges should not be surprising This was how democracy came to be historically a voice in governance in exchange for  military services rendered  This is  more or less how it worked in Athens  note how democracy expanded when Athenian power was predicated on its oar powered navy and Republican Rome  Plebeian soldiers refused to fight an important moment lest they received some voting power  It s a pretty good argument if I am willing to die for my country I should have a say in it This citizen soldier is the basis for republican democracy and the model used by the Framers as compared to our own current liberal democracy  Of course the US doesn t work that way anymore We don t have a public militia system which is why I say the Second Amendment is largely irrelevant An individual access to firearms in a private capacity is just not what the the amendment intended because  every citizen used to have one since  every citizen  more or less  was in the militia    Now I ll right a reply to this where I talk more about Scalia s majority in Heller where I extend my case a bit I want to stress that I think this logic can stand on it s own  edit although I certainly didn t go through it in enough detail I just sketched it out a bit  The US was just a different sort of a republic back in the day Having access to a firearm was an integral part of local and national defense in the  th century but it s just not applicable in the same way Again I am personally sympathetic to the whole fire arms as potential step on gross governmental tyranny on a philosophical level but that s just not what the Second Amendment is about There s so much more to it especially from an originalist reading  there might be other ways to read to read it this way and I think there are but I ll stick to this reading for now  
PoliticalDiscussion,Wrong the best option right now is a government that provides free healthcare for all Period It s a right and it should be treated as such 
PoliticalDiscussion,Natural selection has to do with determining who is most able to reproduce  What characteristic determine this vary from species to species and from region to region  It may be that being able to find your own food supply or being able to survive until you re able to survive are no longer metrics by which humans are naturally selected but that doesn t mean there aren t other criteria 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The majority of people without insurance really do want insurance  This is not at all obvious  Of the people without insurance which are a small minority to begin with virtually all are either are illegal immigrants who wont get insurance under any system are only temporarily without insurance  because they are between jobs providers  eligible for existing government programs but not enrolled in them or deliberately choosing not to buy insurance  The number of people who are genuinely unable to buy insurance  and remember getting insurance IS NOT the same as getting health care is tiny 
PoliticalDiscussion,The really sad thing about this comment is that you actually believe you re being witty 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If the Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate  If the right wingers put the corporations above the people it s time to charge them with treason Every day people are suffering and it s about time the people fought back 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think it s pretty dumb to throw away  pages of legal text But that s just me  Dumber that writing a  page bill that even the people who wrote it admit they don t understand and is chock full of  crap like this  
PoliticalDiscussion,Evolution works on the margin  Medicine keeping people selects for the trait  people who are easier to keep alive with medicine  rather than  people who survive better with no medicine   Pretty much by definition you can t stop natural selection  Any set of circumstances select for something 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt what would happen if we kept the same free market system currently planned  Our system is not a free market system has never been a free market system and is not planned to be a free market system   gt took taxes from paychecks then gave society the option to  buy a health care plan of choice with a  possibly immediate  credit for buying a plan  This is basically the Paul Ryan plan for medicare  Everyone would get a voucher with which they can buy the kind of insurance they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,It seems to me that if you want to be regarded as a famed activist you should actually have to you know achieve some sort of tangible result 
PoliticalDiscussion,That quote is absolutely false The founding fathers DID intend for the populace to be extremely well armed lest the government become too powerful and a revolution was necessary 
PoliticalDiscussion,Oddly enough this was forwarded to me by some one who has worked in the banking industry for over  years successful business owner and CFO of a major financial company        sad isn t it 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They d still have a police and military apparatus at their disposal They d still have a police and military apparatus at their disposal  In the hypothetical scenario that people did not recognize the validity of the US government and hence did not vote the likelihood of police and military supporting the government would be low At the very least you have to concede that some portions of the military would defect in support of the public   gt Regardless it won t matter because the American government is legitimate   You cannot discount the possibility that one day it may be seen as illegitimate  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security   Declaration of Independence   gt is kept in line because people can vote  Kept in line With the interests of lobbying corporations perhaps 
PoliticalDiscussion,do you actually think having no president would be a good idea
PoliticalDiscussion,Nearly every Republican has been running at least in part on the idea of repealing  Obamacare  Now if they had the legislative decision between salvaging it or letting it crumble do you honestly think they would choose the former  Come on 
PoliticalDiscussion,They d still have a police and military apparatus at their disposal not to mention plenty of cash and credit I think they d do alright even if they were popularly seen as illegitimate domestically Regardless it won t matter because the American government is legitimate and is kept in line because people can vote No one will snatch the right to participate in government away from the American people 
PoliticalDiscussion,i really don t think i am by keeping people alive who wouldn t have survived to mate if there were no such thing as medicine then certainly we are not allowing those people s genes to expire  This isn t true for every case as i said for instance certain serious developmental disorders would not procreate even now and as such would not pass on there genes but still  Treating the symptoms of deadly hereditary disorders keeps those genes in the gene pool 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Whether we like it or not by keeping people alive we are subverting natural selection  Wrong Natural selection is an ongoing process in the human species We  aren t subverting anything The fact that we are born live breed and then die means there is natural selection  some could make an argument for artificial selection in society but I would disagree  We have evolved  to have a large intelligence language history high learning capability These things came from natural selection so we aren t subverting natural selection in the least bit    gt But what do you guys think is there a way to fix it without becoming eugenicists  You only ask this question because you don t understand natural selection We don t need to do anything 
PoliticalDiscussion,Humans inventing discovering technology is the natural course of events Our evolution will proceed within the environment we create for ourselves There is no subversion happening 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you are wondering if it would be constitutional I think it would  I think it will be a long time before government involvement in health care ever passes either the senate or the house again 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think historical analysis of gun ownership strongly disagrees with you So strong that I don t honestly think anyone really believes that I think you would be better off debating a constitutional amendment but you probably aren t able to change the topic so I d say you are screwed unless your opponent sucks or your judge is super liberal 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think you re completely misunderstanding natural selection 
PoliticalDiscussion,I believe you are saying the government would purchase private insurance plans and then have some of distribution method If this is what your saying then the constitutionality would be a lot less in question then the current mandate I believe Justice Scalia would agree that this is constitutional as long as the taxes put on the people were constitutional I m assuming just the income tax would be used or maybe a payroll tax I would think it is unconstitutional but I think the supreme court would say it is constitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the reason no one voted was because the government was no longer recognized as legitimate I doubt that the  government could command any power 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Hell read the first word of the st Amendment  Congress shall make no law   Already covered that   those are  specific amendments  Others don t have that at all 
PoliticalDiscussion,States were allowed to do all those things when the Constitution was first written Hell read the first word of the st Amendment  Congress shall make no law  Not  The governments that make up these United States  but  Congress  The  only reason that this is not allowed now is the th Amendment specifically the due process clause which states   N or shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law      Prior to the  s the Bill of Rights   did not apply to the States   See   Barron v Baltimore     gt The question thus presented is we think of great importance but not of much difficulty The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves for their own government and not for the government of the individual states Each state established a constitution for itself and in that constitution provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular government as its judgment dictated The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed best adapted to their situation and best calculated to promote their interests The powers they conferred on this government were to be exercised by itself and the limitations on power if expressed in general terms are naturally and we think necessarily applicable to the government created by the instrument They are limitations of power granted in the instrument itself not of distinct governments framed by different persons and for different purposes  The rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights were very slowly held to be against the States in addition to being held against the federal government throughout the last  years The nd Amendment did not apply to the States until     McDonald v Chicago   though arguably this was laid out in  Heller   That decision only makes sense if you take the nd Amendment to be about self defense rather than about protecting State power which as I ve said is a counter historical reading of the nd Amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,How do you feel about the discovery of agriculture pushing back the eventual rise of the ubermensch   
PoliticalDiscussion,Nice to meet you Mitt Romney 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t miss Adam Kokesh in person 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m reminded of the senator who said the American people would be shocked if they knew how many of the laws passed over the last decade are interpreted The government has declined to answer the request for their interpretation 
PoliticalDiscussion,That I can agree with you on 
PoliticalDiscussion,My objection  I don t have an objection  I want the individual mandate to stand  That said I m not the one who gets to decide on its constitutionality  That s up to the Supreme Court which has become a political institution as opposed to a judicial one 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the logic follows I agree that the Federal Gov t cannot restrict rights but then that means the States can  It makes no sense  Does it mean States can have established religions  They can suppress free speech and regulate the press  That the state militia can put people in my house but not the Federal gov t  I mean that is all technically plausible under your interpretation  Which also means that the Bill of Rights is effectively useless  In all honesty it s my belief that all non specific Amendments  meaning those which don t mention  the Congress  are intended to protect us against interference by all levels of Gov t  
PoliticalDiscussion,I ll have to ask my teacher if I m arguing with regards to policy or the constitution Although the agree but still contradict strategy can be incredibly risky 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Yes because if he decided to deny care the situation you just described would be illegal thanks to the Emergency Medical Treatment Act If you receive medicare funding  which virtually all hospitals do you must provide that care Therefore hospitals must pay for care for the needy   Great   so you agree that the owner of the hospital is the one being coerced into providing care for the needy Thus the doctor s oath has nothing to do with it    gt You have still yet to explain how you justify your example that vets and doctors are the exact same thing  I never said they were the exact same thing The OP said that because doctors have some ingrained need to help people that hospitals must provide that help to the needy Vets have the SAME NEED TO HELP ANIMALS and thus using that logic vet clinics should help animals fee of charge You really should pay attention this is rd or th time i have spelled it out for you    gt Also please do not use r atheism as a source That is like using r politics for political news   I didn t  I just said you should go there to learn a little something about how absolutely wrong you are    gt It s obvious we re not going to make any headway  Next time pay close attention 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right  it s a necessity to a free State But if that s the justification for the federal government not being allowed to make laws restricting guns then you can t use that same argument to prohibit the States from making gun control laws Meaning that a State is free to make whatever laws it wants about guns and gun ownership is not an individual universal right The only way that you could incorporate the nd Amendment via the th Amendment is if it was always about individuals from the start rather than protection of the States from the federal government Which is why people have to claim that the nd Amendment referred specifically to self defense as a universal right which is pretty clearly not the intent of the Amendment nor what was true of the States at the time of ratification  I don t have anything against guns and I think the federal government is prohibited from making gun control laws by the nd but I have no idea how anyone can honestly say that a law designed to help protect the sovereignty of the States actually means that the federal government has  more power over how the States conduct their business 
PoliticalDiscussion,I didn t ask about the GOP I asked about  you  We re talking constitutionality here  per my title  which is obviously your objection to my original option  You stated it was exactly the same and therefore not okay So I m trying to figure out what you think is okay constitutionally speaking of course 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Lets make this super cut and dry for you so the argument does not slip by you again  gt Imagine you yes you  not a doctor  own a for profit clinic You hire one doctor and two nurses You buy a lot of equipment and all that fun stuff  gt Now some homeless man comes into the clinic seeking help with a broken toe Remember  you own the clinic and are not a doctor so no oath Since doctor is paid by you by the hour and is not being asked to work off the clock or anything WHO is being forced to pay for something Is it the doctor who is getting paid regardless and spending no money of his own onneedles or bandages Is it the owner of the clinic who never signed any oaths to provide care to the needy  Yes because if he decided to deny care the situation you just described would be illegal thanks to the  Emergency Medical Treatment Act   If you receive medicare funding  which virtually all hospitals do you must provide that care Therefore hospitals must pay for care for the needy   You have still yet to explain how you justify your example that vets and doctors are the exact same thing  which was if I m not mistaken your original point  Their obligations are different when you said they were the same That is how this entire thing got started You are defending different positions again and again while thinking they are the same That was why I brought up the oath you seem to miss that  Also please do not use r atheism as a source That is like using r politics for political news   It s obvious we re not going to make any headway and this has already turned a bit ugly which was not my original intent 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How s this no credit You okay with that  No because it removes the incentive for the uninsured to buy insurance  The GOP wouldn t be ok with it because its a new tax 
PoliticalDiscussion,End result is not the same as the means  But to your question yes  How s this no credit  You okay with that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Soo   the end result is exactly the same  Either you buy insurance or pay a penalty in the form of higher taxes  yeah I thought so 
PoliticalDiscussion,If the Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate then the bill is broken and there is no fixing it  They may try to strike down the mandate while keeping some other provisions but it ll be maimed beyond repair 
PoliticalDiscussion,No my proposal is tax them and if they decide to buy insurance give them a credit  A silly differentiation but apparently okay 
PoliticalDiscussion,Again that is EXACTLY how the individual mandate works  It s not really a mandate  It says buy insurance or pay a tax penalty  Just like your proposal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How on earth is it as cut and dry as that You can t just say  it s cut and dry and poof it s a simple solution  I provided the original question and the answer given to that question That answer contained reasoning   gt I can t vouch for him I can only call you out on a poor comparison between vets and doctors  It is a valid comparison given the context of the argument    gt Hospitals   you mean those things filled with doctors  YES     since   hospitals  are not signing oaths those oaths cannot be used to require   hospitals  to pay for care to the needy   How is that so hard for you to grasp   gt A sick person comes in and the doctors who work there are put in direct odds between their oath and hospital policy correct  They are not If they want to honor your interpretation of the oath then they can pay for the supplies    gt A hospital doesn t need to enact a policy that all of its members already hold on their own  Lets make this super cut and dry for you so the argument does not slip by you again   Imagine you yes you  not a doctor  own a for profit clinic You hire one doctor and two nurses You buy a lot of equipment and all that fun stuff   Now some homeless man comes into the clinic seeking help with a broken toe Remember  you own the clinic and are not a doctor so no oath Since doctor is paid by you by the hour and is not being asked to work off the clock or anything WHO is being forced to pay for something Is it the doctor who is getting paid regardless and spending no money of his own on needles or bandages Is it the owner of the clinic who never signed any oaths to provide care to the needy   gt That little bit at the end doesn t serve much purpose either by the way My sincere apologies for actually trying to get you to defend a position   A If you don t know why atheists don t have to prove the non existence of god i suggest you hop on over to  r athiesm  r athiesm for a better understanding   B I have been defending my position over and over again you just can t seem to grasp it 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it s pretty dumb to throw away  pages of legal text  But that s just me  Let s continue wasting taxpayer money and adding to government waste instead of fixing a  solution  Genius 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s not rephrasing it s giving the person an option  without getting a fine  One they would be stupid to turn down yes but an option that does not force them to buy insurance  If you want to go down the road of  they are still getting fined  then I send you back to the right of congress to tax  And every other tax  in our society  Did you know you are getting  fined for the library you don t use 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody in Congress wants to fight this stupid battle again  the best hope for affordable universal healthcare is if individual states can craft successful single payer plans prompting others to follow suit  Vermont will probably be the first 
PoliticalDiscussion,IT doesn t change the fact that congress forced people to buy guns Also guns are not static they require care training and supplies all of which came at the expense of the individual 
PoliticalDiscussion,Unfortunately you have an uphill battle up a combination of snow and motor oil  The nd Amendment was worded fairly specifically regardless of what any naysayer believes  Remember the goal is the preservation of a  free state  the vehicle to do so is the  militias  and the right to support this is to  keep and bear arms   Also note if the founding fathers purely intended to mean that only states are allowed this right they would have mentioned this no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not in this instance the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed   this is intended to support the concept of having a militia and it s necessity to a free state  
PoliticalDiscussion,The Supreme Court got quite a few laughs yesterday when they were discussing Congress ability to easily salvage the existing legislation 
PoliticalDiscussion,Personally  I don t support selective service believing that beyond the constitution people have an inherent right to liberty and have no social obligation to give their lives to the society they exist within  That said the constitution is quite clear that congress has the power to raise an army  Article one section   The Supreme court has ruled that this power overrides any concerns regarding the legality of selective services I don t agree with it but this is because I don t agree with the constitution I acknowledge the intrepretation  The government defends the individual mandate via the commerce clause NOT the general welfare clause You are quite astute that they might have a  marginally stronger case if they had used this as their defense I suspect they would still lose 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m socialist so no I don t vote And Obama isn t a socialist he s FAR from it a real socialist will know that Its all an illusion guys Sorry 
PoliticalDiscussion,You ve got to be kidding Do you truly feel that a choice between two people either for president senator house governor or even county clerk is going to REPRESENT you and your true thoughts and beliefs If you re okay with wars debt lack of education and other problems in our country that have accumulated over the last  years isn t the elected officials fault or those chosen had  no real power then keep believing your  vote matters There hasn t been any  change for a century Illusion of choice my friend It s an illness   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The key to understanding federal power is that unless the power to do something is not specifically granted within the constitution then its reserved for the states or the people  So shouldn t we be pointing to where the constitution specifically allows for forcible draft instead of a court case And also wasn t the issue of Rostker v Goldberg mainly centered around whether women should be required to file for selective service   As I understand the constitution allows for congress to provide for both the defense and well being of the nation 
PoliticalDiscussion,they ve sold out LOOOOOONNNGGG before even running for office 
PoliticalDiscussion,But imagine if we took that   billion and put it towards something else Like developing other sources of renewable energy that is produced all in house  America  This creates jobs and will be more beneficial in the long run when the price of oil goes up even more  If you dont want to put the money into other energy sources why not our infrastructure Redesigning the electric network redesigning the transportation system A whole host of different American systems that deserve funding in my opinion over the exploration of new oil fields
PoliticalDiscussion,The operative case is Rostker v Goldberg  U S    where the Court has ruled that congress has wide constitutionally granted powers to raise an Army   The ACA   specifically the individual mandate seeks to force people to buy a product service under the commerce clause of the constitution This is allegedly  hopefully will be found to be unconstitutional because inaction does not constitute participation in a market   a key requirement for the commerce clause to be in effect   The key to understanding federal power is that unless the power to do something is not specifically granted within the constitution then its reserved for the states or the people Checks and balances 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bush Gore   But seriously to look at a modern issue of voter fraud just look at all the issues currently taking place in Maine It s not like there haven t been voting issues throughout all of human history the current American system isn t without  potential corruption To think so would be naive  Personally I m also just not a huge fan of the electoral college I think the institution in and of itself is deceptive since the representatives don t even have to vote based on their state districts actual results Now if those initial results were skewed the potential influence in the electoral college is unknowable There s too many variables domino effect to have any kind of definitive response So no I can t back it up It s all just conspiracy speculation  
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think war is inevitable It is an election year in all  countries and the war drums will have died down a year from now   Does anyone else think a nuclear Iran isn t that big of a big problem We have lived with a nuclear armed North Korea for  years now Iran doesn t even have the capability to attack the US They  might be able to get a bomb to Israel but they wouldn t dare bomb them Israel has way more nukes and a better air force than Iran Israel wouldn t even need American help to destroy Iran Iran would need to be either stupid or suicidal to actually use a nuclear weapon They want the bomb as a deterrent to other military forces in the region   Israel Pakistan India Russia and the US all have nuclear weapons Iran wants to sit at the big boys table 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t focus on my description of monkeys too much   but focus on the concept that people don t always play by some set of rules which govern human society  The problem in Egypt is that those who are secular and want freedom liberty are not as organized have less arms  power  and lack the will to compromise on their ideals for a better future  That s why they will lose because in order to get what they want they have to do things they are not willing to do   which means fighting dirty and taking the gloves off  It s why most revolutions always end up with some despot espousing some authoritarian responsibility  It s why Stalin beat Trotsky why Mao dominated Chiang Kai Shek and how fascists took power in Italy and Germany  The Arab Spring was a success but in it s wake only questions remain  
PoliticalDiscussion,Just wondering can you back that up 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are absolutely correct People quite simply don t understand sampling or statistics I see  they only asked  people or  they didn t ask me comments by people who insist that therefore the poll is obviously wrong  It s infuriating 
PoliticalDiscussion,The subsidies in question are designed specifically to promote new oil and gas exploration  It s a tax write off for money spent on the exploration and development of new oil fields  Does this tax credit actually affect the global price of oil  Probably not  The US doesn t produce enough to significantly affect prices  But it does encourage drilling which is important if we ever want to stop paying hundreds of billions of dollars to brutal governments in the middle east   We re talking about   billion in lost tax revenues due to these subsidies  It s a decent chunk of change but rather small in the grand scheme of things  Whether we offer a tax break for exploration or just open up more federal land to drilling the result is the same less reliance on overseas oil more jobs and a lower trade deficit  All of these things are good for the country 
PoliticalDiscussion,The US has military installations in all of  these   countries They have Iran surrounded The can also send a carrier group to the Persian Gulf 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the majority Reddit cares far more about denigrating Christians than is does about a child s life  Sad but o so true 
PoliticalDiscussion,Reminds me of Super Tuesday when Romney was receiving the majority of the evangelical vote over Santotun according to the Mississippi exits  Anyone with a brain knew there was something very off about that   I too hate the emphasis on polling numbers favorables unfavorables policy barometers etc  Any question and outcome can be phrased to support whatever cause the poll is trying to prove 
PoliticalDiscussion,If you wouldn t mind me adding some more to this The whole concept of having  positive and  negative genetic variations is a subjective idea It is in respect to the environment that the organism exists in which defines the organisms subjective interpretation of good and bad traits  Also another way to explain the benefits of a more diverse population are  at least one individual organism from a species has a higher probability of surviving anything from disease disorder to environmental chaos  the higher diversity amongst intra species fornication produces even more diversity in their genetic make up increasing the probability for new kind of genetic recombinations producing newer forms of the species  increasing probability of adaptability   So genetic diversity is a natural mechanism of nature to produce more varying forms to accommodate the changing environments For no organism exists forever always changing That change is genetic diversity   Now in regards to medicine helping people who would without medicine not exist It is simple The particular environment in which that organism exists has methods of sustaining life even with a terrible set of genes That environment has sustained this organism and as we all know environments change So if this person cannot adapt then extinction is the only option Its not a matter of good and bad these are simple subjective interpretations A more correctly worded question would be is this particular trait in my genes a benefit to my survival in the current environment  Then again I m not an specialist in evolution So really I m just trying to explain from my perspective about the topic Please correct me if I am wrong  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt There is no obvious solution It s just something that frustrates and amuses me  I agree to no end Although I m going to have to tag on something to your reasons behind why people do this They are lazy It takes effort to look up this information I dont do it unless I m truly involved in the issue and care about the information that is being presented I dont think it should be on the people to look up this information and wade through the spins that are put on data Yet thats the world we live in and no complaining about it is going to change the ideas that we have grown up with and are ingrained in our society  In my opinion the only way to combat such nasty data reporting is to not believe anything you hear Any sort of statistic percentage poll any form of collecting a consensus opinion on a subject should not be held at face value When you hear someone talk about a subject and they cite some data to prove their point the only thing that should come to mind is that  jeez thats an interesting topic they are talking about I wonder what there is to learn about it  The things you hear shouldnt be your source of information   you  should be your own source of information Granted this means actually knowing how to accomplish this and having the tools at your disposal to accomplish this But in my opinion unless you have gathered beyond a reasonable doubt based on creditable sources that any statement should be held true you should regard any piece of information that you hear subject to falsehood  TL DR  People should more readily think critically about what they hear As well as use what they hear as a instance of provocation of thought rather than a basis on which to form an opinion
PoliticalDiscussion,green party libertarian party 
PoliticalDiscussion,Don t you think there are examples after examples of how we are no longer just a bunch of fucking monkeys I mean don t get me wrong there are also examples after examples of how we are still monkeys I just think it takes a lot more than our primitive monkey characteristics to do something as intellectually sophisticated as having a revolution  although I am making the assumption that a  revolution is a complex idea which involves more than a monkey s brain nonetheless I could be wrong  Also their are more examples of us not acting like monkeys then acting like monkeys I mean we wouldn t be where we re at if that wasn t the case Albeit one could say it is merely the overall monkey behaviour but with more sophisticated tools

PoliticalDiscussion,People have been making death threats against one another for a long time  Whether they got together on a facebook page or a church or a bar to form the mob and make the threats is irrelevant  Threats of violence are clearly defined by law  The NFL thing while seemingly less serious  injuries rather than death isn t entirely trivial because it appears to involve a large scale conspiracy   I will pay you  x to go over and break that person s leg constitutes conspiracy to commit a crime  It means that coaches managers owners lots of people could be implicated  Anyone that knew about it might be charged    However it happens on the football field  Playing football carries risks and players consent to those risks when they play  If a player knows someone will try to tackle them and knows being tackled can cause serious injury and they consent to playing anyway they accept the risk and no one will be arrested if someone gets hurt    Telling a player  I want you to tackle the QB is part of the strategy of the game  Saying  I will give you  x if you tackle the QB is just adding incentive no more illegal than paying him to play in the first place    The possible crime comes in when they say  I want you to tackle so and so and make sure you break his neck   How far does the player s consent go  If you consent to the risk of being tackled do you also consent to the risk that someone will try to break your neck    Lots of questions that are not clearly settled in law

PoliticalDiscussion,It would seem I misunderstood your point   Your question is about whether it is  right for the senate to hold a hearing about the seemingly trivial NFL bounty case but not the death threats  In that case the law already covers death threats and an agency already exists to handle such issues  Why do they need to meet and discuss settled law  The NFL bounty issue is new  No law clearly addresses the case of intentionally targeting a person for injury when the person is willingly participating in an activity where such injuries are considered part of the game  On the one hand injuries are a part of the game and players willingly walk onto the field  On the other hand intentionally seeking to do excessive harm is a crime regardless of where it happens  So it is appropriate for the senate to meet and discuss what actions do and do not constitute a crime here and what the penalties should be

PoliticalDiscussion,Well I kind of thought it was a funny one liner 
PoliticalDiscussion,Keep in mind in this brief discussion of Scalia s premise in Heller I will mostly be looking at the language of the Second Amendment  up to a point it s a long opinion   and will extend some ideas from the first part of my reply above Again this is a mix of notes I dug up and edited down for reddit and some things I wrote now so I apologize if it s in coherent   Scalia starts by discussing the strange language  as does anyone who mentions this Amendment since it is awkward and outdated  He says there is a prefatory clause   A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State  and an operative clause   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed   and says that the former does not limit the latter OK   He turns to the clause that does most of the lifting the operative clause and begins with the  Right of the People  The problem here is that he doesn t mention the public distinction of  the people with the private capacity of  persons  even though he says it  unambiguously refers to all members of the political community  As above the republic worked differently in the  th century and not all persons in the US were members of the political community notably women who had private rights of persons but not public rights of the people  and did not have to serve accordingly  He also makes the  collective rights distinction  which I think is a modern conflation above but I will grant him this  but is incorrect in referring to the militia as a subset of  the people  he militia  was  the people    Then notion that  bearing arms has something other than a military way in context of the Second Amendment is just disingenuous cheeky nonsense Scalia offers historical definitions and concludes that  arms is completely synonymous with  weapons  the two are wholly interchangeable He admits however that there is an idiomatic military meaning but only in very limited sense using  against  even though one of the definitions he uses distinguishes  arms  as opposed to  weapons  to  instruments of offence  generally made use of in war  and then concludes it absurd to even consider that the idiom is present  because the use of  generally somehow categorically excludes  arms implying a military context unless of course one uses  against   Do I bear arms when I brandish a hunting rifle Sure I can kill someone with it but that does not magically make it  bearing arms  I can also kill someone with my firsts or beat them to death with the Sunday New York Times  as Carlin once pointed out  but people would look at me strangely if I claimed to  bear arms in anything but a metaphorical sense  Here is the view from a judge in early th century Tennessee considering the phrase  bear arms    gt The phrase has a military sense sense and no other A man in pursuit of deer elk an buffaloes might carry his rifle every day for forty years and yet it would never be said of him that he had borne arms much less could it be said that a private citizen bears arms because he has a dirk or pistol concealed under his clothes or a spear in a cane   Aymette v State   Tenn  Hump          This is the first case in which any court grapples with the notion of  bearing arms  and the judges conclude that carrying weaponry is very distinct from  bearing arms  and the second case in which the constitutionality of carrying weaponry is challenged at all  True this has to do with the Tennessee constitution and not the US although the judge discusses the latter and the purposes and intent behind the Second Amendment explicitly Not only does he refer to it as a  public political right  but explicitly denies the  private individual defense argument It is worth noting that the earlier case I referenced taking place in Kentucky withheld unequivocal possession of weapons and struct down a law limiting concealed weapons However this was the language used there  that the right of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state shall not be questioned   Bliss v Commonwealth   Ky  Litt    Am Dec       which is rather stronger and more explicitly individualist with its language   Taking a closer look at the definitions Scalia offers one defines arms as  weapons of offence or armour of defense  as opposed to merely weapons or armor I can use any tool  for an offensive purposes again another thereby using this tool as a weapon  including my fists or a kitchen knife  but it is strictly a weapon   of offence  And this also ignores the whole juxtaposition with  armour  specifically  of defence   and I can t think of any context where people are outfitting themselves with tools for the purposes of offense and defense that is not at least on some level a military one  or the simulation thereof  or criminal  The one definition of  arms he invokes that says what he wishes is still ambiguous  any thing that a man wears for his defence or takes into his hands or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another  But this language is rather flowery and has the troublesome complications especially if I want to get as persnickety and technical with language as Scalia is  e g  so do the  or  s exclude something that can strike another from as defensive item what is within whole  in wrath qualifier Do I  bear arms when I throw a rock at someone   It also still has this offense defensive juxtaposition that he ignores Even if I give it to him it still seems that  bear arms is often a militaristic turn of phrase It doesn t mean that people can t extend it elsewhere  metaphorically  but that this it seems rarer I realize this splitting hairs is rather obnoxious but I m only doing it because that s the way Scalia wants to play   In context the whole statement  to keep and bear arms is sandwiched between something unambiguously military   A well regulated militia   and the Third Amendment about troop quartering  also unambiguously military Why would the Framers throw a private right in the midst of discussion of military matters Especially consider the phrase  bear arms  only appears in similar military contexts in the contemporaneous State constitutions But Scalia the famous originalist  ignores a lot of apropos context especially of how it  tends to be used then insults his way through any and all objections  as Scalia tends to do     What bothers me so much about the Scalia opinion it s predicated on making on what is essentially a stawman He offers a very narrow linguistic and semantic argument dresses it up in technical language like  prefatory and  operative clause  while simultaneously appealing to use  distinguished from technical meaning   but is actually diverting attention from a stronger simpler semantic argument regarding context Language is and was especially before global communication descriptive To claim this phrase was never  ever used in other contexts is asinine  but no one actually claims that It s like defending someone who bought the animal when they were  told to buy a  new mouse at the store because the old one broke This person would be technically correct but also a dense fool and would be ridiculed rightly Let s not pat ourselves on the back and congratulate what is actually gross semantic misunderstanding If someone want to go shooting with a friend no one is going to say  let s bear arms tomorrow at noon  or ask  hey keep and bear my arms for me I gotta take take dump  Sure the friend would understand what this means but it s clunky and would probably elicit some joke response along the lines of  I m not gonna hold your hand while you shit  Again it s awkward Part of the argument involves separating keep and bear  such that even if bearing arms had a military sense  keep breaks the idiom But Scalia says the term is  not prevalent  and even though some State constitutions used this language in the context of regulating militias because  keep has more general uses his conclusion is that the context doesn t matter So even though both  keep arms and  bear arms both were used in context of discussing militias in all the documents of the time this means nothing Now that is  grotesque  We say context matters in law As the great William Blackstone noted  Words are generally to be understood in their usual and most known signification not so much regarding the propriety of grammar as their general and popular use   Commentaries     If someone hears you say  I want to kill that guy  and then you do you can t argue that it wasn t premeditated because this is a benign common idiom that people use all the time while that is true you did kill the guy  well actually it depends on the state but that s my point context matters  It s ridiculous to suggest otherwise   Another thing to note before concluding is that Scalia himself says that  Like most rights the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited  Great I don t think anyone but a small fraction of people want to completely limit firearms so isn t that what the big disagreement is about What those limits should be The perspective I m offering is that the Second Amendment is not really applicable unless we contort its words and meaning Militias are gone The republican democracy ideal has also transformed into a more liberal interpretation as voting privileges have been decoupled from their associated duties into the realm of quotationless rights But let s stop with the unlimited  right to bear arms founding fathers drum beating and have a serious discussion of the pros and cons and other minutiae of guns without appeals to anachronistic authority and give weapon rights their proper  st century context 
PoliticalDiscussion,haha you are so mad right now make me laugh some more I order you to

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Thanks for the laugh  I know what you are saying   gt but I think your grammar needs more work than your framing  In what respect charlie 
PoliticalDiscussion,It isn t about the scale of the crime it s about jurisdiction  A single death and whether it was murder manslaughter or self defense is governed only by state law  Unless the issue somehow crosses state lines then the federal government doesn t have the right to interfere  The NFL bounties issue was not limited to any one state  Teams would cross state lines to play against each other  There is no way to say that the crime occurred in Michigan or Florida for example because it extended everywhere the NFL players went  Thus no single state has jurisdiction and the matter must be handled at a federal level  
PoliticalDiscussion,Thanks for the laugh kid but I think your grammar needs more work than your framing

PoliticalDiscussion,The problem with forced unions is that they force people to join them That is not voluntary which is probably unconstitutional  though I am not positive   The first amendment only gives the right to peacefully assemble Being forced into the assembly  unions is not peaceful and as such seems like the government is forcing you to break the first amendment I don t really know That may be a stretch  Voluntary unions would lose significant power however it gives the choice of the worker of whether or not they join which is good 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt let us assume that people in great pain are less likely to reproduce  Why would you make that assumption 
PoliticalDiscussion,The idea comes from the federalist ideology in the Constitution States are supposed to be their own independently stable geographic areas The federal government is there to ensure that all the states are capable of working together efficiently To do that they need to have power over how the states interact with each other A person coming from another state into yours is still an interaction between  states because the other person has been subject to different laws and environmental and financial conditions all from the fact that the other state is supposed to independently support its citizens 
PoliticalDiscussion,Really Please elaborate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well yes and no You are not forced to be in a union to work in a specific profession but in specific jobs yes In a profession with a very high level of union membership  like auto manufacturing it becomes de fact that if you wnat to work there you have to belong to a union Also the union doesn t approve or disapprove If you are hired by the company the union can t say no to your membership   but you do have to belong to the union in a union shop   Having looked at right to work states there does seem to be a pretty high correlation between being a poorer state with higher reliance on social programs and being a right to state That of course does not imply causation as I can see being a poorer state being a driver towards right to work legislation and it isn t universal 
PoliticalDiscussion,Here in Britain we do not have a leader who we vote in The Prime Minister is simply the leader of the party who has the majority in the House of Commons It seems to work reasonably well So the leader would effectively be the person who commands the highest number of votes in your House of Representatives

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Over the short term sure but I think we can objectively say the long term health problems of eating McDonald s every day are negative   The question is whether the costs outweigh the benefits not that there are costs We know there are costs There are costs to everything    gt People don t live in a vacuum like that so unless you find it morally acceptable to let people go without medical care their decisions will have an adverse effect on the rest of society   Now you re changing the entire argument You went from  people do stuff against their best interests  to  people sometimes do things against their long term interests  to  I disapprove of people doing things where they can enjoy the benefits while imposing the costs on other people   I agree with the last part but unfortunately you actually don t   This is   yet another  problem with welfare statism If the government is paying for your health care then the government should control factors that substantially affect your health There s no getting around it    gt so unless you find it morally acceptable to let people go without medical care   Like you for instance By world standards you are relatively rich You could donate your money to people who need food or medical attention but you don t I guess you find it morally acceptable to keep the money for yourself and let them do without 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt When I hear a friend tell me he s going to check out the new  MRI machines just for kicks or when heart surgeries offer a  bring a buddy for the same price deal I will agree that health care is no different from VW Beetles or gym memberships  So because it is something that people don t  check out for recreation free market principles don t apply to it That makes no sense Are you listening to what you are typing You are grasping at straws and it is sounding more and more ridiculous each time you try to reply  If people had to pay for an MRI out of their own health savings account then when they needed one  in those cases where they have the time to chose where to go  they would call around and see how much it costs at each location The location with the best price would get the customer and those that overcharged would lose customers forcing them to drive down prices to compete This would cause the overall cost of an MRI to go down even for those that don t have the time to search around for the best deal  i e those in emergencies  The same thing for heart surgeries prescriptions or anything else 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is the million dollar question Do you have a better idea for a political system As long as people have their TV trucks and general feeling of safety there is not much reason to change anything

PoliticalDiscussion,Well the survey from the Suffolk University is a pretty crappy survey because their method allows for no statistical comparison within questions  This is due to the fact that their survey uses a closed end nominal structure the participant picks either A B C or D and when summed X picked A Y picked B and so forth is the only within factors  in this case question analysis you can perform    Had they used questions that required a rating using a Likert scale for example then they would generate variance because the question generates ordinal data not nominal  If they had done that then we could cross compare the rated  trust for the various commentators to see if one is actually significantly seen as being more trustworthy than another because now we have a mean and a std deviation from the data  One note I mentioned they could not perform within factor or in this case question comparisons but they could do between factors analysis i e  the rate at which Republics or Democrats watch say Fox News versus CNN support Obama versus Romney et cetera and calculate the odds ratio that given a participant answers this how much more like would they then respond a particular way to another question  There also may be some non parametric analysis that could be performed but I m not overly familiar with many of these methods so I ll leave that for someone else to discuss 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They value the taste of food and the pleasure of eating lots of calories over being slim  Over the short term sure but I think we can objectively say the long term health problems of eating McDonald s every day are negative It s not as simple as aesthetics versus taste Even if you do say hypertension diabetes and other medical risks are a net neutral for that person it s certainly not for the society as a whole People don t live in a vacuum like that so unless you find it morally acceptable to let people go without medical care their decisions will have an adverse effect on the rest of society   I think all the things I ve listed can be listed as objectively bad especially if you take a long term view of them

PoliticalDiscussion, gt Look at the obesity rate in this country and tell me people make decisions that benefit them  They value the taste of food and the pleasure of eating lots of calories over being slim    gt But don t imply people will always choose the best option  You are simply substituting your own personal values as what s  best  
PoliticalDiscussion,You are supposed to learn proper attribution of quotes in like th grade How old are you 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Health care is not a consumer item in the same ballpark as what people normally think of as consumer items  It is The reason healthcare costs are so high is because people believe what you just said and don t treat it with the same logic they treat all the other industries whose costs are going down 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Car insurance companies drop customers for being high risk every day  Not after a car has been totaled which is the analogy to what you stated  that they drop you when you get expensive  
PoliticalDiscussion,socialism  Our government should print it s own money Fuck the Fed 
PoliticalDiscussion,YEEEEAAAAAAIIIIIOOOOORRRRR     
PoliticalDiscussion,So once the company is a union company they are not allowed to hire non union people Seems like they are tying their hands and not allowing them to hire the best employees but the ones who the union approves  It seems like what you are saying there are forced unions If you want to work at a company that is unionize you are required to join a union or get a different job 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correct I m assuming the Selective Service would go under  to raise and support the armed forces in Article  Section  of Constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,they don t want the same things they want very different things there are separate groups of people  far more numerous than  parties who want extremely different ways of living life and being governed and having an economy  they dont want the same things at all what would make you think such a naive thing mix more with people not like you you will be stunned 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very good point To add to that  because I have heard this mentioned a lot on political talk shows recently the Supreme Court has no interest in solving the healthcare issue nor do they take into consideration what striking down this law will do to the current healthcare system The Supreme Court is deciding if the ACA is in conflict with any other existing federal laws or legal president and if the legislative branch has the authority to enact this law To the Supreme Court the actual healthcare system is one of the most irrelevant issues in the discussion 
PoliticalDiscussion,How old are you He probably doesn t like the payment system however it is set up Like less monies 
PoliticalDiscussion,The AHCAA had a lot of provisions but mainly people are focused on   individual mandate  expansion of medicaid eligibility limits to  of the poverty level  subsidy to low and middle income people to help buy insurance  But the bill also included a bunch of consumer protections like   creating minimal standards for healthcare plans  removed the maximum life time benefit payout limit  repealed the anti trust exemption for insurance companies  prevents insurors from denying coverage due to a pre existing condition  allows children up to the age of  to remain on a family insurance plan  helped to close the coverage gap in Medicare Part D drug plan created by the Medicare drug reform law passed by GW Bush  Then there are provisions with more questionable roles like   the central health insurance exchange  insurance premiums can increase by no more than  a year  limiting the contribution to flexible spending accounts to  per year  Those consumer protection parts were the major increase to cost expanding medicaid providing subsidies and possibly closing the  donut hole in Medicare Part D will be the parts that cost us  However I ve heard several times that AHCAA was designed to fail on purpose  Closing the coverage gap in medicare part d was a huge concession to the elderly as it reduces their out of pocket yearly expenses for all the drugs they take  If AHCAA gets repealed then the Democrats can validly say  Republicans are driving up your costs and attacking your Medicare   And lets face it Romney has to win Florida to become president  Moreover the idea behind the  planned failure of AHCAA was to help pass another bill with a Public Option  Of course I don t really buy that looking at Open Secrets the pharm industry was spending on congressmen and lobbyist back in  and  like it was a major election year  They don t want to compete with a public option because it will be a game changer in how they do business  And I honestly think that support for a public option wasn t that strong among the democrats in congress 
PoliticalDiscussion,People do stuff against their best interest all the time    People smoke go into credit card debt get married to someone who is psychotic Look at the obesity rate in this country and tell me people make decisions that benefit them If you don t think the government should force people to act within their long term interest that s fine but don t imply people will always choose the best option 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Supreme Court are not lawmakers They do not ever decide what freedoms people are to have All they have the ability to do is apply the law from the legislation to individual cases Securing freedom for the US people is not in their job description nor should it be because they aren t elected officials  If you honestly want to blame someone blame the drafters of the Constitution They are the ones who put it there It may not be explicit but you would be hard pressed to find any Supreme Court justice in existence that would interpret  The Congress shall have Power To raise and support Armies as meaning that they cannot select people for service 
PoliticalDiscussion,Correct me if I m wrong but if the ACA gets struck down it will likely be because of the individual mandate being an overreach of the federal government to regulate commerce  according to SCOTUS  The selective service is not commerce so they are two separate things   
PoliticalDiscussion,I m glad you ve realized that you aren t very smart but it s funny that you still managed throw in one more inaccurate and irrelevant statement for good measure 
PoliticalDiscussion,The reason for that  is because they are white collar   Anyways I was simply responding to the above assertion that union jobs are generally blue collar by providing a counter example 
PoliticalDiscussion,I was simply responding to the comment 
PoliticalDiscussion,This is a nice compromise I believe that generally speaking fairly accounts for both parties rights 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bingo We have an answer I was doing some rotation s at a psychology ward in Chicago and my attending physician was constantly complaining about the patients Mainly because when you have a psychological disorder  that includes addiction and you are poor You re basically fucked Literally It was honestly disgusting how we were treating these patients   Now I m not saying we were beating them or anything along these lines But the way you treat an individual who is addicted to a substance is not treating them for their immediate condition  Over dosing  but that is all we do We get them back to a physiological state which is  normal and then throw them back on to the streets within a week That is not how you deal with addicts This does nothing for them They might of as well died from the OD The reason this is the case is that these insurance companies don t pay jack shit They really are a devil wearing prada  It s not your doctors fault He would have such a large amount of patients if he took just patients on those insurance plans and he wouldn t be getting paid a fair amount of money for his services I mean my attending was explaining how Medicaid pays him  a patient every month for a year s worth of cover That is  year for a patient who can come as many times as they want to see you That is ridiculous  I mean i m just saying what I learned from my rotations I still don t personally fully understand the U S health care systems  medicaid   medicare  
PoliticalDiscussion,It is a failure of Government price setting It has never worked well and you are finding out what history has already told us yet Government apologists ignore 
PoliticalDiscussion,lol I was focusing too much on the monkeys What are these things that the liberal s don t want to do I mean what would be a questionable tactic which would help them gain power 
PoliticalDiscussion,I doubt it lost  most cultural ties to ancient Egypt Also I wouldn t just say Islam alone did that When Christianity came and the orthodox pope was in power he also asked for the burning of the library of Alexandria   So these fucked up religions tried to destroy the ancient Egypt That is because they knew it was a better way for Egypt Like you are saying they don t want the competition and they did everything they could to stop it Even though those actions are disgusting and corrupt in nature  Although in the culture many of those ancient characteristics are still prevalent Such as the saying my father says Furthermore Islam has only been in power for   of the history of Egypt It is a small amount when compared to the length of previous reigns This is what I mean when I say Egypt is not an Islamic country or a Christian one either Egyptian s themselves are of no religion For they are merely forced into them from invaders   I hate how people  think Mubarak was an example of secularism He wasn t even close He was a manipulative leader who puts factions of the Egyptian populations against each other He created division amongst the population in order to distract them from him To be honest though I don t think the particular president in power is of greater concern than the institutions which give him power The SCAF are the real problem They are the power who are stopping Egypt from becoming a powerhouse While the brotherhood and salafis are fools The country is in some of the worst economic situation in its entire history and the dumb witted shmucks are worried about porn I mean these people really think that if they change the moral landscape of Egypt that everything else will change with it What a bunch of horse shit   By the way Thanks for posting 
PoliticalDiscussion,That works out great as the evidence recently released shows Zimmerman miraculously uninjured as he is being taken by the police from the squad car into the station 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but not OK for healthy people to forcibly purchase insurance that benefits them  If it benefited them you wouldn t need a law forcing them to do it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It appears from my insurance and Part B benefit statements that participation in their networks requires doctors and hospitals to agree to discounted charges Likely Medicare Part B and private insurances are increasing these required discounts That would explain doctors bailing out of those network agreements 
PoliticalDiscussion,OK just letting any experts out there have first say if they want 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please feel free to do that Here I pursue the political interest in our health system 
PoliticalDiscussion,As you can see this post was made  days ago At that time MSNBC published an article citing all of the facts here None of my information came from Fox News   If anything the fact that  days later a ton of new evidence has come out and is changing the narrative again goes to show that everyone  and if your tone is any indication especially people like you should continue to keep an open mind and wait until all the evidence comes out   Clearly though you ve made up your mind days or weeks ago I m  sure you get all of your opinions from very credible news sources and you make sure to read material from sources with liberal and conservative biases in order to remain grounded   I think having a discussion on politics philosophy or even something as trivial as a movie would be like trying to talk to a wall 
PoliticalDiscussion,All of your information is based on untruths No witnesses coraborate Zimmerman s tale The lead Detective wanted to make the arrest because he did not believe Zimmerman Now that the ABC video has been released you can see that Zimmerman has zero evidence of injuries Your entire post is just FAUX News bullshit 
PoliticalDiscussion,You need to read  What s the matter with Kansas  
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes because you are simply to smart for me and I want so very much to have a long in depth conversation with someone so wonderful and gracious and kind   Really   And the fact that I have to legally have an ID just to walk outside my home in the state of Florida means nothing No Nothing compares to health care not a single thing because you are so smart and nothing that anyone says will EVER EVER come close to anything you say Ever   
PoliticalDiscussion,You re generalizing   Creation of Selective Service and ACA mandate deal with two different Constitutional powers 
PoliticalDiscussion,Medicare open to all Americans  Let s roll it out and stop with this comprimise bullshit 
PoliticalDiscussion,You pay for other people s healthcare now  The dirty non secret in America is that EVERYONE is guaranteed health care right now  We have laws in this state that makes it illegal for someone to walk into the ER and be refused assistance or for an ambulance to drive by a person that cannot pay for it  So who pays for this  Why the insurance companies and health professionals that push that cost onto their customers  The idea behind the Republican crafted concept of mandates is that by requiring everyone to buy insurance you logically now cover everyone for healthcare   which is actually something that America does right now This is a cost saving private enterprise approach    An altruistic alternative is expand Medicare to all Americans  That is a real single payer liberal idea  What Obamacare is is a conservative idea that forces people to buy insurance for something they DO need and will eventually use even if they don t think it  Mandates are just used to spread cost and makes the insurance companies happy because it is still profit driven 
PoliticalDiscussion,I support universal healthcare for the same reason I support public education public utilities or  the federal highway system   at a certain point in a society s evolution healthcare becomes an essential service necessary for social and political stability  my cite any civ game    I support universal health care because I believe the data shows that a healthy population is more productive than a non healthy one the same way an educated population drives faster GDP growth At the margins you will always have people who are rarely sick or who were born with debilitating high care illness   but its pointless to try to set policy which is  effecient and in aggregate I believe universal health care for a society is a hallmark of progress the same way clean water is currently considered   That said I nevertheless strongly object to the individual mandate and moreover do not believe it to be true that this is the only way to fund a universal healthcare bill  Separately I do not agree with the premise that the ACA is a universal healthcare bill  What congress has done  with the aid of the executive is implemented a healthcare bill whose source of funding comes from forcing people to buy a private service   They could just as easily  and constitutionally have passed a tax similar to medicaid medicare or a tax credit similar to the home mortgage deduction and libertarian leaning people like myself would have had no constitutional power grab objections  
PoliticalDiscussion,Psychology  Politicians play to a certain segment of the public in order to win a race  It is easier to win a majority if you can make the case you are quite different from the other individual running for the job 
PoliticalDiscussion,You are right Rostker v Goldberg did center around that but that doesn t mean it doesn t have implications in other cases For instance while the Roe v Wade decision dealt primarily with abortion the opinion contained an entire section dedicated to the notion of personhood that undoubtedly would factor into a yet to be appealed court case regarding OK s personhood at conception law 
PoliticalDiscussion,VOTE FOR NONE OF THE ABOVE you can probably write it in 
PoliticalDiscussion,The mandate doesn t  allow healthy Americans to pay into a pool It requires that you do or you pay a tax penalty   There is a legitimate argument that for society as a whole high health care costs are a bad thing that can have multiplicative effects Even without Obamacare taxpayers still end up footing the bill for poorer individuals who can t afford health care By making it more affordable for them these individuals don t have to sacrifice whatever capital or assets that they have in order to stay alive At the end of the day if it comes down to paying for cancer treatment or paying a mortgage bill an individual will most likely opt to pay for their cancer treatment and risk foreclosure on their house Now their house is foreclosed they probably sell off everything they own in a panic they re in debt up to their eye balls   and guess what They still become the burden of the taxpayer when they have to go on welfare unemployment etc  Those are my thoughts on the matter I do agree it s a bit naive to think that health care is an unlimited resource but the current system has many problems with it Obamacare is flawed but at least it is ernest and legitimate attempt to fix a serious problem in this country 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m seeing a lot of this in  r PoliticalDiscussion  r PoliticalDiscussion lately Over reaching analogies  You take something like the ACA decision over generalize it   failing to complete an action   and then apply it to whatever you want  Stop it  Just because you can make an analogy between two things doesn t mean that your analogy proves anything about those things  I m not just trying to pick on OP here I see this all over this subreddit 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is pretty hard for laypeople believe that even a sample of a few hundred or thousand  assuming it s representative and properly collected  can be statistically valid I don t blame them It s complicated stuff that s not really easy to explain unless you took stats in high school or college or whatever 
PoliticalDiscussion,Excellent question 
PoliticalDiscussion,People should But they don t I consider myself pretty skeptical I do have my biases and prejudices but I believe I at least make a concerted effort to get to the truth and I m not afraid to confront something that might contradict what I previously believed   I really attribute my views on this to an intro psychology methods lab when I was in college We spent the majority of the time looking at methodologies figuring out how to get representative samples how to call bullshit when news articles cite studies and so on It made a big impact on me 
PoliticalDiscussion,The healthcare mandate has nothing to do with the congressional power to raise an army The two powers are separate and have different scopes 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Any question and outcome can be phrased to support whatever cause the poll is trying to prove  Here is a fantastic example of this    The Problem With Polls About Whether Obama is a Muslim   The Atlantic    
PoliticalDiscussion,Because Commies Dirty dirty commies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Why does the government need to encourage drilling   It seems like the encouragement to drill oil should be  the profit received from selling oil  It s not like these companies are charitable organizations   
PoliticalDiscussion,I m not sure what the point of comparing to another industry would be  If we spend twice as much as other countries but only  percent of that money is spent on innovation it seems like it would invalidate the  The US pays more because we fund R D theory We pay for R D but they also make more money off of us 
PoliticalDiscussion,Money totalitarianism power grabbing etc are missing the point  The real reason is because of an emergent phenomenon caused by our majoritarian electoral system  In this winner takes all system it is necessary to prove that your party has the best course of action to solve our country s needs in order to get elected instead of allowing that other guy to get elected  But because these problems have non intuitive solutions it is just  easier to say  you re wrong  instead of explaining how your nuanced and indirect methods will lead to that ultimate goal  Just watch Fox news  you ll see how they villanize anyone who disagrees with them because it legitimizes Fox s unsubstantiated beliefs to their viewers  Those viewers then go out and vote in favor of the politicians without explicit policy positions  which is always non explicit  because they don t have a working policy  they only have a working mudslinging media machine   And this goes both ways  Democrats are just as guilty of this tactic as republicans  Any new party that displaces the democrats or republicans will by necessity have to do the same  This is the problem with a majoritarian election system  IT MUST BE FIXED 
PoliticalDiscussion,The justification tends to be that adversarial politics allows the deficiencies in proposed legislation to be identified The idea goes that if politics is a big circlejerk then laws that sound good will be passed without proper vetting  The trouble though is that  when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you  Opposition parties are so used to looking for flaws that they tend to be all that they can see Perceived deficiencies will  always remain in a law when it comes up for voting on and it s hard not to overstate the significance of those flaws when your job is to find them  Essentially finding problems with the other party s laws is helpful but voting against the other party s laws isn t necessarily It s easy to get confused  Another strange point is that the transparency of negotiations combined with the national focus encourages the radicalisation of politics Because of the focus of the news and the ridiculous amount of polling that goes on politics essentially turns into bouts of point scoring  Blocking an opponent s legislation is a  victory for your team Being  forced to compromise is a loss Ridiculing an opponent in a catchy soundbite might give you a jump in the polls though it could set back actual collaborative lawmaking  Real progress tends to occur behind closed doors in private meetings where politicians are free to give and take without the rhetoric demanded by the news cycle 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thing is you don t have to join a union  there is actually no such thing as a forced union there are simply employers who can t hire non union members Every factory every business every service always has the right not to hire union   but then they can t hire any union members You can hire non union carpenters but if you do no union carpenters will work on your site Once a union gets into your business  and remember the employees have to vote to unionize you can t get rid of the union members because the union does have some special protection However if you can find a non union auto plant  I don t think there are any in the US but I m really not sure you can work there as a non union member No union member can work there without giving up union membership If the plant workers then vote to unionize the plant becomes a union shop  I didn t realize this wasn t common knowledge 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s what I m saying  The naysayers point to exploitation in third world factories the low pay and pollution  But if the alternative is starvation and intractable poverty it s still an improvement  Or at least a step in the right direction  Globalization contrary to what its opponents say actually helps spread the wealth around the world 
PoliticalDiscussion,Old conservatism the conservatism of Burk Disraeli and even the Federalists had its origin in the ideological defense of the aristocracy The idea was that a patriarchal aristocracy and elite upper class could take care of the people listening to them but not heeding to populism in a gradual manner Europe s aristocracy also had power by birth not by competition and thus were less likely to pander to businesses than elected leaders They imagined a society where the government looked after their people but was not necessarily run by said people The Federalists obviously scratched the bit about aristocracy but still disliked the idea of proper democracy In many ways the corporatism that prevails today can be blamed on measures put in place in the name of democracy Super PACs and corporate news networks gain power by broadcasting their views to voters creating groups like the Tea Party The conservatives of old would scoff at such populism 
PoliticalDiscussion,One can make an argument for some form of patriarchal aristocracy  a class of privileged elites with political and social standing Aristocrats generally eschewed business and thus would be less likely to pander to corporations They also don t follow populist movements However it would be constitutional so they couldn t do whatever they wanted Imagine something like the United Kingdom except the House of Lords retains its hereditary peerage and is more powerful 
PoliticalDiscussion,The Bush tax cuts are also far less important than what many people believe I think they should be repealed but repealing them won t do much 
PoliticalDiscussion,Crime is way lower than it used to be The recession is bad but the US will recover in the coming few years The rich poor gap is bad but it isn t that much worse than it was  years ago  we are talking about small percentages here Basically the sensationalist idea that the boomers wrecked America is just that  sensationalist BS 
PoliticalDiscussion,  WATCH OUT GUYS  
PoliticalDiscussion,Thank you for posting this Globalization isn t perfect but it is the best thing to happen to humanity in a long time 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is Outsourcing is demonized in America by those who claim that they are taking our jobs and by those who have bleeding hearts about the conditions of said job takers But outsourcing has lead to massive improvements in the nations that gain business 
PoliticalDiscussion,What form of liberalism Economic liberalism That s been perverted by corporatism Social liberalism It s struggling but slowly winning Political liberalism I m not too sure on that last one  the Democratic party isn t strictly liberal especially compared with European left wing parties but Reddit liberals are often more left wing than said European parties 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s really sad that you are too stupid to understand my point  We haven t even gotten to the point where we are discussing the pros and cons of single payer health insurance run by the government    We re still stuck discussing why your attempt to compare insurance required at a the state level to operate a piece of equipment to insurance required at the federal level because you exist is not persuasive in any way  Once you understand that maybe we can discuss other topics but I don t think that s going to happen 
PoliticalDiscussion,Eisenhower represented an older era of republicans a party that still had much in common with their Whig ancestors They were definitely conservative  had a dislike of populism hawkish in foreign policy etc  but they also recognized that being pro business does not mean following corporate lobbyists blindly They felt that the government had a role to play in improving the economy through infrastructure  Ike gave his name to our interstate system  and through laws that made sure that every American had a chance to participate in the economy That is true capitalism The corporatism today is the death of capitalism 
PoliticalDiscussion,Even without corporations we would have a duopoly That is the natural outcome of a first past the post voting system 
PoliticalDiscussion,You don t have to vote for one of those two Vote green vote socialist vote communist vote libertarian vote anybody else People bitch about the two party system and then either vote for one of those parties or don t vote Like you 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yeah and playing around with the idea of  innocent until proven guilty too much could set a bad precedent for future laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,Two wrongs don t make a right We base justice off of evidence not off of hypotheticals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Reddit s not libertarian There are a ton of libertarians but even more liberals 
PoliticalDiscussion,Conservatives of  years ago are quite different from the conservatives of today George HW Bush would be considered a RINO 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well said troll can t vote in every single state 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think anybody is that afraid of OWS If OWS gets off of their bums and actually does some political organizing like the Tea Party did  they are vile but were somewhat effective then they would be afraid As long as OWS stays confined to Twitter and drum circles nobody cares 
PoliticalDiscussion,We already put billions into the development of renewable energy sources  Renewables receive orders of magnitude more subsidies than the oil and gas industry when measuring on a per Watt pasis    Renewables and infrastructure are both valuable investments for our country  I support the funding of both  But the economy is still in the shitter and gas prices are once again rising precipitously  The US has the largest amount of fossil fuel reserves in the world  It s time we develop those resources 
PoliticalDiscussion,Cops and soldiers vote If nobody votes we are assuming that the police and military are just as disillusioned 
PoliticalDiscussion,State electors determine the president They could continue to do so if nobody votes at least I think so  I am no expert on the electoral college  
PoliticalDiscussion,Oil companies don t control oil prices Oil is a global commodity and its price is determined by the global markets In fact corporations don t control most of the world s oil State controlled oil companies do  see the linked graph  Prices are determined trade and speculation speculation fueled by the status of these public and private corporations So why do we give them tax breaks Simple they lobby for them  
PoliticalDiscussion,Invasion is not inevitable In fact invasion is very unlikely At the most  war would involve Israeli jets with the possible support of the US Air Force bombing some targets in Iran to which Iran would respond with ineffective arial counterattacks and saber rattling Invasion is incredibly unlikely at least in the short run 
PoliticalDiscussion,Egypt is an Arab nation It lost most cultural ties to ancient Egypt when Islam took over just like how Macedonia today has more in common with other Slavic nations than it does with the empire of Alexander  Nevertheless the ancient Egyptians lasted for thousands of years and Egypt today can learn from them You are completely correct The best Egypt would be a secular Egypt However Mubarak held that same view Mubarak was a staunch defender of secularism and a staunch opponent of Islamism Yes he did use Islamists as tools when he needed to but he kept them out of power As a result the Islamic groups  the Brotherhood and the Salafis  were able to become the dominant anti Mubarak organizations winning support from those who opposed the regime And with his fall they have emerged as the most organized group only beaten by the secular but unpopular army generals As the generals loose power those who will benefit the most are the Islamists Egypt s seculars must hope that the Brotherhood stays true to its word its promise to act in a moderate manner More than hope they must keep constant pressure on the Brotherhood to maintain its moderate beliefs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Voting was established to persuade the people their collective opinions mattered These candidates don t represent any of my beliefs  huge pacifist  hurt our country and way of life year after year It s terrible  
PoliticalDiscussion,No it s because congress under Bush II mandated that Medicare is barred from negotiating lower prices The VA is allowed to negotiate Their costs are  lower 
PoliticalDiscussion,Alright I see what you re getting at then I guess the administration messed up then if they re trying to push it as a penalty instead of a tax But I feel this isn t like some kind of fundamental problem with the law It seems to me it could just be reworded to increase medicare taxes by  dollars and everybody who gets insurance gets a  dollar tax break 
PoliticalDiscussion,I m going to quote this bit to show you have no idea what you are talking about and try to help you from there   gt The mandate allows for healthy americans  i e me to pay into a  pool per se in order to pay for the less fortunate to access quality healthcare  The mandate is absolutely nothing of the sort There is a fundamental flaw in the US health care market which is that you can choose not have health insurance when you are healthy and thus avoid paying like a thousand dollars each year and then jump on a group plan when you get sick and need a   surgery Obviously this is not sustainable The premise of insurance is that everyone pays a small amount and for the few people who have costly sick events the pooled amount from everyone pays for them But if you can avoid paying into the pool until you are sick and just need to withdraw money from the pool obviously the pool is going to run out of money Which brings us to   gt So reddit please tell me why I should support paying for other people s healthcare when I have paid over   in healthcare premiums in the past  years and have been to the doctor for a check up  You pay for other people s healthcare because that is the   entire fucking premise of insurance   You pay in a small amount each year and if something catastrophic happens the insurance will pay out way more in your medical cost than you ever paid in But guess what when those free loaders who aren t paying into the system all of a sudden join your health plan at work because they have developed a brain tumor they are sucking millions of dollars out of the pool when they never paid into it And guess what fixes that   The fucking individual mandate   it s just so frustrating to see you get all upset about subsidizing free loaders when what the individual mandate does is  fix that   All the mandate would do is force the  of the non elderly population who does not currently pay for insurance to pay for insurance since they will inevitably join a plan when they get sick and get care that they never paid for anyways  Every other country in the world deals with this problem but we haven t And it s costing us We have the most expensive health care with some of the worst health outcomes  Almost every other country deals with this problem by either requiring people carry health insurance coverage or providing it through the government  You are completely missing the forest for the trees by thinking that the mandate has something to do with providing coverage for poor people The mandate has something to do with keeping the entire health insurance market solvent  Which they need to do because if it s not  and trust me that it s really not  the only other option is to enact a public insurance system  tl dr While the individual mandate might not be constitutional it is absolutely the only way to run a health insurance market Ask any economist or health policy professional ever 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I believe that many import aspects of The Affordable Care act are overlooked I mean for example I m  years old and a college Freshman on   small scholarships but I still have to work  hours a week to pay for food and living expenses  Now thanks to Obamacare I can stay on my parents insurance for a little while longer so that I m not drowning in student debt while drowning in medical bills as well I mean my dad was in the Air Force so I graduated in Germany and many people go around yelling about socialism and how America doesn t need to be like Europe  Let me tell you something I lived there for  years and have visited more countries than most people do in a lifetime  We need to be more like Europe our healthcare system is embarrassing and the debate about it is silly when you go to any other modern country in the world

PoliticalDiscussion,Every generation is going to have people who blames the previous generation for society ills  And likewise that generation is going to get uppity when the newer generation blames them for problems  Try not to take it so personally     Regarding Protests    One of the problems with comparing the protests between Vietnam War and something like the Iraq war is the existence of the draft  During Vietnam many people who opposed the war many men were  forced  to go into a war they didn t agree with   Wars today are fought by volunteers  Humans get more emotionally involved with something when it involves the idea of them getting  murdered for a cause they don t believe in   This is why you didn t see those same  baby boomers protesting the Iraq War too   This combined with the news coverage of Vietnam showing dead bodies and the current censoring of war leaves the average civilian more detached     The Boomer Leaders   If anything I find the Boomer generation to have a lack of great leaders Many confuse people like John F Kennedy with the baby boomers He fought in WW People like Kennedy Martin Luther King Jr  Mother Teresa etc were the previous generation  Considering how many baby boomers were born there should be  Kennedys  Martin Luther Kings  Mother teresa etc  Current baby boomer leaders  Bill Clinton George W Bush Newt Gingrich Rick Perry etc  feel like pale comparisons to the leaders in our past     Regarding Power   Wealth    You are right The rich poor gap has existed for centuries  What frustrates me is policies of past administrations that screw over future generations in order to keep the current economy strong Just kick the can down the road and let them handle the problem  With national debt levels at ridiculous levels things like reaganomics the robbing of social security putting dictators in control  to keep gas prices down  it presents an enormous problems for my generation  And yet our leaders are still not doing anything about it  While baby boomers are not directly responsible for this they have elected the leaders that allow this to continue  The baby boomer generation may irritate me in some ways but I gladly recognize they have also done   a  lot   of good My parents were baby boomers and I hope to be as good of a parent as they were to me   TL DR  I blame my generation for having this term even existing  We all have faults   hindsight is    
PoliticalDiscussion,Where did I say invasion is inevitable 
PoliticalDiscussion,I certainly agree  nor do I think the OP s analogy is tenable in anyway  but the latter is hardly unprecedented despite claims to the contrary  The Miltia Act of  mandated almost all citizens to privately purchase muskets ammunition bayonets even pouches and a knapsack among other things This bill was signed by George Washington  Surely it forces people to both purchase supplies or otherwise engage in commerce 
PoliticalDiscussion,they argue it is just a tax to fund their plans When the bill was being debated the penalty was never called a tax People specifically said it wasn t a tax When the bill became legislation nothing in it said that the penalty was a tax and for all intent and purposes it is a penalty Obama s lawyer just argued in the supreme court that it wasn t a tax this week It is not a tax It is a penalty for not obeying a mandate from the federal government That is all it is Feel free to try and work it any way you want but that isn t the case 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt No they can not argue that   What do you mean It s a government program Government programs cost money to run and oversee The official projection is the act will cost  billion dollars over the decade The money has to come from somewhere  So you can either pay your share one of two ways Purchase insurance so you stay healthy and limit your financial burden to government Medicare programs Or you pay  dollars It seems like a pretty fair distribution to me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just remember When seconds matter the police are just minutes away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really  The arab spring was caused by a hike in food prices Thats pretty primal 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Why does anyone support universal healthcare other than feeling altruistic  Is this not a good enough reason itself This entire debate has been centered around freedom vs altruism  Why should I pay for X  has been met by  Because it s the right thing to do    Perhaps the better question would be  Why shouldn t you pay for X  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt People make emotional decisions and then rationalize them  Then so do politicians and bureaucrats You know the people you want to override individual decisions   Or are politicians and bureaucrats superior to us in this way   gt You are justifying what is clearly a poor decision from rational perspective  It isn t a  poor decision  You personally make decisions all the time where you trade off a little health for a little pleasure There is nothing irrational about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,It is important to understand that the individual mandate is a concession to the insurance companies in return for forcing them to accept individuals with preexisting conditions and  community rating   Insurance companies can t survive doing either without a larger pool   So it is either a single payer government system  Medicaid for everyone or the individual mandate   Furthermore to your point about paying for other people s health care expenses that is something that you are already doing 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well the point is that states have a constitutional obligation to give other states acts full faith and credit See Article IV Section    gt Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof  The problem is where to define the limits of this I think that drivers licences and marriage licences are really indistinguishable in a legal sense I have thought long and hard as to whether I believe this should carry over to CCW permits which are on the surface very similar 
PoliticalDiscussion,I haven t gotten the time to read all of the transcripts But thanks for pointing that out Though I don t actually buy it  seems to go against simple supply and demand  Still doesn t change the fact that the mandate being struck down would be a HUGE change in precedent   
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Now I am a  year old male who has a good job and can afford my families healthcare expenses etc  This sentence is loaded with enormous assumptions most of which are just artifacts of an ignorance of statistics  What you ought to say is that you think that you can afford to pay the mean cost of health care but you are ignoring variance and intend to pass the buck onto society if your kids get leukemia or some other rare but expensive and life threatening illness   gt Note  I am a huge supporter of the pre existing condition part of Obama s plan but I realize this isn t possible without most of the bill  What do you propose  
PoliticalDiscussion,You really should read the transcripts   they mention several markets where failure to participate increases the prices Electric Automobiles was mentioned by Clement in his explanation that any market which relies on scale has its price affected by non participation  If the commerce clause is to have any limitation on federal power the mandate has to be struck down  
PoliticalDiscussion,Well I d assume the state makes the decision on what to allow Washington Oregon Idaho and Utah all have an agreement that a conceal carry permit from one state is valid in all states Same way Washington and Idaho share instate tuition between each other 
PoliticalDiscussion,This needs to be what the conversation is about The focus on the unfairness to the haves of making healthcare coverage universal is ridiculous for the excellent reasons that wetkarma so lucidly outlined  Like access to quality education access to health care should be guaranteed in a truly modern society  The real conversation needs to be about the manner that a government achieves that and I agree that forcing the population to access universal coverage through a sector  insurance that is well known for its corruption and bad faith policies is beyond the pale 
PoliticalDiscussion,A strike down on the individual mandate would go against decades of precedents which would be huge And that is exactly why I don t see it happening   The health care market is vastly different Name a different market where not participating in it  not buying insurance actually raises prices for everyone else   For me I m actually interested with the ruling on the expansion of medicaid 
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree with you on the electoral college and the fraud in the Maine primaries and  election isn t unlikely but most conspiracy theories are bullshit in my opinion 
PoliticalDiscussion,He s wondering where to draw the line on state governments giving full faith and credit a constitutional term to certain items issued by other states For example driver s licences and  heterosexual marriage licences from New York are recognized in Ohio Ohio concealed carry permits however are not recognized in New York  
PoliticalDiscussion,And this is where the politics within the Court itself come into play As Chief Justice Roberts can decide who writes the decision if he is on the winning side So if it is clear that Kennedy will be in favor of same sex marriage Roberts could also rule in favor just so he can write the winning decision in a way that softens how much of win it is for same sex couples  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt whereas healthcare legislation does not  Actually it includes a religious conscience exemption which ought to apply to some groups  Christian Scientists come to mind   Not identical but I thought you might find that interesting   gt   RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION  Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section  d    H of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof described in section  g   and an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section 
PoliticalDiscussion,He would be proposing a federal law because he is a member of the US senate and that s where he does his legislating   gt No state is required to abide by any other state s laws  While this is strictly true states do have to honor contracts formed under the laws of other states which means that they usually have to acknowledge the laws of other states to at least a certain degree  It is defined in the  full faith and credit clause of the constitution 
PoliticalDiscussion,He will go to trial he will be acquitted and then effectively he will spend the rest of his life with a literal target on his back  
PoliticalDiscussion,Just to get more specific there are actually two major cases going on right now  One is Perry vs Brown  formerly Schwarzenegger  aka  The prop  case   This is the most well known case  It is about whether the federal constitution compels California to allow same sex marriages  In this case the plaintiffs wish to marry but are being prevented  As this case is challenging a state law on federal grounds it could be decided in any number of ways some would potentially affect other states others would only affect California  The other case Gill vs Office of Personnel Management concerns a woman who is already married  to a woman  suing because she is being denied spousal health care benefits under the Defense of Marriage act  As this case is challenging federal law whoever ultimately wins it affects the whole country 
PoliticalDiscussion,The  paying for other people s health care part comes from the expansion of Medicaid under this plan not from the mandate   gt So reddit please tell me why I should support paying for other people s healthcare when I have paid over   in healthcare premiums in the past  years and have been to the doctor for a check up  Part of the reason you pay so much is that many young people don t get insured and thus the pool of people insured is disproportionately made up of old and or unhealthy people who have  correctly estimated that they are fairly likely to need health care in the near future The goal of the mandate  not that it will necessarily get there is to reduce premiums for everyone by making private insurance pools more representative of society 
PoliticalDiscussion, One million plus at the march against War in Iraq and this was in the UK so that s like  million easy in the US   
PoliticalDiscussion,I agree The point in pitting one generation or demographic against another is keeping people from looking into the laws the power structures and the politics that really matter    Divide et impera  divide and rule The concept is as old as civilization 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Did we buy into the  American dream of property ownership and a comfortable retirement Of course and you have too  You assume that we expect that we ll be able to retire at all  As for me I ve bought into the dreams of paying off my student loans 
PoliticalDiscussion,  m As the others have mentioned I don t think your measuring stick of  of protesters over x amount of years is appropriate This was directly related to the draft We have no draft for our current wars and public and media engagement have been minor Additionally perhaps one of your gifts to us is to demonstrate just how ineffectual protests are Why would our generation bother with a failed tactic Your defense of  show me  and then come back to complain demonstrates that you are trapped in old thinking and so criticism from our generation doesn t make sense to you It seems that our only recourse is through the polls and yet the boomers truly let down the nation and continue to do so with its choice of politicians  Perhaps we are more judgmental to the boomers but to whom much is given much is expected Your generation has managed the deconstruction of the greatest economic and scientific powerhouse of all time into the laughing stock of industrialized countries Your generation came of age with the moon landing and yet you are now willing to de fund the public sector so billionaires and millionaires can have tax breaks  Your generation s complete rejection of Carter s goals of energy independence and avoidance of external military conflict led to the Reagan era of which we are still entrapped   In Reagan s  reelection he won  states the strongest electoral mandate in modern times Reagan completely disregarded energy independence and worker protections He wholeheartedly endorsed the war on drugs prison growth supply side economics cuts in the safety net for the poor and spent billions more on the military all leading to a tripling of the national debt And yet those in the baby boomer generation supported him in higher numbers than the so called  greatest generation Reagan with the support of the boomers started the trajectory we are still on which is one of growing prison populations obscene military spending and adventurism CIA and NSA over reach tax cuts for the rich limitation or reduction in support for the poor rejection of science promotion of religion in public life and a promotion of xenophobia and distrust of other nations This was the time for your generation to rise up but instead you either shrugged or heartily believed that the ends justified the means   I find it telling that what you hold up as the boomers finest hour most likely had more to do with self preservation than any valiant character trait You should have spent more time protesting or voting against terrible politicians ruining our country Our current politicians are primarily boomers and they are mostly terrible Boomers and those older still vote more than the younger but there will come a time when the younger take our place in choosing our political leaders   We are more progressive we are more educated we are more connected and we won t give up like the boomers We understand the long game Our tactics are not as visible and we often keep our beliefs quiet but this does not mean that we don t have plans to change this nation  The boomers should hope that we do not fail this nation like they did 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed 
PoliticalDiscussion,You already have insurance so therefore you dont need to pay into anything Why dont you read the actual bill before creating an uninformed opinion and spreading it So many people are of this mindset you re also already paying for other people s medical care your taxes go to medicare which is universal healthcare for retirement aged citizens  There are huge huge associated costs to society in general and city state funds when they re having to pay for emergency situations for people in dire need of health care but who have waited until the last minute to receive care out of fear of going to the doctor without an insurance plan Preventative care is far far better than reactive and millions of people do not benefit from this 
PoliticalDiscussion,The is just a stream of consciousness and I m not sure what you are getting at Do we want a society where laws can only be changed on a national level No Do we want a society where the people have a greater say in the laws where they live Yes So what is wrong with states rights I m just confused at what you are getting at here 
PoliticalDiscussion,I am unfamiliar with the bill being proposed by Mark Begich but I really don t have to be The answer is if it is a state law he is proposing for Alaska no other state is required to abide by it If he is proposing a federal law then it will never get passed  No state is required to abide by any other state s laws 
PoliticalDiscussion,Twist words however you want A penalty is not a tax The constitution does not authorize the federal government to mandate citizens to purchase things from third parties Also the penalty is just to persuade you to purchase the insurance     gt Couldn t they just argue that it costs money to support this program  No they can not argue that    gt by not participating you re increasing the government s financial burden  How That isn t even the governments argument The governments argument is that there are free riders in the system that increase healthcare costs for other people because they force emergency rooms to take everyone Looking at the bill though it isn t even trying to solve this problem though It s not a tax and it isn t constitutional 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt If it benefited them you wouldn t need a law forcing them to do it   gt You are simply substituting your own personal values as what s  best   You are rationalizing people making decisions as a rational benefit directed process It s not People make emotional decisions and then  rationalize them  Nobody in their right mind would  choose to get diabetes and yet the aggregate result of thousands of decisions is resulting in an epidemic of cases of a disease that is pretty awful Early death a decline in quality of life possible amputations  And you re hand waving at what is  clearly a bad decision as  they value the taste and pleasure  more   You are justifying what is clearly a poor decision from rational perspective  We are not the finely tuned reason machines  rational choice theory thinks we are 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They do not ever decide what freedoms people are to have  Roe v Wade  
PoliticalDiscussion,In the nineties Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act which says that states do not have to honor other state s same sex marriages But with a Californian case on the issue heading towards the Supreme Court there is a decent chance that there will be some big changes in the country regarding same sex marriage I wonder if Justice Kennedy how much sway he has in shaping the nation s future right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s right but think about why states taxing each other is a bad thing You want to promote a highly organized interconnected system If you allow states to tax goods from other states there is less incentive to work together and more to just do everything your own way But some states are just inherently better at other things due to natural resources or what have you You want every state to be able to equally take advantage of every other state 
PoliticalDiscussion,I ve been reading the transcripts of the case as they get published and while oral arguments aren t prescriptive I d wager serious cash that the individual mandate will get struck down   The transcripts are well worth reading and attorney clement lays out the case as to why if we grant the government power to force citizens make a purchase in insurance there is nothing stopping the government from doing the same thing in other markets For me any good benefits from the ACA are massively outweighed by this dangerous interpretation of the commerce clause 
PoliticalDiscussion,I always thought the federal control over  interstate commerce was to prevent states from taxing each other for goods ie new yard adding a tax to southern cotton etc  So this power keeps the states from acting like independent nations taxing each other etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean   does it really increase their power even more than now anstromm had a good point a mandate is only considered a  mandate because of the consequences for not following it Right now it s a  dollar penalty but it s not like you get a fine in the mail it s all done through your taxes You just get  less dollars in your tax refund Couldn t they just argue that it costs money to support this program and by not participating you re increasing the government s financial burden and thus this amount allieves it I don t see what s unconstitutional about that 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think that EntroperZero s comment above nicely compromises between the two tensions 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a shame that you re being downvoted because you re making a fair point   I don t cast the blame on the baby boomers for the current state of affairs in the US Mostly I think the attitude from my generation  I am a  year old grad student BTW comes from this feeling that we re not being considered in the circumstances we ve been handed It is frustrating to hear condescending remarks toward our generation about how shitty we are We are products of our environment     The following statements are not necessarily what I believe but rather the perspectives that my generation hold College is more expensive than ever  but it was the baby boomers telling us we needed to go to college in order to be successful So more and more kids are going to college ultimately making a college degree not as valuable as it once was It s our generation that will be paying off our massive federal debt because your generation has a stranglehold on its massive entitlements like social security medicare etc We ve been told that if we work hard then we will find success  but finding a job out of college is harder than it s ever been We re experiencing the same crisis of confidence in the system that your generation faced in the s I remember not comprehending how George W Bush could have won the  election if he did not have the popular vote That sort of shattered this idealistic view of American democracy that had been preached to us since we were small children    wars the worst economic recession in recent history    certainly those things are NOT my generation s fault   But alas Every generation inherits the problems that the generation before it created And every generation will create problems for future generations to deal with That s just how things work    And many of the problems we are facing can be traced back longer than any living generation   
PoliticalDiscussion,Or failing to fill out their tax returns 
PoliticalDiscussion,Specifically I was reading this editorial    gt Under a bill sponsored by Senator Mark Begich Democrat of Alaska you could take your Florida permit and your Florida loaded handgun and travel anyplace in the country including the states where the police investigate every permit application and say yes to relatively few  If this law existed today George Zimmerman could carry a loaded hidden handgun in Times Square Today  said Dan Gross the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  gt And that would be the moderate version  gt Senators John Thune of South Dakota and David Vitter of Louisiana have a competing bill that would relieve residents of states like Vermont and Arizona  which don t require concealed weapons permits at all  from the cumbersome process of actually putting in some paperwork before they tote their handguns to say California or New Jersey Under this one Jared Loughner who shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords a judge a small child and four other innocent Arizonans could have brought his loaded handgun to Times Square 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think it will be found constitutional Everyone at some point participates in the health care market Lack of insurance and visiting ER for medical care causes prices to rise for other customers I find the  inaction argument to be BS   I d say ACA mandate will be upheld pretty unanimously  or    would be disastrous  with the majority opinion explaining about how different the health care market is compared to other markets which will be the argument for the limiting factor   But then again I m not a lawyer so I could be totally wrong    
PoliticalDiscussion,Acquiesced is far too mild a term Your generation as a whole seems to have gone from one extreme to the other You once marched in the streets to demonstrate for freedom and justice now you are the ones so concerned with your safety  and that of your precious children you champion anything to increase your physical moral and financial security at the cost of our freedoms and future Please do not construe this as an attack on you as an individual rather as a indictment of your generation as a whole 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The mandate allows for healthy americans  i e me to pay into a  pool per se in order to pay for the less fortunate to access quality healthcare  No  It requires the that the uninsured buy insurance or pay a penalty  Low income earners will have their insurance premiums subsidized on a sliding scale  With a mandate the young healthy uninsured will balance out the old sick uninsured and the ones who can pay for insurance will help balance out those who need subsidies  But without the mandate the young healthy and well off uninsured opt out leaving a pool of old poor and or sick uninsurable people  People who have insurance  such as yourself are exempt from having to pay into any pool since YOU ALREADY HAVE INSURANCE 
PoliticalDiscussion,To add to what you said people with poor or no health coverage won t seek preventative care and routine checkups where something might be caught and treated easily and inexpensively They ll tend to wait until they have no choice but to seek medical attention By then any treatment will likely have become costly invasive and or debilitating in the long term  Also we do pay for the bills of the under insured right now Wonder why that MRI cost your insurance company    Because hospitals know what insurance companies will pay and they need to squeeze them for every cent to cover costs they ve had to eat from treatments to uninsured and bankrupt patients In turn insurance companies jack up premiums and co pays to cover their losses 
PoliticalDiscussion,Please elaborate on what gun laws you are referring to as I am unaware of any one state s gun laws that other states are required to abide by without their consent 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt what would be different in terms of individual impact if this mandate was a tax instead of a mandate To me it seems like the only thing that would change would be the procedures involved but in the end result there would be no difference for the person  You have to remember that healthcare is not a government run program To create a tax to collect money to pay a private entity for a service that people use at will is a far larger political hurdle to jump then the ACA The simple answer is a  health reform act goes over much better than  a new tax to pay for people who can t afford healthcare even though theoretically both end with the same result 
PoliticalDiscussion,Bingo Right on the money The survey itself is crappy But no one is going to know that unless a they actually look at it and b understand how surveys of this sort ought to be conducted 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Requiring people to pay for insurance doesn t magically wipe out the cost of care that they would receive by walking into an ER without a penny in their pocket  This might be true if the uninsured kept using the ER just as they did before they had insurance What is hoped by the authors of the law is that once you have these people insured they can start using the primary care system they have been excluded from until now  By going to see a primary care doctor on a regular basis they are no longer using very expensive ER resources because of lack of insurance In addition by seeing a primary care doctor regularly health problems can be caught early instead of waiting for them to escalate and become much more expensive to treat  So in a way it does  wipe out the cost of care that they would receive by walking into an ER by redirecting them to the much cheaper and better for there long term health primary care doctors    gt all it does is funnel additional monies into the pockets of insurers so that they are compensated for that care directly from the recipient  This is true with a literal reading of the law but its not like the insurance companies are going to be allowed to siphon off this extra revenue for profit The     rule provision in the law forces them to spend  of their revenue on actual medical care 
PoliticalDiscussion,Just because the Democrats wanted it now Makes sense 
PoliticalDiscussion,I will concede that there may be something to be said about my generation s  years old here lack of will to get out and actually protest things we really care about like the wars in Iraq Afghanistan or a potential war in Iran I wish many people I knew took a greater interest in politics and current events and it can be distressing to see how little some of my friends care  I think that a lot of frustration with the baby boomer generation though comes from the fact that many of you were able to get out in the streets and protest against Vietnam and rightfully so and yet apparently those lessons and memories were nowhere to be found when Iraq Afghanistan rolled around   The same indignation you felt at being asked by the parents and politicians of your era to fight and die in a pointless war on the other side of the world apparently didn t make enough of an impression on many boomers that they wanted to avoid asking that of their children or grandchildren  years later Yes I know no one was being drafted to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan so the comparison is not perfect I m just saying that s where some of the angst is coming from  Baby boomers who now make up a majority of legislators and voters being willing to support wars that they know they won t have to bear any of the direct responsibility to fight in or much of the financial responsibility for is part of what has inspired cynicism in my generation  Obviously no demographic is monolithic I know this isn t how all boomers feel or have acted It s just enough to make a significant impact

PoliticalDiscussion,Well I hope you find it useful I actually had to edit quite about out to cut down on some jargon and the character limits and all that But this is just one opinion and one line of argument You could make others and come to different conclusions I really just dislike the originalist logic in Scalia s Heller opinion Scalia is entertaining Very bright and pithy but has grown increasingly obnoxious self important egotistical   I don t know take your pick  over the last handful of years Also his performance in the ACA challenge this week bothered me stooping to parrot banal right wing talking points is just offensive to the Court and beneath contempt Oh well I prefer him to Thomas I had a con law prof who thought the politicization of the court was a good thing because he thought the people should not have so much trust in one single branch of government  well not good per se but the good side of an unfortunate situation  Sorry for getting off topic   For the record I m well aware of how the modern argument has shaped up I also know where my own opinions lie but what I would like is separate from the issue at hand what did the Second Amendment mean to the framers I also think for the record that the framers would find it rather bizarre that we couldn t possess guns for hunting or home defense  as do I  It would not have been issue at all at the time But if we re being honest with ourselves when we consider what  they meant neither modern reading does the amendment justice Which is is fine We do need to adapt the constitution to the the modern day  we should just be honest when we do that and not tap into the founding era rhetoric that tends to rile people into a frenzy Just call a spade a spade Adapting the Constitution to meet the needs of current age is one of its most important features and is not a rebuke of its design    My grander point  which should be obvious by now is that Union  is very different from the founding era in its very structure and expectations The participatory duty privilege citizen ideal is more or less dead and citizenship means something different these days This isn t necessarily bad At all levels we tend to be much more concerned with private matters and letting people do their own thing I know this might seem a little paradoxical with our rose tinted glasses and frontier nostalgia but it is true from a structural perspective Everyone here would have been in the militia and required to participate as our communities decided our states or the president commanded Of course there were certain tolerances but there was still plenty federal and state oversight and regulation It was far more decentralized and populist at some level which is why the gun controllers are wrong It s not about states But it s still more collective and communitarian than the individual rightists admit In short individuals were held more accountable to their communities than we tend to be today It was a messy system but that s what the founding era liked about it simply put though it s just not how the US works anymore There are various reasons militias became less of a concern as the frontier receded  and conversely true pioneers adopted a more individualist outlook anyway  as the founding generation themselves dealt with the realities of governing as foreign threats became less salient and as the rhetoric and passions of the revolution waned with age A particularly strong condemnation developed when whole generations of males in a single community tended to die since companies were all based on geographical location The fact that the North won the Civil War did the militia system no service either  and in fact reconstructionists promoted the individual rights reading for obvious reasons    One useful way to think about this shift involves the original concept of the  idiot  Our modern word derives from the Greek         originally meaning something along the lines of  a private individual  But those democratic Athenians used this in an emphatically pejorative manner to mean  self centeredness  and used it as an insult to refer to those who did not take part in public life  as well as an insult for the politically naive  Now there was no requirement that citizens vote in ancient Athens or take part in civic life but those that didn t were ridiculed insulted and deemed dishonorable This is rather similar to ideal citizen in early America  there was no requirement to participate  in some ways but not in others for example the militia  but it was frowned upon  Of course the framers very much knew this was an ideal  well they disagreed over how reasonable the expectation was  which is why so much of their government was done via representatives and appointees But the same notion was very much there those representatives were supposed be civically minded and patrons of their districts rather than up to minute mouth pieces It still relied on this lower level expectation of the citizenry Even at this level these days we expect people to vote in their own interest and their representatives to advocate them because of the representatives interest to remained elected Obviously not everyone behaves this way  for good and for bad  but this tends to be the perception and expectation    Alright I ll shut up now I ll check back again at some point in case there is any follow up but I have other things I should be doing

PoliticalDiscussion,In  the physician fee schedule was slashed once again for many services  Many doctors have taken this opportunity to sever their ties with some or all of their Medicare patients as a way of protesting the new fee schedule and to also manage their costs  As Cputerace said this is the result of an ineffective price setting scheme enacted by the Federal Government  I d suggest that you contact your Representative and Senator to let them know about your situation

PoliticalDiscussion, gt The idea behind the Republican crafted concept of mandates is that by requiring everyone to buy insurance you logically now cover everyone for healthcare   which is actually something that America does right now This is a cost saving private enterprise approach  This paragraph doesn t really make any sense  Requiring people to pay for insurance doesn t magically wipe out the cost of care that they would receive by walking into an ER without a penny in their pocket all it does is funnel additional monies into the pockets of insurers so that they are compensated for that care directly from the recipient rather than having to upcharge other individuals  This essentially causes a reversal of the current wealth transfer from being one that those who can afford healthcare  pay for the care of the poor to one where the poor are required to buy insurance so that the rates of the more wealthy go down

PoliticalDiscussion,Okay so semantically they have different meanings I ll agree with you there I guess I m not trying to argue that the mandate is a tax but I don t see how the impact on the individual would be any different than if it was a tax or a mandate 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yes absolutely 
PoliticalDiscussion,Teachers
PoliticalDiscussion, gt At least unless I can convince everyone else that YOU started it and I was fighting back in self defense      This is true   gt If I start a fight with you and put you in a position where you feel your life is in danger and you fight back and ultimately lose I can t claim self defense because I thought you were going to kill me before I killed you  This is not true and also not relevant    It would not matter what   my  state of mind was at the time  What would matter is   yours    In explanation if you start a fist fight with me and I elevate by pulling a knife  or e g  by bashing your head against the ground and you end up killing me the legal question will be whether you felt your life was in danger  w  variations across jurisdictions looking for reasonableness objectivity     So yes even if we assume Zimmerman started the fight Zimmerman can claim self defense  Regardless though your hypothetical completely disregards much of the evidence we have of the actual facts  EDIT LOL  I d also like to point out that my initial post has received no substantive argument against but is now sitting at  votes  This is what s wrong w  reddit  There s no such thing as intelligent debate or discussion b c the liberal circlejerk downvotes everything it finds uncomfortable 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt How is the healthcare individual mandate different from a tax  Because it s not I don t know how to say it any simpler then that You literally don t make one single decent argument in your post how a mandate is a tax   tax taks  Noun  A compulsory contribution to state revenue levied by the government on workers income and business profits or added to the cost of    You aren t taxed when you get a speeding ticket Do you really want the federal government to say you have to buy x product Do you really want them to have that power 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the tax power is absolute whereas the regulate interstate commerce power is not It s held that the government can only regulate existing commerce not create commerce  individual mandate in order to regulate it It s pretty different 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s what I tell everyone who doesn t vote for political or pragmatic reasons If enough people vote no it s gonna accomplish something and not voting is not voting no 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the mandate would have forced   YOU  to purchase a product from a private corporation or face a fine this is completely different than if the government spending money on health care  Medicare etc  
PoliticalDiscussion,Because buying something isn t a tax Giving the government money is a tax 
PoliticalDiscussion,Obama and the Democrats shot themselves in the foot They insisted it wasn t a tax and wrote the language as a  penalty rather than a tax   so they could tell all their supporters  We lowered taxes for  of the population   You are not forced to buy anything through taxes The government may buy things with your tax revenue but  you do not  If the historic transparency administration had actually been honest called it a tax and set it up as a single payer system or more like Social Security the supreme court would have no issue In fact if you go to the supreme court of the s and see how they ruled on Social Security you will see that the argument for why social security was constitutional was because the government was not forcing anyone to buy anything  Obama and the democrats believed they could have it both ways They were wrong 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because they worded it as a penalty If they had worded it as a tax it would be a tax and constitutionally fine if they used a rebate type system instead it s called a penalty which is much harder to find constitutional precedent for  Wickard v Filburn being one example 
PoliticalDiscussion,Yah I know thats the argument against it the thing I don t get is how the argument makes sense You re already forced to buy things through taxes so how is this any different 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt It seems like as a nation we re basically saying it s OK for young people to be forcibly compelled to fight and die for older generations but not OK for healthy people to forcibly purchase insurance that benefits them and offsets the risk of sick people who are at imminent risk of death or financial catastrophe    gt These two positions seem directly at odds with each other to me  This is a better point than the title Although a draft isn t just for  older generations as you put it  What do you have against older generations  I think there are different arguments to be had over what is more valid for a draft Is the country being attacked directly Then you can probably draft   Trying to save Vietnam from the communists No   I m not on board with your draft any longer Something like that you do like we did Iraq All volunteer  Why is that different than forcing someone to engage in commerce  Well the draft is only a war time issue and is obviously limited If forcing a person to engage in commerce is acceptable once there is no limit to it Where war is the defining and limiting factor for a draft That was what the  days in the supreme court was all about Where is the limit 
PoliticalDiscussion,Came here to say this The draft also allows for conscientious objectors whereas healthcare legislation does not 
PoliticalDiscussion,United States v Butler   gt The clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated    is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them and Congress consequently has a substantive power to tax and to appropriate limited only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide for the general welfare of the United States  It results that the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution   Helvering v Davis  gt Congress may spend money in aid of the  general welfare    There have been great statesmen in our history who have stood for other views   The line must still be drawn between one welfare and another between particular and general Where this shall be placed cannot be known through a formula in advance of the event   The discretion belongs to Congress unless the choice is clearly wrong a display of arbitrary power not an exercise of judgment This is now familiar law 
PoliticalDiscussion,It isn t about what s better or worse it s about what s constitutional The federal government cannot force you to buy something that s a state individual power  What could have been  maybe constitutional would have been to put in a healthcare tax and single payer with a tax exemption if you have healthcare insurance already However that s not what the Obama administration did   Neither the pros or cons nor the fact that it would have been functionally similar matter It s all about seperation of powers and federalism 
PoliticalDiscussion,It isn t  because you can t penalize people for failing to complete an action  It s  The Federal Government can t force people to purchase things or engage in commerce   It s quite a different reason 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The government workplace is very white collar and very unionized  Um no Government unions are for employees like DMV workers cops bus drivers teachers and parking meter maids None of those jobs are white collar   Conversely the white collar jobs in government like deputy secretaries judges executives directors and appointed officials are  non union and white collar   I challenge you to name a  specific government job that is both white collar and unionized 
PoliticalDiscussion,Both paper and gold are intrinsically valuable  The difference is that paper currency does not reflect its intrinsic value the value is imposed through fiat  by forcing people to us it as currency to buy and sell goods  That s why I call our current monetary system  violence backed  vs gold backed  
PoliticalDiscussion,Boomers are geniuses Not only did we pile up massive entitlement debt on the next generation but we created a generation of Liberals that think America should be Socialist and that they have to pay for it all SUCKERZZ 
PoliticalDiscussion,Thats why i support the bretton woods bimetallic system Silver has industrial use FDR was wise to implrement this Better yet would be a trimetallic system with perhaps palladium or platinum Btw im not a paulbot Hes good but the republican party stinks Gary Johnson  
PoliticalDiscussion,remember as i said in my comment to cassander they want the same thing  in the grand scheme of things  no republicans or democrats  well known ones anyway want anarchy communism dictatorship etc 
PoliticalDiscussion,very good point i think the big problem is that people are happy with how things are but they just dont realize how far off we are from where we are supposed to be prime example Rick Santorum and separation from church and state 
PoliticalDiscussion,on the contrary i ve heard i believe it s Thomas Jefferson believed that the constitution should be rewritten every  years  one generation to keep up with the times 
PoliticalDiscussion,It s a funny  gotcha  moment but I don t think it s going to do any serious harm to his campaign for better or worse Unless much of the MSM picks this up  and I haven t kept up with the story since I saw the video this morning so maybe it has obviously Yahoo picked it up  it ll just keep to the Interwebz  I m not saying all his supporters are racist but they would certainly overlook this He is a man of God afterall Or whatever he is 
PoliticalDiscussion,well my point was that we want the same thing  in the grand scheme of things  neither side wants communism anarchy dictatorship etc   what i m really trying to point out is that they consider themselves sworn enemies when they agree on what they need for the most part just disagree on how to go about it 
PoliticalDiscussion,that was just something i heard on the news wasnt really paying attention he could have been embellishing or talking about something else 
PoliticalDiscussion,They need it to mean something when he eventually endorses Mitt Romney 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nope  The last thing we need to do is legitimize baseless reflexive racism allegations by discussing them 
PoliticalDiscussion,So wait was the entire point of this post to get out your conspiracy theory that Santorum and Gingrich are knowingly and purposely burning political capital personal credibility and millions of dollars in campaign funds as part of a calculated plan to screw Ron Paul s bid over Have you really sat down and though that out critically  Romney does not need help in defeating Paul If Santorum and Gingrich weren t still in the race Romney would already be the de facto nominee Paul might still be running but he d be already more on the fringe of the conversation than he currently is  The guy raises a few valid points amidst a sea of much crazier and controversial ideas He has reached a limit on the amount of support he can drum up 
PoliticalDiscussion,You have to remember that everything Santorum says and does is an act for the American Public And every once in a while his real attitude shines through  Blah people  Bullshit   Government Nig ah ff  I can see him saying government nigger more frequently than government nik Also nik Really He   very clearly  said ni  g   not nik All these apologists for his gaffs just make me laugh  No he said nik or neg or anything but nig Your ears   LIE     
PoliticalDiscussion,Well TIL 
PoliticalDiscussion, nik is frequently added to words to mean a person who does or endorses that thing or action Peacenik Refusenik Etc  I hate Santorum as much as the next guy  and being from Pennsylvania hasvr hated him longer than most people  but when I heard this speech I heard  antiwar government nik  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Individual states already require drivers to have car insurance why can t the government require all citizens to have health insurance  Because of the United States Constitution Maybe you ve heard of it The highest law in the land That is why Also how did Obamacare make healthcare affordable 
PoliticalDiscussion,I feel like your sub reddit won t be very useful busy Maybe four decades ago but not so much right now 
PoliticalDiscussion,No read into the economics of the plan if you cannot understand    You reduce the risk to insurers by requiring everyone to be insured  This protects the investor class as insurers will not have to pay the bill of those that do not rely on a healthy lifestyle and abuse the guaranteed emergency healthcare right of Americans Right now insurers just move those costs to the customer  That is why America pays more than ANYONE in the world for healtcare at the moment   and guess what    we do not have the longest life expectancy lowest infant mortality rate etc etc  So some claim that American healthcare is the  gold standard doesn t apply    This is why the business class hyped mandates and crafted Romneycare and led to Newt Gingrich supporting mandates in the s  Now the political right is suffering from ignorant amnesia  Put the pieces together 
PoliticalDiscussion,That is the point you are arguing semantics  Everyone is guaranteed health care but HOW and WHEN it is administered is a different story  An effective way to frame the debate on Obamacare is that detractors are really pushing in the direction for a  let them die platform which is radical  Meaning if you cannot pay drop dead or pray the likes of Rick Santorum start contributing a heck of a more to charity   
PoliticalDiscussion,Well it s not that I m refusing to acknowledge differences that are there I m saying that difference didn t exist at that time  I could equally say that you re refusing to acknowledge that they referred to the same group of people  At founding there was no substantive difference between being a militiaman and being a citizen The two went hand in hand and were one and the same By virtue of being born a healthy male I couldn t get out of militia duty and even if I really didn t want to   for example they knocked the contentious objector clause out that was present in a draft  That s what the framers envisioned   Just to be clear I don t think this act has anything to do with the commerce power It s just an example of a Congress instituting a mandate to make that ends up forcing  some people to enter into commerce Just as some people already owned a gun back then some people already have insurance today in both cases those who lack something are compelled by law to obtain it I could replace all mentions of purchasing or buying health insurance from the current law and replace it with  providing for yourself  but that doesn t change the fact that ultimately people have to buy it I don t see the substantive difference The same was true with the Miltia Act even if you could procure a gun  and there were other requirements by other means and only had to resort to purchasing one as a last resort  today you could get insurance from your spouse s plan You only need to pay yourself as a last resort  Even still I also don t see much difference between mandating that someone to go out of his way taking the time and effort to procure and maintain all this items and then participate in something they don t want to do and using money to accomplish the same ends  which you earn though labor time and effort etc    As Marshall laid out in  McCulloch  if Congress has the power to do something under one clause it should be valid under clauses  he compared the chartering of a bank to the explicitly acceptable chartering of a territorial government  If mandates work for militias they work for commerce This is in addition to all the commerce clause precedent like  Laughlin Steel Corp  and  Lopez  which I think holds   Thanks for the argument and discussion  
PoliticalDiscussion, Never  to my knowledge  has the term  government nigger been used   I ve heard it before It means a black person on welfare   As documented on Prince Paul s  record  A Prince of Thieves   For every government nigga there s government cheese  I don t think it s very commonly used I believe it also appears in HBO s mini series  The Corner which is probably where I heard it first   EDIT Here s a right wing nut job using it in  He even registered a domain for it    
PoliticalDiscussion,I am a big believer in States rights  Your post is silly  Let s pretend for a second that the firearms bill you mention in the comments has a snowball s chance in hell of passing it still can claim justification from the Second Amendment and  years of precedent interpreting the Constitution as giving individuals the right to bear and own guns  The Bill of Rights is virtually never an issue when States rights supporters speak up  You mention marriage  Marriage is not in the Constitution and marriage laws have not otherwise been treated w  strict scrutiny due to fundamental rights concerns  You mention drugs  I don t even know of when a bill has been proposed which would allow one State to disregard the drug laws of other States  Regardless again the right to use drugs is not in the Constitution  I support gay marriage and don t actually care if weed is legalized  Your post though is just plain silly 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt They do not ever decide what freedoms people are to have  Dred Scott
PoliticalDiscussion,Making it  and older is just going to drive people away 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right Paying into a pool  buying health insurance I was phrasing it in the OPs wording 
PoliticalDiscussion,I know   you re just countering my argument that he doesn t use naughty language Perhaps I should have said  generally    But are you really suggesting that because he used the word  bullshit recently he probably uses the word  nigger so much in private that it slipped out publicly 
PoliticalDiscussion,I looked at the first few pages of google hits for  governmentnik and it seems like you are right it is indeed a word Sure all the hits have to do with Santorum and the word was only invented today but it is indeed a word   gt Governmentnik was not a word before but it is now Imagine that Just like that New word 
PoliticalDiscussion,Haha it s all an anti Ron Paul conspiracy   sssuuurrreee Maybe people don t vote for Ron Paul because they legitimately don t want him to be president 
PoliticalDiscussion,Let it be known that Santorum has used the word  bullshit when talking to a reporter recently  I deem this to be a naughty word 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I think there will be a lot of similarities between gay marriage adoption and health care reform over the next few years  Here s the one similarity balkanization of the entire US citizenry   I d like to take that job  over there but I can t because my marriage would be invalid and I d lose my health insurance coverage    Yeah my child would really benefit by attending that school  over there  but I couldn t be her legal adoptive parent and we d all lose our health insurance coverage    I d like to move closer to my elderly parents  over there  but I can t because I d lose my health insurance coverage  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The mandate doesn t  allow healthy Americans to pay into a pool It requires that you do or you pay a tax penalty   That s not even true The mandate requires you have health insurance  That s it There s no  pool   Well there is but it s the same pool that people have been using for centuries it s called insurance  The OP would be unaffected by the individual mandate because he has insurance already 
PoliticalDiscussion,Nobody s really answered your question specifically  Here s the difference between the two first  The mandate is to buy health insurance under threat of penalty  Purchasing health insurance is a contract The Federal government cannot force you to enter a contract with anyone On top of that it s forcing you to enter a contract with a private party which will allow the private party will make a profit That s doubly an issue  Your state government can force you to enter a contract so can your localities if it s allowed by state law But the Constitution forbids the Federal government from doing it  Taxes are different because you re not buying anything specifically You re being forced to contribute funds to be distributed at a later time or even refunded if your owed amount is less than you paid You re not entering a contract with anyone nor are you being forced to participate in a financial transaction with anyone You re not buying anything you re ostensibly contributing to the general welfare  You ve read all this from other people but I wanted to get that said before I answered your question  The difference for us the consumer is who has control over the healthcare choices   In a single payer plan all of our choices are limited by the parameters of the government   Under the mandate we actually enter into contracts with insurance companies and any contract s terms can be negotiated to the benefit of any party We choose the insurance company we choose the terms we choose the level of coverage we choose the providers of care  The economies of scale make me think that a tax on everyone for a single payer plan would spread the costs more efficiently guaranteeing a better spread of services for everyone with less cost But a mandate allows everyone to tailor their healthcare to their needs and desires and keeps bureaucrats out of medical choices   Does that help     
PoliticalDiscussion,He is not in it to win He s a tool to make sure ron paul has as few delegates as possible Gingrich too 
PoliticalDiscussion,Social Security covered less than  of the people it covers today things like this take time To roll almost everyone into a single payer system in less than  years would be chaotic and disastrous We ll get there eventually  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Never  to my knowledge  has the term  government nigger been used It sounds to me like Santorum is saying  anti war governmentnik  I agree there is not a day that goes by where someone doesn t use the word  governmentnik  When was the last time anyone used the word nigger anyway      seriously I have no idea what the hell he was starting to say but I can totally see why people would naturally assume it was  nigger  
PoliticalDiscussion,You really believe that they sat down and said  Rick you know what you should do Almost say  nigger  but not completely say it That ll get us delegates       This is pretty ridiculous 
PoliticalDiscussion,The healthcare market in the US is also affected by the problem of adverse selection So people not buying healthcare insurance means that if you re buying it you re more likely to be ill so health care companies factor that risk into the price  it is insurance after all   It also suffers from the free rider problem I don t believe there are any markets that display the health market s characteristics 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt As a citizen of the US in the th century I was required to get my hands on a rifle and many other supplies and maintain these supplies by law  No As a member of the militia you were Not as a citizen   gt Not even a blip of a constitutional objection  That is because the constitution gives the right to the government to create a militia and nobody objected to it It s very clearly in the constitution And also the country was  years old and on the constant verge or threat of being taken apart I suspect most people understood the necessity in a number of ways   gt True I may borrow these things I could inherit them too But if I can t do this or if the person letting me use them wants it back I am compelled by law to get my hands one  Yup I m sure there were many who showed ill prepared with none of the supplies   None of that matters What matters is the wording in the law You claim it compels to buy but that is not true It doesn t No where is it compelling that you buy it I don t know why you refuse to concede that point   gt In short they lost their relevance  Yeah I suspected that after the civil war they were simply replaced with national guard troops instead  Thanks for the conversation and information I d say your argument is far better than the wheat case from the s But I still say there are key differences  which you refuse to acknowledge that prevent it from being viewed as a precedent Those two being the  Conscripted Militia and  Provide   See you around 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the most pressing problem in America is clearly the lack of hero villain melodrama in our political system 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think any military engagement with Iran would more closely imitate Libya than Iraq Just like Libya you ve got a large young population that has protested against the government in the past  Green Movement  The US would provide the air superiority and material support but wouldn t commit ground forces so we don t get stuck with the long and expensive occupation 
PoliticalDiscussion,I grant you that the ACA extends to a broader swath of people  for example children  but by all of society I meant  and should have clarified public society Citizens Voters The stuff of democracy Back then women children  and slaves  were not citizens were not  the people as understood by those words but various dependent persons The six months in the act refers to a grace period given to this citizen after he enrolled with his local officer the company during which time he is supposed to secure all of these supplies This six month period was useful if a citizen moved or when this law was first enacted   I find your objection to calling this commerce as forced As a citizen of the US in the th century I was required to get my hands on a rifle and many other supplies and maintain these supplies by law True I may borrow these things I could inherit them too But if I can t do this or if the person letting me use them wants it back I am compelled by law to get my hands one Certainly  some substantial number of people had to buy them  if not weapons then the supplies Besides the Act requires that after  years all rifles be of a sufficient standard Clearly this act is forcing some people to buy  or trade or make still all commercial prospects new arms as well various accoutrements My larger point is that no one in the founding era protested that this was mandate was unlawful because  some people would have to buy firearms or supplies Not even a blip of a constitutional objection It s a mandate to have X If you don t already have X you need to get it If you could not obtain X by some other means then you have to buy X You can fill in X with either miltia provisions or health insurance   Again you re just misunderstanding the way the founding era militia That s because it s very foreign to how how we understand citizenship today If you were a US citizen and were not deemed incapable of fighting  including being a dependent child or  too old  or for example crippled  you were obligated to serve in the local militia This did or would include virtually every citizen at some point unless they were physically unfit to serve or over  at the time of the revolution These were the exceptions amongst the citizenry not the militia at large It was pretty much everyone In addition to these broad exceptions  the young who will likely serve one day and old  specific exceptions were given to citizens who worked in the state interest  again the theme is service    For your last point I actually made this temporary account to largely discuss founding era militias The whole US militia system gradually fell out of favor for many reasons some cultural some practical In short they lost their relevance One key point that I have made elsewhere is that citizens in the founding era were expected to be republican citizens in a republican democracy with explicit duties and privileges Non citizens did not have the same rights as citizens did  though they certainly shared many  but also did not the duties One of these duties was militia service  another jury duty has made it into the modern era more intact  These duties were just was what you did and might include provisioning oneself or taking time to drill for the good of the country Since then we have adopted a more liberal democratic view Voting and citizenship is no longer predicated on military service and are just things we are expected to have among other things This ideological shift is key though subtle    Some other issues militia duty grew less salient as revolutionary era foreign threats lessened as the frontier receded as the founding generation themselves faced the realities of governing as Americans became increasingly removed from revolutionary rhetoric One practical concern was that local communities could lose a significant portion of their males since militias were organized by locality Another was the unsurprising observation that militias generally tend to be poorly trained and disciplined and a less than ideal fighting force By the Civil War militias were shadows of the framer s ideal  and indeed what the laws required  Anyway they were formerly conscripted into the Union Army and as you can imagine during the reconstruction era most northerners did not extol the civic virtues of militia with local character and in the south it did not help that a large number of the southern militias were black now that they were citizens too   
PoliticalDiscussion,Precisely His track record betrays him as a big government phony but his anti gay anti choice racist   rhetoric makes him a hero villain in the play 
PoliticalDiscussion,You re taking for granted that he is a serious campaigner and not just a foil to the truly conservative Paul campaign 
PoliticalDiscussion,Santorum is simply not a serious candidate  He s being used as an actor in a play where Americans pretend we have functional political representation  He is given media attention because somebody finds him useful and because he gives a very small part of the population the impression that somebody in politics cares about them 
PoliticalDiscussion,Agreed I don t need to look for might bes and coud haves with Santorum The things he says clearly are repulsive enough 
PoliticalDiscussion,This won t end his run His supporters won t care because they won t believe he said it whether he did or not or they would support him even if he did It won t help him win anyone over but his campaign has never cared about appealling to more moderate voters Besides he just wants to make sure he is second place in everyone s minds  the Republicans always nominate the guy who came in second the previous primary 
PoliticalDiscussion,People on the right like to talk about people on the left getting hysterical over imagined slights Usually they re talking out of their ass   so it pains me to see this  controversy where people on the left are getting upset over an imagined slight   Never  to my knowledge  has the term  government nigger been used It sounds to me like Santorum is saying  anti war government nik   like  beatnik    certainly diminutive a little bit derogatory but not racist   I doubt the word  nigger is in his vocabulary Have you listened to him I don t think he uses  naughty language and this sort of slip would suggest that he often uses the word which would certainly be out of character   I hate the guy everything he says and everything he stands for I hate him for things  he has said and done  We don t need to dig into grey areas to try to smear him Let  his policy be his undoing 
PoliticalDiscussion,A much better argument is selective service violates the th amendment 
PoliticalDiscussion,So the one thing that I m hesitant to go with the article on is that Santorum is using his mumblings as key words and hidden messages to others Come on now The guy and his entire campaign staff have some sense I can t imagine that they would actually plan for him to mumble a racial slur in order to tip  like minded people off The negatives of this action just dont seem worth it
PoliticalDiscussion, gt but if we dont start we cant get anywhere Its like saying oh that will take a long time to accomplish so if we dont do anything long enough it will happen on its own  Replacing perfectly good capital investment is a huge waste of money  Far cheaper to let the current crop of stuff get through its lifetime and replace it little by little    And I don t just mean it will take a long time  it is IMPOSSIBLE for hte government to do this  If George Bush had come into office with his number  priority being to shore up the levies in New Orleans he wouldn t have even starting construction by the time Katrina hit  Any such a massive project would be held up in lawsuits for decades at multiple points  Our government is simply incapable of a project on that level anymore   gt U S will end up paying for it later  Paying for it later would be better  We ll be richer later so it will be relatively cheaper  
PoliticalDiscussion,Ahh but you see when you replace the things that you are able to the price and demand of oil goes down so that the planes and trucks can operate at a more manageable cost I agree that this is highly idealized and wont happen quickly at all but if we dont start we cant get anywhere Its like saying oh that will take a long time to accomplish so if we dont do anything long enough it will happen on its own Well maybe but if that does occur it will be that other countries have developed the technology and put the systems in place to accomplish this and the U S will end up paying for it later Thats not the situation that I want this country to end up in nor what I believe to be how the U S wants the rest of the world to see 
PoliticalDiscussion,I think we re on the same track here This would allow conservative states to try healthcare vouchers and liberal states could offer a public option 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Good point 
PoliticalDiscussion,Very good point from both of you I don t know why Stormflux is being downvoted because in truth that s an honest point religion does tend to be anti intellectual  That doesn t mean religious people aren t smart it means the culture of religion is not to question and thus we have the religious right   I think the Anti intellectualism is going to pass although it will take time  I mean the internet is creating education nearly uncensored and at this point it will become difficult to stop  The only thing is this country that brings hope to me is the internet 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Businesses would be required to offer it under that wouldn t they  Not  sure what  That is but if you re referring to the Vermont plan than they are working to make the employer funding go into the state plan   gt k a year for health insurance is insane and many people below k a year would just not be able to afford it therefore government would have to either supplement making it so expensive to try to retain private insurance at that point many would simply say we might as well go full national coverage  Many say right now we should go for national coverage however just as many don t want that Hence why I m advocating for a state based solution to fit our diverse nation    gt if government did not supplement private industry would take the initiative and start offering lower premiums to more people in order to compensate If I am a private insurer and I have  people pay me k a year for health insurance why can t I also have  people pay me only k a year It s the same either way plus eventually those paying k a year would realize how retarded that is and decide they also want the lower premium and suddenly health insurance would be affordable It would be stupid NOT to be insured if it was reasonably priced   Insurance companies already offered tiered coverage I just did a quick online quote and was able to individual coverage for about  month The insurance companies know not everyone can afford top level care which is why the plans come with different features  deductibles etc   
PoliticalDiscussion,I mean if you leave it to state government radicalism would run even more rampant in this country I lived in Germany for  years and I hope I can refine my german a bit and get financially stable to move back there 
PoliticalDiscussion,The militia power is a separate power from the power to regulate commerce  A differently part of the Constitution means different rules 
PoliticalDiscussion,Well American as it stands is in a desperate state of anti intellectualism that causes most of our problems in an ideal government we would in my world have little to no military expenditures a heavy focus on infrastructure and education and after that phase move into education health care and and scientific funding to benefit society as a whole  Very very socialist and I ll admit that 
PoliticalDiscussion,Not really a revolution  The colonists did not abolish their colonial governments they merely seceded from british control  They later voluntarily formed a new central government while still preserving their state governments  This is actually one of the many arguments in favor of strong federalism  It lets you have quasi revolutions where you can destroy part of your system of government but not all of it which is much safer  
PoliticalDiscussion,What about the American Revolution 
PoliticalDiscussion,Proportional representation with a binding  NOTA clause   such that if NOTA wins the duopoly  or polyopoly as the case may be has to provide new candidates and the election is held again 
PoliticalDiscussion, How would everyone having private insurance have lowered costs The costs would ve continued to rise and would have been reflected in your premiums  Also under the Affordable Healthcare Act businesses would no longer be allowed to just raise premiums for the hell of it there is tons and tons of money to be made in private healthcare as a direct connection to ridiculously high premiums that do not go toward actual healthcare costs and instead go to shareholder profit accounts This is illegal under the affordable care act a certain amount of money from every dollar I beliebe it is  cents for every  MUST be spent on healthcare and premiums are not allowed to increase 
PoliticalDiscussion,Ah I thought you meant you could get up to k a year a year in subsidies 
PoliticalDiscussion,Businesses would be required to offer it under that wouldn t they And seriously if I tried buying healthcare myself not through my work I would basically have to pay like  grand a year out of pocket for it the only way I can afford it now is because my work pays part of the premium so I pay about k a year and they pay about k   k a year for health insurance is insane and many people below k a year would just not be able to afford it therefore government would have to either supplement making it so expensive to try to retain private insurance at that point many would simply say we might as well go full national coverage if government did not supplement private industry would take the initiative and start offering lower premiums to more people in order to compensate If I am a private insurer and I have  people pay me k a year for health insurance why can t I also have  people pay me only k a year It s the same either way plus eventually those paying k a year would realize how retarded that is and decide they also want the lower premium and suddenly health insurance would be affordable It would be stupid NOT to be insured if it was reasonably priced 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt What congress has done  with the aid of the executive is implemented a          bill whose source of funding comes from forcing people to buy a private service  Government enforces the healthcare monopoly by forbidding the sale of health insurance over state lines As a result good coverage is prohibitvely expensive for a lot of people   Government enforces the public school monopoly by mandating people under a certain age attend and making one option  free  This distorts the market and ensures private education is prohibitively expensive for most people  Utilities roads research these goods and services we could pay for voluntarily as soon as the federal income tax wasn t garnishing  of our wages on top of the gas tax we pay for roads and property tax we pay for schools  
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The condition of invasion or national danger explains when the president can lawfully command the militias of the several states to act in the service of the US as opposed to their state or local interests It sets the conditions for when militias must abide by direct federal authority  I agree I read that part wrong I only read the May  and misread it at that I do see your point and you are right here   gt and were effectively all of society  No they were not Not women children under  or those over  Your use of  effectively does not mean it includes all of society I understand it is a large section but it is still a specific section As well the requirement to provide something  not buy something doesn t start until that subset of society has been conscripted  within  months after conscription to be exact    gt The act does not merely conscript people into militias as it would an army  I didn t say that was all it did I said that was the first thing it did and it is Both the May  and May  version start with conscription So I was right to say that it is not a law that effects everyone it is specific to militia  only  The wording here is very clear   gt How else do you provide for them but by them  If you already owned one you need not buy one You could borrow one like your father s or your uncle s who fought in the revolution   The wording is very specific and does not say  Buy or  Purchase anywhere in there So again I am right on this   gt That every citizen so enrolled and notified  The  So enrolled and notified describes which type of citizen  Militia member and sets them apart from all of society You can hop up and down about it being virtually everyone all that you like the wording does not agree with you It isn t an order for all society it is an order for the militia only   gt If you did not have your own supplies you would logically have to provide for them  Yup Provide for them There is nothing in that wording that requires you purchase them  If you are going to be a stickler you have to apply it to your own argument as well Your cries of  Virtually do not make this act a precedent for forcing commerce   gt I think your mistake is conflating the militia with the military They are quite different  Actually my only mistake was reading the May nd version as a trigger effect for being conscripted to be in the militia  I don t pretend to be an expert on this act All I know is what I read in the link I provided and what the definitions of the words are that are used in the text  I am curious as to why we are no longer required to join a militia Was this repealed at some point 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt I don t think the states alone will ever do it It is sad if the healthcare mandate is deemed unconstitutional with it healthcare would have been more accessible and more affordable since it is something we would all be required to have  How would everyone having private insurance have lowered costs The costs would ve continued to rise and would have been reflected in your premiums   gt ndividual states already require drivers to have car insurance why can t the government require all citizens to have health insurance  There is a vast difference between the powers of the federal government and states abilities This is why I think achieving health care reform on a state level is much more practical than on a national one    gt As long as it is a choice for the states healthcare will never be offered The only way a nationally supported healthcare program would work is if it was required by the entire nation not a state run program  I must admit I don t think we ll ever have one nationally support healthcare program Unlike countries like Sweden and Norway we re exponentially more ethically and culturally diverse and what works in Alabama might not work in Ohio or Washington We ve also got a far larger population than either country and actually have multiple cities with populations that exceed either country   Having healthcare reform on a state by state basis would allow the program to fit the needs of each state If Kentucky wants a voucher system then they can have it while another state can decide the right program for them   
PoliticalDiscussion,My ideal healthcare solution would be to abolish the federal role entirely in favor of state run systems  Let each one set up their own system then we can see which ones work best and adopt the best ones   
PoliticalDiscussion,This is how revolutions ALWAYS end  When you destroy the existing authority the nastiest most ruthless and best organized group takes over every time  By definition this is not the liberals  This is why revolutions as opposed to coups and secession are a BAD idea 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt When Christianity came and the orthodox pope was in power he also asked for the burning of the library of Alexandria  The library was burned before that happened it accidentally caught fire during Caesar s siege of Cleopatra and Antony  The disturbance you referred to burned down the building it was a pagan temple of sorts but most likely not many important documents 
PoliticalDiscussion,I don t think the states alone will ever do it It is sad if the healthcare mandate is deemed unconstitutional with it healthcare would have been more accessible and more affordable since it is something we would all be required to have Individual states already require drivers to have car insurance why can t the government require all citizens to have health insurance  States already have the ability to provide health insurance if they choose to many simply choose not to Here in Arizona we had a great system called ACCCHS and I was in a program called KidsCare which allowed me to get insurance for my daughter for  a month They scrapped both of these programs when Jan Brewer came into office   As long as it is a choice for the states healthcare will never be offered The only way a nationally supported healthcare program would work is if it was required by the entire nation not a state run program 
PoliticalDiscussion,It does not cost  dollars a barrel to pump oil at least not in the US  The cost varies a lot depending on what country you are though and might cost that little somewhere 
PoliticalDiscussion,They receive subsidies for both actually depending on what the company in question is actually doing   gt As in the transit system shouldnt be based off oil  At present this is simply impossible  You cannot replace planes and trucks and planes and trucks need to run on oil  You could theoretically replace oil for fuel in trains but it would require a vast expense to electrify all the rail replace all the trains and to build enough nuclear power plants to both power all those trains and replace all the plants that currently run on oil coal gas  It s a project that would take decades under ideal circumstances even if you didn t get stopped by environmental impact requirements and nimbyism every step of the way which you absolutely would  As a practical matter this too is an impossible project 
PoliticalDiscussion,Because we don t want the same things 
PoliticalDiscussion,The basic idea is that the program would decide what the reimbursement rate would be for X procedure  This happens to a certain extent with private insurance right now My mom works as a therapist and  of her business comes from insurance companies They decide the number of treatments each patient gets and what the rate of compensation is  The biggest problem I can see Vermont having is going to be getting the program truly rolled out They re hoping to get funding from the national government the state and also private employers who would fund this program instead of private health insurance programs for their workers   I don t know enough about the details but it ll be interesting to watch this unfold They had initially planned to go live in  but that would get fast tracked if the mandate got shot down 
PoliticalDiscussion,That s just completely incorrect  What draft do you mean The first part of the act was passed on May  the second part was passed on May  The May  portions mostly dealt with the larger national security issue  how do we sync the militias within a federal organization framework  and the May  portions dealt with the logistics and the details   The condition of invasion or national danger explains when the president can lawfully command the militias of the several states to act in the service of the US as opposed to their state or local interests It sets the conditions for when militias must abide by direct federal authority   The act does not merely conscript people into militias as it would an army Men ages  were the vast majority   the people   of the United States and were effectively all of society  The people was the miltia There is as this act makes clear virtually no distinction unless that citizen was too old to provide service to his country and had done his time so to speak This was not a subset or an exception this was everyone  with exceptions  Militias were not temporary although federal command was conditional Once you were in a militia you served until you completed your service End of story   How else do you provide for them but by them You could steal them or make them yourself sure but I think most people probably bought them In any event any of those certainly qualifies as commerce  The militia did not provide the militiaman with anything as this act makes clear  That every citizen so enrolled and notified  which is as I emphasized virtually every citizen  shall   provide  himself with  all of the following supplies   Emphasis mine The act clearly mandates that every citizen  which again is virtually all citizens procure supplies in his private capacity If you did not have your own supplies you would logically have to provide for them  I think your mistake is conflating the militia with the military They are quite different 
PoliticalDiscussion,How does the Vermont system control costs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Rallying to their cause and killing their enemies  Get support of the military crush these theocratic morons mercilessly and get the pen to the paper on a legitimate constitution  But they won t so they will be marginalized and cast away 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt Renewables receive orders of magnitude more subsidies than the oil and gas industry when measuring on a per Watt basis  This lead me to believe that they are receiving their subsidies for producing electricity and not for developing their technology or strengthening the infrastructure Also even though the receive more money on a per Watt basis  if this is true im not sure about the numbers I m just taking your word for it the oil industry has far more influence on the politics in our country This means that they have other legislature working for them where I believe that the legislature should instead be working towards making our nation run off of renewable sources As in the transit system shouldnt be based off oil
PoliticalDiscussion,Why do you think that To be honest having a vague opinion like that is as dangerous as wholeheartedly believing in any conspiracy   Of course the more out there ones are considerably ridiculous Dick Cheney being some kind of reptile alien   or just reptile aliens being on earth in general But don t just assume theories are bullshit history has proven time and time again that the  historical truth is never honest 
PoliticalDiscussion,Exactly Our culture technology and environment effect natural selection Would the OP say that ants are subverting natural selection by forming a colony 
PoliticalDiscussion,Right So the end result is the same regardless of if it was a mandate or a tax break As it stands now you would have  dollars taken out of your tax refund aka your net loss is  dollars If it was reworded everybody who didn t get insurance wouldn t qualify for a  dollar tax break aka their net loss is  dollars  I think there is a point though to this distinction between taxes and penalties For one taxes have to be appropriated to things but penalties do not So nothing demands the penalty money they collect goes to gov health programs but if it was a tax it would have to  but I guess then they could just pass a budget review that takes money out of health program fund lol  
PoliticalDiscussion,It s still a mandate It s just a weak one that may be ineffective Hopefully healthy people still buy insurance to avoid the penalty If they don t the plan is kind of fucked   unless the Federal government steps in with some massive subsidies 
PoliticalDiscussion, EVERYONE is guaranteed health care  Yes but only emergency care If they can get you our the door breathing in  stable condition that s where free care ends for most The problem with this approach is over the long run it s actually a lot more expensive Emergency care is more expensive for various reasons and failing to actually treat the problem fully ensures repeated need for emergency care It s a vicious cycle These people also do not have access to preventative care which is increasingly becoming the best tool we have to reduce health care costs 
PoliticalDiscussion,Instead of a multi trillion dollar nebula they should just let insurance companies compete nation wide instead of enforcing a state by state monopoly People talk about Obamacare and the  million person risk pool as if government is powerless to let private companies have such a pool Repeal McCarran Fergusson is all 
PoliticalDiscussion, Basically the only way to fund the universal healthcare bill is to include the individual mandate   No The individual mandate is the only way to harness the existing private health insurance market to provide  near universal coverage    Otherwise we will have another entitlement program that we can t afford to pay for   ObamaCare is not a new entitlement or even really an entitlement at all It does change the eligibility rules for Medicaid Medicare however the individual mandate exists so private insurance companies can afford to pay for things like covering pre existing conditions extending coverage for kids to the age of  lifting life time caps etc   The expansion of Medicaid Medicare is paid for mostly from existing funding That part of the ACA can stand without the individual mandate if the SCOTUS wanted to Same with the  donut hole coverage They would probably want to leave the explicit tax on luxury health care plans in place too though since that does cover part of the funding    So reddit please tell me why I should support paying for other people s healthcare when I have paid over   in healthcare premiums in the past  years and have been to the doctor for a check up   Because that s how insurance works You will get old sick and eventually die Some young person in X years will be asking why they have to pay for your care Thing is it s hard to go earn an income to pay for your own medical care when you re dying of cancer No matter how you dice this you   are  going to pay for other peoples care Either via your insurance premium via your taxes for Medicaid Medicare or by higher medical costs when others can t pay their bills You ve been paying other people s health care bills ever since you started paying taxes or had private insurance The individual mandate brings people who choose not to have insurance into the system If you re upset about paying for other people s health care you should be  pro indivudal mandate 
PoliticalDiscussion,That would be called a tax break and not a mandate There is a difference If that is the case I ll just pay the  and then just buy insurance once I get sick since they can t reject me 
PoliticalDiscussion,Rep Lloyd Dogget told my school Obamacare was passed to give us another option  that the  big five had a monopoly and usually in any given town there were only two or three health care insurers   That s because the federal government won t allow companies to sell HI over state lines based on an law from  that was supposed to prevent monopolies   Instead the big boys just bought the companies in the other states and became the extorting giants we know today If the government really wanted to help they would allow a plurality to compete Instead they are just offering another monopoly though it s a mandatory one   Doggett actually said  We did this so you have another option  I call bullshit  they did this because it s popular with the  progressives and the big five insurance companies wanted it It will take some pressure off of hospitals and that s good for the gigantic insurance companies Pass the buck on to the taxpayer   
PoliticalDiscussion,And by not fundamental I don t mean not worthy of being pursued just that the law could be changed so that it preserves its initial intent 
PoliticalDiscussion, gt The Miltia Act of  mandated almost all citizens to privately purchase muskets  Nope You are pointing at the first draft legislation and so the same argument applies It all hinges on  whenever the United States shall be invaded or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe  The act conscripted  year olds  or something like that into the state militia not all of society Once a person was conscripted  then the mandate kicked in for the militia to provide arms  It also doesn t say they need to buy them  Just provide them For most citizens in  the flintlock was used for catching dinner   This is quite different than ordering non military to purchase insurance   
PoliticalDiscussion,WTF are you saying Cognitive dissonance much 
PoliticalDiscussion,What about thw stipulations for an employer A lot of businesses are also required to provide insurance or pay the fine And that insurance is required to contain provisions the employer could religiously object to i e blood transfusions birth control organ replacement etc
