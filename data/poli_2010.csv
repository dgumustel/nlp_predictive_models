ricecake,1220422780.0,,,t2_38ev7,"To a large degree it's because of the way that various ethnic groups have clumped together into different neighborhoods.  From talking with an ex's stepdad, he talked about how there were different neighbor hoods for different races, and because there were different levels of crime in the various neighborhoods, mostly due to economics, so you learned to associate risk with different neighborhoods, and from there it was a close slide to associating the ethnicities of the neighborhoods with danger.  When combined with racial tensions from decades ago, you see the result that a lot of petty crime is directed into different racial communities, and so the tension, suspicion, and drawing in of the various neighborhoods grows.  A good example of this is when me and one of my friends, neither of us had really spent much time in Detroit, went down from Lansing to see a concert.  While we were leaving, we got lost, because Detroit has the most goddamned complicated roads I've ever seen, and we pulled into gas station to ask for directions.  When my friend went in, he went to look for a drink to buy, couldn't find one, and the clerk assumed that he was shoplifting, making him lift his shirt up, and spin in a circle, and refusing to give directions.  While I was waiting in the car, a homeless man came up to the car, and told me that I was obviously not from Detroit, and that we might want to leave, and soon.  So we did, and we both concluded that perhaps Detroit has some social aspects that we didn't completely understand, having grown up in Lansing, or the suburbs of Lansing.  
I guess when you take a city, rapidly industrialize it, have an influx of people of all different kinds from all over the world, cram them into a small area, all during a time of some of the countries highest racial tensions, and then pull out all of that industry, you're going to have some big problems.",0,1269804639,,0,c0n2j45,t3_bja00,4,t1_c0n24vt,15036,1426257055,2,False,politics,t5_2cneq,,,2010

Not necessarily. It's possible on use the ""A"" word based on information in the media about the supposed realities of life in Israel. This would only be anti-semitism if it was motivated by dislike or prejudice against Jews in general. 

If Israel really can't be categorized as an apartheid state then the other option is that these people are ill-informed. Anti-semitism isn't the only explanation. 

(For the record as someone who has first hand experience I'd say that current and recent Israeli government policy is wrong, unpleasant and evil, but not necessarily all that similar to apartheid.)

Liberal anti-war protestors that called Bush a Nazi were never publicly supported by the democratic party. This institutionalization is pretty radical. Finally, the anti-war marches actually involved as many people but were far less hyperbolic overall.

&gt;**GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham: Obama Is a Role Model Not a Socialist**

&gt;Graham is certain to earn more Tea Party wrath for defending Obama.

&gt;Sen. Lindsey Graham was on NBC’s Meet The Press today where he maintained his conservative stance on health care, but he took a moment to criticize the right wing rhetoric on Obama and racism of the Tea Party. Graham said, “When you use the N word and when you question somebody’s patriotism, you’re off base. President Obama is a fine man. He’s a good father. He’s a good role model.”
Here is the video from NBC:

&gt;Sen. Graham made it clear that he is a conservative and opposed to health care reform, but he sees no place for the personal attacks being carried out by the Tea Party and the right. Graham said, “Well, in my view, I think attacking this bill in terms of expanding government beyond anybody’s imagination, where 80 percent of the country at the end of the day will be covered by a healthcare bill that is not paid for, that can never be paid for, is a legitimate debate. But when you use the N word and when you question somebody’s patriotism, you’re off base.”

&gt;He took it one step further and defended the president’s character, **“President Obama is a fine man. He’s a good father. He’s a good role model. He’s an American liberal. The reason I don’t say he’s a socialist, because most people associate that with being un-American. He is an American just as much as anybody else. The idea that he’s very liberal I think is pretty clear to the American people. He ran as a centrist, he’s governing from the left ditch, that’s his big problem. And we don’t need to call each other names.”**

&gt;I think Sen. Graham’s position is fair. It is fine for someone to disagree with a policy, without have to resort to racial slurs, and the questioning of patriotism. We can debate endless what I personally feel is Graham’s inaccurate belief that Obama is a liberal, but Graham is basing his criticism on policy, not smearing the president’s character. Sen. Graham has his problems with the right wing and the Tea Party because he supports the climate change bill, and he is working with fellow Meet The Press guest Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on a bi-partisan immigration reform bill. Graham has been recently critical of Obama, because he doesn’t think that the president has shown a deep enough commitment to immigration reform, but his willingness to work together on these two issues has earned him the wrath of Glenn Beck and the Tea Party.

&gt;The easy thing politically for him to do would be to agree with the right wing that Obama is a socialist, and a totalitarian fascist, as most of his fellow Republicans already have. He didn’t have to go to the degree that he did to defend Obama as a person. May people may remember Graham as being on John McCain’s right hand men during the 2008 campaign, but unlike McCain who has completely sold his soul to keep his seat, Graham is at least willing to separate the person from the politics, which is a sorely missed attitude in our country today.",0,1269805329,,0,c0n2juu,t3_bjdi9,1,t3_bjdi9,5073,1426257065,36,False,politics,t5_2cneq,,,2010

Many an enlghtened intellectual think they are objective but operate with totally biased definitions as knowns. Nothing is known a priory, however popular and accepted in a given society. Everything must be rooted in fact. 

In case of your original example it was a nice fine grade argument which ignored the elephant in the room - the central issue that Israel *is not* in fact an apartheid society, because the equality of all before law is upheld by courts, there are no ethnicity-based restrictions in everyday life whatever, and every citizen enjoys full political rights.

The only thing Wikipedia article proves is that there is a massive (and largely successful) attempt to push the ""Israeli apartheid"" meme into the public discourse. Popularity isnt a proof of validity though.

When someone shows me pictures of ""No Arabs and Dogs allowed"" in normal everyday setting in Israel, then I will accept that claim. In the meantime, I know that a fact of life in Israel is that a WB Arab is safe anywhere in Israel, but a Jew will be lynched if he enters an Arab village or town in WB.

Fine.  ALL opiates just got a $100 luxury tax.  Outraged yet?  I'll just keep escalating this until you address what I'm really saying rather than just dancing around the subject.   What about $200?  $500?  At what point will you stop trying to claim a ""luxury tax"" on medicines is justifiable?  And if it's not acceptable at $500, why would it be acceptable at smaller amounts?  

My point is: government has NO business trying to regulate what *medicines* get used by way of putting punishing taxes on them.  If they think the substance in question isn't valid for medicinal use, they're welcome to express that opinion or attempt to regulate its use as medicine.  

&gt;One of the main arguments supporting legalization of marijuana is its taxation. Is this not a step in the right direction? 

Yes.  The *legalization* of marijuana.  Once pot is available for recreational use, I'll be all in favor of taxing it.  However, MEDICINES ARE NOT RECREATIONAL DRUGS.  And you can't pretend to not see any difference between those two things.

You can't claim that, if made legal for medicinal use, marijuana would somehow be in its own very special class of drugs that only it inhabits.  No.  If you make the argument that it's OK to tax marijuana-as-a-drug to stop poor people from being able to use it, then you've gotta be willing to make that argument for ALL drugs.

So, have at it:  what business does the government have levying taxes on drugs so as to punish people for using one prescription medication, but not the other?   Why NOT put a $1000 tax on opiates as a way of discouraging people from using them?

If you can't provide a general justification for this behavior, you can't claim doing it for marijuana specifically is justifiable either.

&gt;I would gladly pay an extra $20 an ounce for marijuana, considering I can go to a doctor and make up just about any problem to have it prescribed.

So because some doctors are unethical, everyone should have to pay a tax?  That makes even less sense than most of your post.  Would it not make more sense to A)*not* tax people unnecessarily, and then B)enforce existing laws to prevent fraudulent prescription-writing?

Why should the whole class get punished, teacher?

jooliver,1238429777.0,,,t2_3fh7u,"&gt;Huh, I was not aware of those. However, Republican congress people were not directly threatened in the way that we've been seeing in the past week. If you want to argue that the radical left is as violent in the US as the radical right...you've got a lot of arguing ahead of you.

It doesn't take a lot of arguing to prove that left and right have just as many quacks, and that they get just as violent and radical. It wasn't just Bush that was threatened with bodily harm. You must have just started keeping up with the news or something??? Here is one example FYI- http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rnc-protests.html


&gt;It isn't just a question of differing opinions - they have their own set of facts. Bush did lie to go to war in Iraq; Bush did  legitimize torture; Bush did grease the skids of the Patriot act. Obama is not a socialist; Obama was born in the US; Obama is not a muslim; there are no death panels in the health bill; the health bill is not a government takeover; etc.

As I said, there are extreme opinion on both sides. I heard many liberal protests that accused Bush of creating 9'11 just to go over to the Middle East and steal oil.....and that is about as substantiated and factually proven as Obama being a Muslim and hating America. The point was that there are some quacks on both sides that spew hate and mis-truth's. However, that does not represent the collective movement, protest, or party as a whole. The core of the tea party does have legitimate reason to be concerned, whether you or I agree with them or not.... Obama *is*  raising taxes to pay for health care; Obama *is* cutting Medicare spending to pay for health care; gov. *is* taking control of student loans; this health care bill *will* mean states will have to come up with more Medicaid dollars, as more people will be eligible; business *will* be taxed if they keep retirees on Rx plans (At&amp;T estimated an additional 1 billion dollars they will have to spend); Everyone *will* have to have health insurance, whether they want it or not, and whether the means justifies the end or not, Obama *did* cut backroom deals with certain congressmen to get health care passed. 

Like I said, you may find those items perfectly okay, but to say that someone else being upset about them is manipulated or not legit is just plain disingenuous.

Not exactly, although Obama did campaign aggressively on health care reform, and the reform we got is even less progressive than what he initially discussed. But no, my argument is Voting for Obama = Less likely to fall for the right's scare tactics. As I keep repeating, less than 50% of Americans think the health care bill is too liberal. In a district where people ignored the McCain/Palin campaign's Obama smears, I would *not* expect the majority of voters to fall for the tea party talking points.

&gt;Regarding your idea that I'm naming guys that did really oppose health care reform, and probably said as much when they were running for office at the same time as Obama, well, if they were running for office on that platform and got elected, don't you think it means that their districts are opposed to health care too?

No, I don't agree with that, but if you can show me that they ran in 2006 on opposition to regulating the health care industry, do provide those details. Still, that's kind of beside the point. We were talking about people who support the bill but pretend they don't. Your examples seemed to be people who don't support the bill.

I don't think thats a fair comparison, and I also don't think there would be an outrage. There are plenty of alternatives to Vicodin as well. Also, you don't think you can get Vicodin cheaper from outside a pharmacy? Either way your paying over its value.

One of the main arguments supporting legalization of marijuana is its taxation. Is this not a step in the right direction? When the other 35 or so states legalize its use medicinally, I believe we can begin to argue against its taxation. 

Because of the broad spectrum of diagnoses its prescribed for, it's not surprising to me that it will be taxed. It's my understanding that for any medical problem you would need Vicodin for, you can have marijuana prescribed for as well. Those options aren't reciprocal. I would gladly pay an extra $20 an ounce for marijuana, considering I can go to a doctor and make up just about any problem to have it prescribed.

Oh dude, fuck you, you have no idea what you're talking about.  The IDF has been been doing it for years.  The Supreme Court ruled it illegal five years ago, but they're still doing it.  BTW- the IDF was fighting for the right to do this in court.

&gt; The Israeli army practice of using Palestinian civilians as ""human shields"" to protect them during arrest operations has been declared illegal by the country's Supreme Court.

&gt;Ruling the practice a violation of international law, Chief Justice Aharon Barak declared: ""You cannot exploit the civilian population for the army's military needs, and you cannot force them to collaborate with the army."" He added: ""Based on this principle, we rule it illegal to use civilians as human shields, and we also rule it illegal to use civilians to pass military warnings from the army to those the army wants to arrest.""

The Republican seismograph registered a shock of 9.8 on the scale of Hitler. The Democrat seismograph registered 9.3 on the scale of Martin Luther King.

Let's say that if we get to the bottom of it, it really is just a bunch of people who have lost their jobs in the economic recession, whom don't know how they are going to pay their next mortgage payment, or feed their kids, or what have you.  What pisses me off is that they are still so goddamn lazy about it.  This is why they are known as the ""me"" generation.  Because its all about ""me, me, me"".  They stand around holding signs, blaming Obama for their troubles (quite possibly the one person who is trying to help them the most), and they sit there and call him a socialist, a fascist, and Hitler.  

Here is another great example of how lazy these people are.  I used to work in a lab.  Made decent money, I was then laid off, and due to the downturn, lab jobs were pretty hard to come by.  My first job after that was a job in Hospitality.  Do you know how many ""middle class white"" people I saw doing a housekeeping job?  Zero.  What is worse, I met this one Hispanic lady, she was in her sixties, looked like my grandmother; she worked 80 hours a week, I shit you not, she put me to shame.  I thought I was hot shit working 60 and yet she was there working 80.  So while all these ""middle class white"" people are all angry and pissed off, and basically waisting their time protesting, what I like to call REAL ""real Americans"", just pulled their sleeves up, and got two jobs, and worked their ass off.  

Finally, this tea bagger movement, angers me so much because it is so fake.  First of all, their anger is being fed by Glenn Beck and Fox ""news"".  By using a bunch of logical fallacies to try and connect anything to socialism.  They may not say it themselves, but they sure love to talk about it.  Then this tea bagger movement, loves to talk about how they were against the Iraq War, and how they were against the Bailouts, etcetera, etcetera, yet these same people voted for George W. Bush, voted For George H.W. Bush, voted for Reagan, some of them might of even voted for Clinton, but he was a corporatist democrat.

I wouldn't label his submissions as trolling. His submissions are noteworthy, even if they are from heavily biased sources. It's always good to be informed of the latest talking points of the Tea Party set.

That being said, yeah, his **comments** (generally) appear to be of dubious value, tending to degrade the level of discourse to, well, the level of this submission's title (""cock in his mouth""? - embarrassing).

But Detokaal's stats speak for themselves:

13,082 link karma
-2,362 comment karma

My advice to Detokaal: Keep the submissions coming. Start leaving more intelligent comments. And use spell check more often ([""Arial photos""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/bjafx/arial_photos_show_100000_at_tea_party_rally_cnn/)? You only posted that one 8 hours ago. Delete and repost it. To be fair - spell check probably wouldn't have caught this.)

EDIT: Delete and repost **them**. He also appears to make duplicate posts across multiple subreddits. Not a crime I suppose. What's the reddiquette on that practice anyway?

EDIT2: I take it all back. Detokaal **is** a troll. His submissions are misleading. I researched his above-mentioned, [""Arial photos""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/bjafx/arial_photos_show_100000_at_tea_party_rally_cnn/) post. His submission title read, *""Arial photos show 100,000 at Tea Party rally. CNN says 'at least dozens'""*.

Untrue. 

#1) [The source he linked to](http://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/03/cnn-on-size-of-todays-searchlight-tea-party-rally-hundreds-of-people-at-least-dozens/) made no such claim as to the crowd's size numbering 100,000.

#2) [Fox News reported yesterday](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/27/tea-party-gears-showdown-searchlight) that they expected some 10,000 activists. Today, Fox reported that some [9,000 people](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/27/gop-candidates-battle-tea-party-endorsement) showed up - which is kinda funny - [Politico's number was 20,000](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/35110.html), but they were quoting a figure from the event's organizers.

#3) I looked at CNN's coverage - I found multiple videos, recorded live on the scene, that showed thousands of people, with the reporter referring to them as [numbering in the thousands](http://cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/politics/2010/03/28/yellin.nv.tea.party.cnn.html).

It's fine to present different sides of an issue.  It's not fine to neglect to fact-check both consistently.

But I think I've just realized the rub...  Let's say a reporter interviews both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin regarding the health care issue.  From what I've heard of Obama, he's usually pretty strong on his facts.  With Sarah Palin, it is an understatement to say that the opposite is true.  So when the reporter fact-checks both, 95% of his corrections are going to be for Palin, which makes it appear to some like he's biased in favor of Obama.

I asked him on what specific issues, he could offer no insight. Surprisingly, the opposed Bush as well, but get this: **they oppose using renewable energy**. 

Furthermore, I asked what their opinion was on ecological degradation. They said that ""ACTUALLY wherever humans go it gets greener"" and that ""we are making the Earth better."" I couldn't even swallow that tidbit of information down, so I asked him ""Really? What about the fact that there the levels of plastics in the ocean is seven times that of the zooplankton? Do you think that's better for the environment?"" Cue his stuttering and loss for words: Suddenly his cult training had failed to properly equip him with a response. ""We, uh, well- we don't support that policy.."" Policy? What? That's a fact, what the fuck is he talking about? 

I asked him if he was getting paid to be out here, and he started laughing and called me something under his breath and walked away.

The first armed conflict erupted in 1950, when forces from the northern half of Korea, which had been placed under Russian supervision after World War II, invaded the U.S.-controlled south. The United States and its allies, fearing communist ambition, agreed to help defend the south under the United Nations banner. By the time General MacArthur organized the movement of troops and war supplies, South Korean forces had been pushed into the far southern tip of the Korean peninsula. On September 15, 1950, in one of the most daring and successful military maneuvers of modern times, MacArthur landed troops at Inchon, far behind North Korean lines. The result was a rout of enemy forces, and the North Koreans were pushed back nearly to China. Fearing an invasion of its territory, China joined the war and launched a full-blown counterattack.

memefilter,1222368394.0,,,t2_3943u,"Hey /r/politics... 

First I have to say that me even posting this to this subreddit is a testament to hope, as the vast evidence suggests most would rather foam at the mouth about left vs right than actually do any political analysis.  However, let's get a few things straight.

1: There is no ""tea party"".  A few Ron Paul supporters decided to take that name for a few meetups, waaaay back in '08.  The last big tea party rally was attended by ~500 people, including dipshits like Palin and Tancredo, and they spoke to no-one but a bunch of GOP party hacks looking to make a buck off of Ron's grass roots.  They didn't.  This rally, which organizers said *might* get up to 10k attendees, looks like it topped out at maybe 1k.  So when they talk about how Palin is a ""tea party leader"" they mean she's a retard who gets no respect from serious activists.  Attempts to funnel the libertarian/anarchist movement into the two parties has failed spectacularly, and the effort to make a third party is even funnier.  If you look at the LP's numbers over the past 20 years, they're dead and beginning to stink, which retard Wayne Allen Root will only hasten.

2: The MSM (as well as /r/politics) keeps referring to this ""tea party"" as representing a vast mob of angry racist idiots.  Yet the only racist idiots are the likes of Tancredo and Palin.  Libertarians are *famously* the least racist crowd in politics, because they are meritocratists.  They don't care about skin color or religion or sexual preference, because they believe you are free to decide for yourself what you like, and as long as you don't infringe on someone else you can be whomever you want.  But the MSM keeps shoveling that line of horseshit, because they have been co-opted since the days of Operation Mockingbird.  Anderson Cooper is CIA.  Obama is CIA.  The Bushes are CIA, and all of that rolls back into a pattern so simple even you can understand it: state propaganda.

3: Salon is propaganda, their polls are propaganda.  FOX is propaganda.  Rachel Maddow is propaganda.  Amy Goodman is propaganda.  And /r/politics is filled with propaganda, just like this article.

4: There really is a revolution going on in this country, but it is not the teabaggers (a few thousand useful idiots), the GOP (open Nazis since before WW2), nor is it the Democrats (leftovers from the American Communist Party) or the Greens (a front for the U.N.).  It is about 200mil people who have woken up from a long slumber of thinking America could do no wrong.  We are ALL anti-war.  We are ALL anti-DC.  We are ALL anti-fiat money.  Most of us are better educated than the fools who thought Obama represented any real change.  Most of us are well aware that the health ""reform"" bill is nothing but a reach-around for the insurance lobby.  And virtually all of us are far too smart to fall for the left vs right divide and conquer tactic.

5: Because of points 1-4 you're in for a helluva surprise if you think we give a shit about Congress.  If you think we're going to protests and waving signs, you grossly underestimate how far our strategies transcend meaningless theater.  If you think we watch FOX or NPR anymore you clearly don't have access to the information vectors we've built.

And if you think circle-jerking in this echo chamber about how the left is superior to the right, or vice versa, has any bearing on our decision making - hey, be my fucking guest.  You're inability to read the writing on the wall renders you incapable of either effecting real change or preventing us from doing so.  You are as irrelevant as Palin and Hillary and Bush and Gore and Blair and Murdoch are.  Anachronisms.  Too ignorant and arrogant to get out of the way of the unstoppable juggernaut that is rational anarchism.

Pretty much. The only thing stopping people from stealing your shit is the government.

It's capital punishment for criminals. They use it a bit more liberally there. It's not necessarily right or wrong. They don't use capital punishment as a deterrent for crime. It's just to get rid of people that are essentially ""bad"" (for example intentionally putting cheap poisonous ingredients in baby food).

Even if you look at the guy who flew the plane into the IRS building, those IRS employees aren't behind some nefarious scheme, they're just trying to do their job.""

&gt;I wont condemn the attacks because they had a purpose that I believe was appropriate in the times. Also, the government did kill children in both Ruby Ridge and Waaco incidents. I'm not saying I WANTED innocent people to die, but on the other hand I don't think it makes the attack suddenly devoid of meaning or purpose. The US shot a 14 year old boy to death, and killed numerous children in the Waaco disaster. Some of them infants. And if attacks were carried out on empty buildings, what impact would it have? It would be trivialized by the media and would have no real impact on the cause either. A destroyed federal building has only monetary costs that are reimbursed through insurance companies. The loss of life sends a message and gets people talking.

You know,  the muslim terrorists think the exact same thing.   Violence doesn't solve the problem,  but it gets it into discussion...yeah,  that doesn't work.   Second,  do not even try to compare the death of the children at Waco or Ruby Ridge to this.   They're both tragic,  but it isn't a tit for tat,  it's okay because they did it sort of thing.   This type of thinking is really fucked up,  you sir,  are fucked up.

&gt;&gt;""And as for the things you just listed, yes, I know about those. Do I think they are right? No. Of course not. I think it is too easy to lump people in to either say they hate the government or love the government and think it does no wrong. Just because I'm not an anti-state doesn't mean I think the government is perfect. Those are HUGE problems, and there are many, many more. But just because of those doesn't indict the whole system.""

&gt;While I partially agree with you, I think the main issue is that these policies are to me part of the ideals of our modern government. They speak to the direction and intention of future policy and procedure. You just have to take a step back and realize how radical these policies are. Warrant less searches in itself should be enough to get most people with a head on their shoulders red in the face. We're talking serious serious issues here. The kind of stuff a generation or two ago people would have died for.

Warrant-less searches,  I'm not too keen on.  However, I really don't think these are an issue we will be dealing with outside of some cases where it is restricted to the gathering of foreign intelligence (as per Ames).  If agents kicked in your door and found a sex dungeon full of children during the search for foreign intelligence related materials,  I doubt even that would be admissible due to the 4th amendment on the subject.  If you can cite me some examples of the use of such warrantless searches,  I'd be appreciative.  And don't give me probable cause causes,  because probable cause implies warranted search. 

&gt;There is no shortage of history in which these events transpire into disastrous results. We are repeating history. It is likely we are on the tail end of this government and socioeconomic structure's lifespan. No structure has lasted this long, and none will ever last forever. The idea that we can manage a society with a government and set of rules is one that has failed throughout the existence of humanity. It will never work over the long term.

&gt;The only long term solution is for people to cooperate with each other and to have a higher meaning in their life collectively than producing and collecting useless shit.

&gt;So the problem is higher than government, its the socio-economic system. Capitalism is not a sustainable system and we're starting to see some of the stress cracks.

A libertarian saying this?  I'm somewhat confused.  What do you suggest?  Socialism?  No,  definitely not...Anarchy?  no no... Monarchy maybe?  Maybe a Theocracy,  that's sustainable right?

&gt;What we're seeing, is an effort for the government to maintain continuity (seeking its self interest over the interests of the people, in the name of the people) by expanding its powers in the event of a collapse of confidence. Think the 1930s.

&gt;Its absolutely no coincidence that we're seeing an expansion of government power as we see a decline in the solvency of our government and our position as a world super power.

&gt;&gt;""And why is there a need for an imbalance? I don't own guns, or tanks, or bombs, or anything like that, but there are civilian militias that are. What's to stop them from becoming tyrannical? From my perspective, many of the militias see violence as power, but where does that leave people who don't see it that way? From where I'm standing, tyranny doesn't have to just come from those in power, it can also come from people trying to forcibly alter my way of life, and that seems to be the whole goal of these ""radicals"". The same way they don't appreciate a government encroaching on them, I don't appreciate them encroaching on me.""

&gt;I would think a tyranny generally infers a large body able to control the majority. A single militia isn't capable of something of that level.

China is estimated to have execute 5,000 people in 2009 [citation](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8432514.stm), the highest of any nation on Earth.  Even if taken as a ratio of population to executions.

But here's the real point of my prior comment:  THere is a theory that a state's government is rooted in its ability to use force.  That the people it governs willingly or unwillingly give their consent for the government to use force is what allows the government to uphold its own laws and function.  Check out this site: it's an interesting primer to the idea that no matter how benign the government - it's ultimately the gun in its pocket that really allows it to work.

""Semitic"" means someone from a culture that speaks a Semitic language, which we could generalize to ""most Middle-Eastern cultures"".  *Anti-Semitic*, however, specifically means ""anti-Jewish"", because that term was created as a polite, racialized way of saying ""anti-Jewish"" for the advanced cultures of the 19th and 20th centuries.

If you'd like to undo the semantic conflation that some 19th-century German guy made simply because Jews were the only Semites in Germany, be my guest, and we can discuss Judeophobia.

&gt;""Zionist"" is perceived as meaning many different things as well. Some have used it to reference the religion, some the group as a whole(as is common amongst Israel's enemies), and some as a belief based on religion(and some probably several other things)

What group?  Zionism is Jewish nationalism.  One who upholds such an ideology is a Zionist, and this means that most Zionists are not actually Jews.  They agree with Zionism just as they agree with the existence of France.

In the other two aspects you are basically correct, but you miss something: the conflation of these with each other is the central component of political anti-Semitism, the creation of the Straw Jew.  By doing so anti-Semitism denies the internal diversity of Jews and Jewry themselves, making action against Jewry as a whole justifiable.

And as I said, once the Straw Jew exists, any contradictory action by actual Jews, Zionists, or Israelis can be explained away by the Judeophobe/anti-Semite as a cover for the conspiracy.  That's the dangerous thing: through its logically incoherent delusions, political Judeophobia/anti-Semitism gains an invulnerability to facts.",0,1269812016,,0,c0n2r0i,t3_bjaoy,8,t1_c0n2i26,8362,1426257157,0,False,politics,t5_2cneq,,,2010

eaturbrainz,1210968944.0,,,t2_35c2y,"I think it's 1/3 the former, 1/3 the latter, and 1/3 prejudiced pseudo-criticism of Israel being used as cover for pro-Arab partisanship.  Yes, the State of Israel has done some things to which I, and any person who shares my moral axioms, must object.  On the other hand, a great many of the so-called ""criticisms"" of Israel are founded on the assumption that Israel and Jews are somehow different from all other states and peoples, specifically that they lack certain rights and must be held to higher moral standards.  Most of the others assume, prima facie, the truth of the Arab/Palestinian historiography and moral axioms.

For evidence, ask any Zionist (or Israeli propagandist, if you wish ;-)) to tell you about the positive, beneficial, and moral things that Israel and Israelis have done -- not merely for Jews but for humanity as a whole.  There's actually a fair list of such things, particularly in the realms science, technology, and archaeology.  However, many critics of Israel will discard these things as having no redeeming value for Israel at all.  To them, the inherent evil of Israel's existence - coupled to an extremely common historical ignorance (for example, how many so-called anti-Zionists will acknowledge that Israel offered to return all lands captured in the 1967 War, minus Old Jerusalem, immediately after the war?) - poison every single thing that the state does or sponsors.  This is, on its face, definitely a prejudice or hatred against the State of Israel.

Then we consider the fact that these ""critics"", who claim most commonly to favor universal human rights, judge Israel by a completely different standard from all other states?  For example, they call for boycotts of Israeli goods (including all recent Intel CPUs, for example) but not for boycotts of China -- whose abuses of human rights are far worse.  When questioned on this, they resort to an open moral pragmatism of saying that they have far more ability to remove Israeli products from their lives than Chinese ones, despite the fact that they don't spend nearly as much time merely *verbally criticizing* China as they do Israel.

Furthermore, anyone familiar with the notion of human rights should know that the UN Declaration of Universal Human Rights explicitly enshrines a human right to national self-determination.  When questioned as to why Israel is not a valid exercise of Jewish self-determination, so-called ""critics"" of Israel tend to split into three camps whose arguments can, unfortunately, intermix: those who admit that it is but criticize its actions (genuine, honest criticism), those who claim that a validly self-determining state cannot be founded on stolen land (pro-Arab partisans), those who claim that Jews are not a people with a right to self-determination (anti-Semites), and those who claim that no right to ethnonational self-determination exists (anti-Semites, since they argue against Israel rather than, say, the UK and the Scandinavian nations, even while Israel is far less a monoethnic or monoracial society than the UK or any Scandinavian nation).

Finally, yes, the State of Israel makes moral mistakes.  There is no state in the world that hasn't and doesn't.  I am 100% against the settlement movement and the occupation of the West Bank for non-security purposes, *as a Zionist*, precisely because my Zionism derives from a belief in the equality and self-determination of all peoples, *including the Jewish people, my own people*.  I am against the limiting of humanitarian aid into Gaza, though I find it quite difficult to find evidence of its limitation to the point of ""humanitarian crisis"" while anti-Semites and pro-Arab partisans shout about the ""deliberate starvation of Gaza"".  I believe in the immediate need for a civilian national service program in Israel that will allow Arab Israelis to serve their country and gain the benefits therefrom that Jewish Israelis obtain by going to the army at age 18.  I believe that prejudiced funding differentials between Jewish and Arab municipalities should be eliminated.

None of these things, however, poisons, spoils, or refutes my fundamental belief in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in the form of the State of Israel.  When I hear ""criticism"" of Israel that argues against that right on the basis of Israel's actual sins, or ""criticism"" based in completely fictitious sins (such as the notion that Israel is conducting a deliberate genocide), I cannot help but see that as anti-Semitism because it *is* anti-Semitism: it uses a mixture of truths and falsehoods to argue that the Jewish people lacks a right that all other peoples possess by default, and save its false factual axioms (such as the notion that Israel is not a liberal democracy but an apartheid state) and their implications (that America supports an apartheid state) from Occam's Razor, it rehabilitates conspiracy theories that come straight from the oldest anti-Semitic canards (example: a body of Jews manipulates Americans and the American government in order to funnel money to a central Jewish polity, in this case Israel).

**TL;DR: A substantial part of the criticism Israel receives is well-founded, just like any country.  However, a larger and growing part of the criticism Israel receives is indeed founded in either pro-Arab partisanship (such as the belief that the Jewish right to the land is forever inferior to the Arab right) or outright anti-Semitism, and often the former is used to justify the latter (and thereby inadvertently swallowed by people who took up solidarity with the Arabs and adopted their historiography for a noble purpose).**",0,1269813404,,0,c0n2sgb,t3_bjaoy,8,t1_c0n2dk6,14126,1426257176,2,False,politics,t5_2cneq,,1.0,2010

As for me I don't see how I could fight for the current order. It has shown a callous disregard for human life. From the genocide and ghettoization of the natives to the slavery and ghettoization of the blacks. From the aggressive imperialist wars to the pollution and corruption. The system we have now is disgusting and needs to die. No end could be to soon for it. That system created the situations we have to deal with to this very day. The ones that are bringing us to the brink. And all for fucking dollar bills.

But that said. Everything you state about the rebel faction is true. Worse is true of them. Their bigotry and racism is beyond the pall. Some of those ""rebels"" are still longing for the return of slavery even though their own ancestors are white trash or carpet baggers and were never plantation owners. Furthermore I do not think mercy or obedience to any of the laws of honorable warfare can be expected from the rebel side. I don't expect it from the loyalist side either but I reckon the loyalists will have the most to lose by atrocity.

So from my perspective I couldn't fight for either side. I'm going west with my family and friends. I'm going to start a tribe and try to live in a way I can defend inside my soul.
